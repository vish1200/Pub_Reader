Phase II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed Plus Bevacizumab with Maintenance Bevacizumab as a First-line Treatment for Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Elderly Patients.,/pubmed/29848743,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The combination of platinum-doublet chemotherapy with bevacizumabhas been established as a first-line treatment option in non-elderly patientswith non-squamous (non-sq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, thesafety and efficacy of this regimen have not yet been fully established inelderly patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemo-na´ve patients with non-sq NSCLC, aged _75 years,having a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1) and adequate organ function were considered eligible. Patientsreceived carboplatin (area under the curve=5 mg/ml/min), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed bymaintenance bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate(ORR; target=50%, threshold=30%; Simon's two-stage design), and the secondaryendpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival(OS).RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled from June 2013 to July 2017. The study wasclosed because of slow patient accrual. The median patient age was 80 years.Eleven patients (92%) completed 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Sevenpatients achieved a partial response (PR), yielding an ORR of 58%. The median PFSwas 8.4 [95% confidence interval (CI)=4.4-10.5] months, and the median OS was33.9 (95%CI=13.2-43.3) months. Toxicities were generally mild and consistent withprevious reports. There were no treatment-related deaths.CONCLUSION: A regimen comprising carboplatin and pemetrexed plus bevacizumabfollowed by maintenance bevacizumab is feasible and potentially efficacious inelderly patients with non-sq NSCLC.",RCT,,,,carboplatin,pemetrexed,bevacizumab,,non-squamous (non-sq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),objective response rate,
Oral Metronomic Vinorelbine in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Unfit for Chemotherapy.,/pubmed/29848729,"AIM: To explore the feasibility and activity of oral metronomic vinorelbinepatients with advanced NSCLC not eligible to standard chemotherapy because of oldage (_70 years), and/or poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performancestatus (_2), and/or extensive brain or bone disease, and/or active comorbidities (_2) requiring for pharmacological treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective phase II not randomized study, patientswith stage IV NSCLC unfit to chemotherapy were treated with oral metronomicvinorelbine at 30 mg fixed dose three times a week until disease progression.RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated, 19 (38%) in the first-line setting. Fivepatients (11%) experienced a grade 3 toxicity; no grade 4 toxicity occurred.Overall disease control rate was 32%, 44% and 26% in first and subsequent lines, respectively (p=0.39). Median OS and PFS were 7.3 months (95% confidence interval[CI]=4.7-10.0) and 2.7 months (95%CI=2.0-3.4), respectively.CONCLUSION: These data support the activity and safety of metronomic vinorelbine in a relevant proportion of patients usually excluded from any specifictreatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association of Colonoscopy Adenoma Findings With Long-term Colorectal Cancer Incidence.,/pubmed/29800214,"Importance: Individuals with adenomatous polyps are advised to undergo repeatedcolonoscopy surveillance to prevent subsequent colorectal cancer (CRC), but therelationship between adenomas at colonoscopy and long-term CRC incidence isunclear.Objective: To compare long-term CRC incidence by colonoscopy adenoma findings.Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, prospective cohort study ofparticipants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancerrandomized clinical trial of flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) beginning in 1993 with follow-up for CRC incidence to 2013 across the United States. Participantsincluded 154_900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years enrolled in PLCO of whom15_935 underwent colonoscopy following their first positive FSG screening result.The final day of follow-up was December 31, 2013.Exposures: Enrolled participants had been randomized to FSG or usual care.Participants who underwent FSG and had abnormal findings were referred forfollow-up. Subsequent colonoscopy findings were categorized as advanced adenoma(_1 cm, high-grade dysplasia, or tubulovillous or villous histology), nonadvancedadenoma (<1 cm without advanced histology), or no adenoma.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was CRC incidence within 15 yearsof the baseline colonoscopy. The secondary outcome was CRC mortality.Results: There were 15_935 participants who underwent colonoscopy (men, 59.7%;white, 90.7%; median age, 64 y [IQR, 61-68]). On initial colonoscopy, 2882participants (18.1%) had an advanced adenoma, 5068 participants (31.8%) had anonadvanced adenoma, and 7985 participants (50.1%) had no adenoma; medianfollow-up for CRC incidence was 12.9 years. CRC incidence rates per 10_000person-years of observation were 20.0 (95% CI, 15.3-24.7; n_=_70) for advancedadenoma, 9.1 (95% CI, 6.7-11.5; n_=_55) for nonadvanced adenoma, and 7.5 (95% CI,5.8-9.7; n_=_71) for no adenoma. Participants with advanced adenoma weresignificantly more likely to develop CRC compared with participants with noadenoma (rate ratio [RR], 2.7 [95% CI, 1.9-3.7]; P_<_.001). There was nosignificant difference in CRC risk between participants with nonadvanced adenoma compared with no adenoma (RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.7]; P_=_.30). Compared withparticipants with no adenoma, those with advanced adenoma were at significantlyincreased risk of CRC death (RR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2-5.7], P_=_.01), but mortalityrisk in participants with nonadvanced adenoma was not significantly different(RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.5-2.7], P_=_.68).Conclusions and Relevance: Over a median of 13 years of follow-up, participantswith an advanced adenoma at diagnostic colonoscopy prompted by a positiveflexible sigmoidoscopy result were at significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with those with no adenoma. Identification ofnonadvanced adenoma may not be associated with increased colorectal cancer risk.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00002540.",N,,,,,,,,Colorectal carcinoma CRC,Colorectal carcinoma CRC  incidence within 15 years,
Early tumor shrinkage served as a prognostic factor for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.,/pubmed/29742701,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death. About 80% ofpatients are diagnosed at stage III in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Itis extremely important to understand the progression of this disease which haslow survival times despite the advancing treatment modalities. We aimed toinvestigate the relationship between early tumor shrinkage (ETS) after initialconcurrent chemoradiotherapy (C-CRT) and survival outcome in patients with stage III (NSCLC).METHODS: A retrospective review of 103 patients with stage III NSCLC who hadreceived C-CRT from January 2006 to October 2011 was performed. Patients weretreated with systemic chemotherapy regimen of Cisplatin/Vp-16 and concurrentthoracic radiotherapy at a median dose of 66 Gy (range 60-70_Gy). All patientsreceived a computed tomography (CT) examination before treatment. Alsosubsequently, chest CT scans were performed with the same imaging parameters atapproximately 5 weeks after the initiation of treatment. ETS is here stratifiedby a decrease in tumor size _30% and <30% in the longest dimension of the target lesion within 5 weeks.RESULTS: Of the 103 patients, 59 ones showed a 30% decrease in tumor size, andthe rest displayed a decrease of <30%. ETS showed no significant correlation withage, T classification, N classification, histological classification, smokingstatus, G classification, EGFR status, or acute pulmonary toxicity. In thecurrent retrospective clinical study, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patientswith ETS___30% had a better progression-free survival and overall survival. Theunivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that ETS_<_30% was associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer-related death (P_<_.05) in stage IIINSCLC.CONCLUSIONS: ETS may be served as a useful prognostic factor to predict theoutcome of stage III NSCLC patients treated with CCRT.",N,,,,,,,,stage III NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer),early tumor shrinkage (ETS),
"[A multicenter, large-sample, randomized clinical trial on improving the median survival time of advanced non-small cell lung cancer by combination of Ginseng Rg3 and chemotherapy].",/pubmed/29730918,"Objective: To observe the efficacy of the combination of chemotherapy and GinsengRg3 on advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Methods: In the multi-center, large-sample, randomized, double blind trial, 414 patients with _-_ NSCLC wereenrolled.199 were in the experimental group and 215 the control group. Thepatients in the experimental group were treated with the standard first-linechemotherapy combined with Ginseng Rg3. The patients in the control group weretreated with the same chemotherapy combined with placebo. Median overall survival(OS), Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)symptoms score and side effects of two groups were observed as main indexes.Results: The median OS were 12.03 months in the experimental group, which wassignificantly better than that in the control group (8.46 months, P<0.05).Hemoglobin and white blood cells were decreased after the first and second cycle of treatment in both groups. Both adverse events were significantly milder in thetreatment group (P<0.05). In addition, after two courses of treatment, the KPS ofpatients was 78.95±9.14 in the experimental group and 76.77±9.15 in the controlgroup, while the TCM symptoms score was 2.45±1.73 in the experimental group and2.92±2.06 in the control group, with significant difference (P<0.05).Conclusions: Combination of TCM with Western medicine such as chemotherapy could prolong the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.

Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29658856,"BACKGROUND: First-line therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)that lacks targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patientswith a tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% orgreater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-linetreatment of choice. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted insignificantly higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in a phase 2 trial.METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1ratio) 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR orALK mutations who had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease toreceive pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo forup to a total of 35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover topembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted among the patients in theplacebo-combination group who had verified disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival, as assessed byblinded, independent central radiologic review.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overallsurvival at 12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) inthe pembrolizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in theplacebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64;P<0.001). Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categoriesthat were evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to5.5) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression ordeath, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in65.8% of those in the placebo-combination group.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLCwithout EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standardchemotherapy of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantlylonger overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.(Funded by Merck; KEYNOTE-189 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02578680 .).",RCT,,,,200 mg of pembrolizumab,Placebo,,,"metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer without sensitizing EGFR orALK mutations",overall survival and progression-free survival,
Neoadjuvant PD-1 Blockade in Resectable Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29658848,"BACKGROUND: Antibodies that block programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein improvesurvival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but havenot been tested in resectable NSCLC, a condition in which little progress hasbeen made during the past decade.METHODS: In this pilot study, we administered two preoperative doses of PD-1inhibitor nivolumab in adults with untreated, surgically resectable early (stage I, II, or IIIA) NSCLC. Nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, with surgery planned approximately 4 weeks after the first dose. The primary end points of the study were safety andfeasibility. We also evaluated the tumor pathological response, expression ofprogrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), mutational burden, and mutation-associated,neoantigen-specific T-cell responses.RESULTS: Neoadjuvant nivolumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and was not associated with delays in surgery. Of the 21 tumors that were removed, 20 werecompletely resected. A major pathological response occurred in 9 of 20 resectedtumors (45%). Responses occurred in both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negativetumors. There was a significant correlation between the pathological response andthe pretreatment tumor mutational burden. The number of T-cell clones that werefound in both the tumor and peripheral blood increased systemically after PD-1blockade in eight of nine patients who were evaluated. Mutation-associated,neoantigen-specific T-cell clones from a primary tumor with a complete responseon pathological assessment rapidly expanded in peripheral blood at 2 to 4 weeksafter treatment; some of these clones were not detected before the administrationof nivolumab.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant nivolumab was associated with few side effects, did not delay surgery, and induced a major pathological response in 45% of resectedtumors. The tumor mutational burden was predictive of the pathological responseto PD-1 blockade. Treatment induced expansion of mutation-associated,neoantigen-specific T-cell clones in peripheral blood.

Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in Lung Cancer with a High Tumor Mutational Burden.,/pubmed/29658845,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed promising efficacy for the treatmentof non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a phase 1 trial, and tumor mutationalburden has emerged as a potential biomarker of benefit. In this part of anopen-label, multipart, phase 3 trial, we examined progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy among patients with a high tumormutational burden (_10 mutations per megabase).METHODS: We enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was notpreviously treated with chemotherapy. Those with a level of tumor programmeddeath ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of at least 1% were randomly assigned, in a1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, orchemotherapy; those with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of less than 1% wererandomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab,nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Tumor mutational burden wasdetermined by the FoundationOne CDx assay.RESULTS: Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutationalburden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than withchemotherapy. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-freesurvival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58;97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 45.3% withnivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9% with chemotherapy. The benefit of nivolumabplus ipilimumab over chemotherapy was broadly consistent within subgroups,including patients with a PD-L1 expression level of at least 1% and those with a level of less than 1%. The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy. ical;CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477826 .).CONCLUSIONS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with first-linenivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor mutational burden, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level.

Feasibility Study of Sequentially Alternating EGFR-TKIs and Chemotherapy for Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29599365,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the feasibility andefficacy of alternating platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with epidermal growthfactor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in patients withEGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC harboringan EGFR mutation were enrolled. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy by sequentially alternating pemetrexed/cisplatin/bevacizumab and EGFR-TKIs followed by maintenance therapy with pemetrexed/bevacizumab and EGFR-TKIs. The primaryoutcome was the completion rate of the induction therapy.RESULTS: Eighteen eligible patients were enrolled between May 2011 and March2016. The completion rate of induction therapy was 72.2% (13/18). Unfortunately, one patient developed grade 4 acute renal injury, but no other seriouscomplications concerning this protocol were observed. Furthermore, diarrhea,rashes, and hematological adverse effects were mild.CONCLUSION: The completion rate of induction therapy was promising.

Expression of Estrogen Receptor-± and Survival in Advanced-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29599348,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The favorable prognosis of women with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to men might be explained by sex hormone-related mechanisms. We investigated whether this observation could be explained by the expression ofestrogen receptor-alpha (ER-_) in tumor tissue.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissuesamples were retrospectively analyzed for nuclear expression of ER-_ withimmunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Biopsies from 222 patients were analyzed. Twenty-three percent were ER-_positive. Fifty-four percent of the patients were men and 46% of the tumors were adenocarcinomas. One hundred-nine (49%) patients received pemetrexed andcarboplatin and 113 (51%) received gemcitabine and carboplatin. Females with ER-_positive tumors who received PC had a substantial survival benefit over all othergroups (20 vs. 4.6 months; p=0.003).CONCLUSION: ER-_ is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC and might also be a predictive factor for response to pemetrexed/carboplatin in women.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sterilized talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusions: a Phase II study for investigational new drug application in Japan.,/pubmed/29528450,"Background: Malignant pleural effusion is a commonly seen complication ofmalignancies such as lung and breast cancers. In Western countries, talc isfrequently used as a standard therapeutic agent (pleurodesis agent) with the aim of alleviating symptoms including dyspnea and chest pain. Talc is not recognized as a pleurodesis agent in Japan. The aim of this study was to verify the efficacyand safety of sterilized talc (NPC-05) for the introduction of talc in Japan.Methods: The study was a single-arm, open-label, investigator-initiated trialconducted jointly at six institutions. The subjects were 30 patients withmalignant pleural effusions. A solution of 4 g NPC-05 suspended in 50 mlphysiological saline was instilled into the pleural space to perform pleurodesis.Results: The efficacy of NPC-05 for pleural adhesion 30 days after pleurodesiswas 83.3% (25/30 cases). Amelioration of dyspnea and pain (chest pain) was seen. Commonly seen adverse effects were increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and fever. Nearly all adverse events were phenomena previously reported as adverse effectsof talc. No acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other serious sideeffects occurred.Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of NPC-05 for malignant pleural effusion inJapanese patients was verified, and the clinical outcomes with talc wereconfirmed to be the same as previously reported in other countries. There isthought to be a high level of need for this agent in the treatment of malignantpleural effusion in Japan.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 1 study of ombrabulin in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.,/pubmed/29514256,"Background: The combination use of the vascular disrupting agent ombrabulin with chemotherapeutic agents was previously shown to be highly synergistic inpreclinical models.Methods: In this dose-escalation study of ombrabulin (15.5-35 mg/m2) incombination with docetaxel (60 or 75 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2), agents wereadministered 24 h apart every 3 weeks to Japanese patients with advanced solidtumors. The study was designed and conducted in a 3 + 3 manner. Safety, tumorresponse and pharmacokinetics were evaluated.Results: Eleven patients with non small cell lung cancer as the primary tumorwere treated. Two patients out of five had dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) inCycle 1 at the starting doses of ombrabulin 15.5 mg/m2, docetaxel 60 mg/m2 andcisplatin 75 mg/m2. Thus, dose escalation was terminated. The first dose levelwas re-evaluated in six patients who received prophylactic granulocyte-colonystimulating factor (G-CSF). However, because of the occurrence of DLTs in Cycle 1in two patients out of six, the study was led to the premature terminationwithout pursued upper dose level. Partial response was observed in four patients out of 11. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ombrabulin and cisplatin were notaltered in this combination treatment, while docetaxel clearance decreased by~40% compared to that observed with docetaxel monotherapy at the same dose (60mg/m2).Conclusion: A combination regimen of ombrabulin with cisplatin and docetaxel was not feasible for Japanese patients owing to the occurrence of hematological andnon-hematological DLTs at the initial dose level.Clinical trial registration ID: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01095302.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in onepatient in each arm: Grade 3 central-nervous system metastases inceritinib-treated patient and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia in chemotherapy-treatedpatient.Conclusions: Consistent with overall population, ceritinib demonstrated betterefficacy compared with the standard second-line chemotherapy in Japanese patientswith crizotinib-resistant ALK+ NSCLC.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01828112.",RCT,,,,ceritinib,chemotherapy,,,anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer,progression-free survival,
"Credentialing of radiotherapy centres in Australasia for TROG 09.02 (Chisel), a Phase III clinical trial on stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy of early stage lung cancer.",/pubmed/29446317,"OBJECTIVE: A randomised clinical trial comparing stereotactic ablative bodyradiotherapy (SABR) with conventional radiotherapy for early stage lung cancerhas been conducted in Australia and New Zealand under the auspices of theTransTasman Radiation Oncology Group (NCT01014130). We report on the technicalcredentialing program as prerequisite for centres joining the trial.METHODS: Participating centres were asked to develop treatment plans for two testcases to assess their ability to create plans according to protocol. Dosedelivery in the presence of inhomogeneity and motion was assessed during a sitevisit using a phantom with moving inserts.RESULTS: Site visits for the trial were conducted in 16 Australian and 3 NewZealand radiotherapy facilities. The tests with low density inhomogeneitiesconfirmed shortcomings of the AAA algorithm for dose calculation. Dose wasassessed for a typical treatment delivery including at least one non-coplanarbeam in a stationary and moving phantom. This end-to-end test confirmed that all participating centres were able to deliver stereotactic ablative bodyradiotherapy with the required accuracy while the planning study demonstratedthat they were able to produce acceptable plans for both test cases.CONCLUSION: The credentialing process documented that participating centres were able to deliver dose as required in the trial protocol. It also gave anopportunity to provide education about the trial and discuss technical issuessuch as four-dimensional¾CT, small field dosimetry and patient immobilisationwith staff in participating centres. Advances in knowledge: Credentialing is animportant quality assurance tool for radiotherapy trials using advancedtechnology. In addition to confirming technical competence, it provides anopportunity for education and discussion about the trial.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Phase II Study of Irinotecan for Patients with Previously Treated Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29444512,"OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy with irinotecan plus cisplatin has shown promise inchemo-na´ve small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. However, irinotecan treatmentfor relapsed or refractory SCLC has not been adequately evaluated. This phase II study evaluated the appropriate treatment schedule of irinotecan as a singleagent. This study was designed to determine the antitumor activity, toxicity, andsurvival in previously treated SCLC patients.METHODS: Previously treated SCLC patients with at least one platinum-basedregimen received irinotecan (100 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks, untildisease progression. The assessment of the response rate was the primaryendpoint.RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled, with an objective response rate of 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.5-59.3), and a disease control rate of 69%.Median progression-free and overall survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.2-5.4) and10.4 months (95% CI, 8.1-14), respectively. The grade 3/4 hematologicaltoxicities were neutropenia (36.7%), thrombocytopenia (3.3%), anemia (13.3%), andfebrile neutropenia (6.6%). There were no grade 4 nonhematological toxicities.Frequent grade 3 nonhematological toxicities included diarrhea (10%), anorexia(6.6%), and hyponatremia (6.6%).CONCLUSIONS: This phase II study showed a high objective response rate and longsurvival. Irinotecan monotherapy schedule used was well tolerated, and could bean active treatment option for these patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel monotherapy as second-line therapy of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29390506,"BACKGROUND: Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX), which avoidstoxicities associated with a vehicle used in solvent-based PTX, has already shownsafety and efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: A phase II study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy ofnab-PTX monotherapy as second-line chemotherapy after cytotoxic anticancer drugs for previously treated advanced NSCLC. Thirty-two patients with advanced NSCLCwho had previously undergone 1 regimen of cytotoxic anticancer drugs wereenrolled. Nab-PTX was administered intravenously at a dose of 100_mg/m on days 1,8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The objective response rate (ORR), disease controlrate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity profile were evaluated.RESULTS: The ORR was 28.1%, the DCR was 71.9%, median PFS was 3.9 months (95%confidence interval [CI] 2.7-5.1 months), and median OS was 10.9 months (95% CI9.5-12.3 months). The mean relative dose intensity of nab-PTX was 77%. Grade 3 or4 neutropenia, and grade 3 febrile neutropenia were observed in 11 and 1 of 32patients, respectively.

Materials and Methods This study was approved bythe institutional review board and conducted under a U.S. Food and DrugAdministration-approved Investigational New Drug application in accordance withthe Helsinki Declaration and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. All patients provided written informed consent. Between January 2013 andOctober 2016, 25 adult patients with cancer received an intravenous bolus of FGlntracer (mean, 244 MBq ± 118, <100 _g) followed by positron emission tomography(PET) and blood radioassays. Patient data were summarized with descriptivestatistics. FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels in nonfastingpatients (n = 13) were compared with those from patients who fasted at least 8hours before injection (n = 12) by using nonparametric one-way analysis ofvariance with Bonferroni correction. Tumor FGln avidity versus fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) avidity in patients with paired PET scans (n = 15) was evaluated with theFisher exact test. P < .05 was considered indicative of a statisticallysignificant difference. Results FGln PET depicted tumors of different cancertypes (breast, pancreas, renal, neuroendocrine, lung, colon, lymphoma, bile duct,or glioma) in 17 of the 25 patients, predominantly clinically aggressive tumorswith genetic mutations implicated in abnormal glutamine metabolism. Acute fastinghad no significant effect on FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels.FGln-avid tumors were uniformly FDG-avid but not vice versa (P = .07). Patientsexperienced no adverse effects. Conclusion Preliminary human FGln PET trialresults provide clinical validation of abnormal glutamine metabolism as apotential tumor biomarker for targeted radiotracer imaging in several differentcancer types. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for thisarticle.

"Efficacy and safety of micafungin for the treatment of patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis: A non-comparative, multicenter, phase IV, open-label study.",/pubmed/29384927,"INTRODUCTION: Few studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of micafungin in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA). This was the aim ofthe current study, which was conducted in 22 hospitals in China, where micafunginwas approved for treatment of IA in 2006.METHODS: This was a non-comparative, phase IV open-label study (NCT02646774).Eligible patient were adults with proven or probable IA. Efficacy endpointsincluded rates of overall treatment success (primary endpoint) and clinicalimprovement, fungal clearance, mortality, and the site of Aspergillus infection(all secondary endpoints). Safety endpoints included incidences oftreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and adverse drugreactions (ADRs). These endpoints were reported descriptively with associated 95%confidence intervals (CI); no hypotheses were tested.RESULTS: The study was discontinued early due to low patient recruitment, whichdid not allow for the planned sample size to be reached. In total, 68 patientswere enrolled: 42 into the full analysis set (for efficacy) and 61 into thesafety analysis set. All patients were Han Chinese; the majority were male(n_=_26; 61.9%) and _60 years of age (n_=_35; 83.3%). Rates of overall treatment success, clinical improvement, fungal clearance, and mortality were 45.2%(n_=_19/42; 95% CI: 29.85-61.33); 59.5% (n_=_25/42; 95% CI: 43.28-74.37), 80.0%(n_=_4/5; 95% CI: 28.36-99.49), and 7.1% (n_=_3/42; 95% CI: 1.50-19.48),respectively. All patients were diagnosed with pulmonary Aspergillus infection.Overall, 155 TEAEs and 8 SAEs were reported by 37 (60.7%) and 7 (11.5%) patients.The most common TEAEs were decreased platelet count and fatigue (both n_=_5;8.2%) and the most common SAEs were intracranial hemorrhage and lung infection(n_=_3; 4.9% and n_=_2; 3.3%). Eight ADRs (n_=_6; 9.8%) were reported but allwere completely remitted or remitting during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that micafungin is efficacious and well-tolerated inpatients with proven or probable IA in China. However, these findings should beinterpreted with care, due to the small number of patients included in thisstudy. Further comparative trials should be used to confirm the efficacy andsafety of micafungin in patients with proven or probable IA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Phase I Study of Hypofractionated Carbon-ion Radiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29374716,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety ofhypofractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in patients with stage IIInon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with untreated, histologically proven,unresectable stage III NSCLC and not candidates for chemotherapy were included inthis study. C-ion RT was planned and administered with 4 Gy (relative biological effectiveness (RBE)) in daily fractions for a total dose of 64 Gy (RBE) withoutcombined chemotherapy. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as suspension of C-ion RT treatment for 2 weeks due to _ grade 2 pneumonitis, or any other _ grade3 adverse event, or as any _ grade 4 adverse event within 3 months from the startof treatment.RESULTS: Six patients were treated between June 2013 and December 2014. Theplanned full dose of C-ion RT (64 Gy (RBE)) was completed in all patients. Nopatient developed DLT, and no patient experienced toxicities of _grade 3severity. The overall response rate was 100%, and local tumor control wasachieved in all patients during the survival period.CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated C-ion RT of patients with stage III NSCLC wasfeasible and well tolerated. Although the number of patients in this study wassmall, the results support further investigations to confirm the long-termtherapeutic efficacy of this treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Household-Contact Investigation for Detection of Tuberculosis in Vietnam.,/pubmed/29342390,"BACKGROUND: Active case finding is a top priority for the global control oftuberculosis, but robust evidence for its effectiveness in high-prevalencesettings is lacking. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of household-contactinvestigation, as compared with standard, passive measures alone, in Vietnam.METHODS: We performed a cluster-randomized, controlled trial at clinics in 70districts (local government areas with an average population of approximately500,000 in urban areas and 100,000 in rural areas) in eight provinces of Vietnam.Health workers at each district clinic or hospital were assigned to performeither household-contact intervention plus standard passive case finding(intervention group) or passive case finding alone (control group). In theintervention districts, household contacts of patients with positive results for tuberculosis on sputum smear microscopy (smear-positive tuberculosis) wereinvited for clinical assessment and chest radiography at baseline and at 6, 12,and 24 months. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of registeredcases of tuberculosis among household contacts of patients with tuberculosisduring a 2-year period.RESULTS: In 70 selected districts, we enrolled 25,707 household contacts of10,964 patients who had smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. In the 36districts that were included in the intervention group, 180 of 10,069 contactswere registered as having tuberculosis (1788 cases per 100,000 population), ascompared with 110 of 15,638 contacts (703 per 100,000) in the control group(relative risk of the primary outcome in the intervention group, 2.5; 95%confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.2; P<0.001); the relative risk ofsmear-positive disease among household contacts in the intervention group was 6.4(95% CI, 4.5 to 9.0; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Household-contact investigation plus standard passive case findingwas more effective than standard passive case finding alone for the detection of tuberculosis in a high-prevalence setting at 2 years.

Phase II study of tailored S-1 monotherapy with a 1-week interval after a 2-week dosing period in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29325686,"BACKGROUND: S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine that is active in the treatment ofnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, an optimal treatment schedule andappropriate dose adjustments of S-1 in elderly patients have not yet beenestablished.METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a2-week S-1 monotherapy treatment followed by a 1-week interval as a first-linetreatment of elderly NSCLC patients, by adjusting the dose based on theindividual creatinine clearance (Ccr) and body surface area (BSA). The primaryendpoint was the disease control rate.RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. The disease control and response rateswere 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 79.8-99.2) and 7.9% (95% CI =0.0-16.4), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overallsurvival times were 4.4 months (95% CI = 4.2-8.5) and 17.0 months (95% CI =11.2-18.7), respectively.

The potential benefits from respiratory gating for breast cancer patients regarding target coverage and dose to organs at risk when applying strict dose limits to the heart: results from the DBCG HYPO trial.,/pubmed/29205080,"PURPOSE: The potential benefits from respiratory gating (RG) compared tofree-breathing (FB) regarding target coverage and dose to organs at risk forbreast cancer patients receiving post-operative radiotherapy (RT) in the DBCGHYPO multicentre trial are reported.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients included in the DBCG HYPO trial were randomizedbetween 50_Gy in 25 fractions (normofractionated) versus 40_Gy in 15 fractions(hypofractionated). A tangential forward field-in-field dose planning techniquewas used to cover the clinical target volume (CTV) with the intent to limit dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA) to 20_Gy and 17_Gy in thenormo- and hypofractionated arms, respectively. Treatment plan data for 1327patients from four Danish centres was retrospectively analyzed. FB right-sidedpatients served as control group for the left-sided patients regarding CTV V95%(relative volume receiving at least 95% of the prescribed dose), mean heart dose (MHD) and mean lung dose (MLD).RESULTS: Median CTV V95% was for FB right-sided, FB left-sided and RG left-sided patients 94.6, 92.6 and 94.7% for normofractionated therapy, respectively, and94.6, 91.8 and 94.4% for hypofractionated therapy and did not differsignificantly for RG left-sided plans compared to FB right-sided in either study arm. CTV V95% was significantly lower for FB versus RG for left-sided plans inboth arms. Median MHD was 0.7, 1.8 and 1.5_Gy (normofractionated therapy) versus 0.6, 1.5 and 1.2_Gy (hypofractionated therapy), respectively. The correspondingmedian MLD was 9.0, 8.3 and 7.3_Gy versus 7.3, 6.4 and 5.8_Gy, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: RG for left-sided breast cancer patients ensured similar CTV V95% asfor FB right-sided patients. MLD was lower for RG due to the increased lungvolume. MHD was generally low due to strict protocol-defined maximum dose toLADCA, but for left-sided patients RG led to significantly lower MHD.",RCT,,,,50_Gy in 25 fractions (normofractionated) ,40_Gy in 15 fractions (hypofractionated),,,Beast cancer patients receiving post-operative radiotherapy,CTV V95%,
Multifunctional Assessment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Perfusion-Metabolic Correlation.,/pubmed/29189372,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship betweenwhole-tumor CT perfusion and FDG PET/CT parameters in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Twenty-five patients with NSCLC were prospectively included. CTperfusion parameters calculated were blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), meantransit time, and peak enhancement intensity. SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolictumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were evaluated for PET/CT. Tumor diameter and volume were measured, and lesions were divided according tomaximum axial diameter in more than 3 cm and 3 cm or less. The correlationsbetween CT perfusion and PET/CT parameters were assessed in all tumors, as wellas according to tumor diameter and volume.RESULTS: Lesion diameter and volume showed a negative correlation with BF and BV (r = -0.78, -0.78, -0.57, -0.48, respectively) and a positive correlation withmean transit time (r = 0.55, 0.65, respectively). The negative correlationbetween BF and lesion diameter and volume was confirmed in the subgroup oflesions of more than 3 cm (r = -0.68, -0.68, respectively). A positivecorrelation between SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, and lesion volume was observed (r =0.50, 0.50, 0.46, respectively) and confirmed in lesions 3 cm or less (r = 0.81, 0.79, 0.78, respectively). Metabolic tumor volume and TLG showed a positivecorrelation with lesion diameter and volume in the overall population (r = 0.93, 0.87, 0.88, 0.90, respectively) and in lesions of more than 3 cm (r = 0.89, 0.84,0.84, 0.79, respectively). Blood flow and BV showed a negative correlation withMTV and TLG (r = -0.77, -0.74, and -0.58, -0.48, respectively) in the overallpopulation and with MTV in lesions of more than 3 cm (r = -0.69, -0.62,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Perfusion and metabolic parameters seem to depend on tumor size. Thebigger the tumor, the lower the BF and the BV and, conversely, the higher theSUVpeak, MTV, and TLG.

Bevacizumab and gefitinib enhanced whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases due to non-small-cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29185589,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who experience brain metastases areusually associated with poor prognostic outcomes. This retrospective studyproposed to assess whether bevacizumab or gefitinib can be used to improve theeffectiveness of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in managing patients with brain metastases. A total of 218 NSCLC patients with multiple brain metastases wereretrospectively included in this study and were randomly allocated tobevacizumab-gefitinib-WBRT group (n=76), gefitinib-WBRT group (n=77) and WBRTgroup (n=75). Then, tumor responses were evaluated every 2 months based onResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0. Karnofsky performancestatus and neurologic examination were documented every 6 months after thetreatment. Compared to the standard WBRT, bevacizumab and gefitinib couldsignificantly enhance response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) of WBRT(P<0.001). At the same time, RR and DCR of patients who receivedbevacizumab-gefitinib-WBRT were higher than those who received gefitinib-WBRT.The overall survival (OS) rates and progression-free survival (PFS) rates alsodiffered significantly among the bevacizumab-gefitinib-WBRT (48.6 and 29.8%),gefitinib-WBRT (36.7 and 29.6%) and WBRT (9.8 and 14.6%) groups (P<0.05).Although bevacizumab-gefitinib-WBRT was slightly more toxic than gefitinib-WBRT, the toxicity was tolerable. As suggested by prolonged PFS and OS status,bevacizumab substantially improved the overall efficacy of WBRT in the managementof patients with NSCLC.",RCT,,,,bevacizumab-gefitinib-WBRT (whole brain radiotherapy),gefitinib-WBRT (whole brain radiotherapy),WBRT (whole brain radiotherapy),,Non-small-cell lung cancer,Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0,

Effect of an Indwelling Pleural Catheter vs Talc Pleurodesis on Hospitalization Days in Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusion: The AMPLE Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29164255,"Importance: Indwelling pleural catheter and talc pleurodesis are establishedtreatments for malignant pleural effusions among patients with poor prognosis.Objective: To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters are more effectivethan talc pleurodesis in reducing total hospitalization days in the remaininglifespan of patients with malignant pleural effusion.Design, Setting, and Participants: This open-label, randomized clinical trialincluded participants recruited from 9 centers in Australia, New Zealand,Singapore, and Hong Kong between July 2012 and October 2014; they were followedup for 12 months (study end date: October 16, 2015). Patients (n_=_146) withsymptomatic malignant pleural effusion who had not undergone indwelling pleuralcatheter or pleurodesis treatment were included.Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1) to indwelling pleural catheter (n_=_74) or talc pleurodesis (n_=_72), minimized by malignancy (mesothelioma vsothers) and trapped lung (vs not), and stratified by region (Australia vs Asia).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the total number of daysspent in hospital from procedure to death or to 12 months. Secondary outcomesincluded further pleural interventions, patient-reported breathlessness,quality-of-life measures, and adverse events.Results: Among the 146 patients who were randomized (median age, 70.5 years;56.2% male), 2 withdrew before receiving the randomized intervention and wereexcluded. The indwelling pleural catheter group spent significantly fewer days inhospital than the pleurodesis group (median, 10.0 [interquartile range [IQR],3-17] vs 12.0 [IQR, 7-21] days; P_=_.03; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of difference,2.92 days; 95% CI, 0.43-5.84). The reduction was mainly in effusion-relatedhospitalization days (median, 1.0 [IQR, 1-3] day with the indwelling pleuralcatheter vs 4.0 (IQR, 3-6) days with pleurodesis; P_<_.001; Hodges-Lehmannestimate, 2.06 days; 95% CI, 1.53-2.58). Fewer patients randomized to indwelling pleural catheter required further ipsilateral invasive pleural drainages (4.1% vs22.5%; difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 7.7%-29.2%). There were no significantdifferences in improvements in breathlessness or quality of life offered byindwelling pleural catheter or talc pleurodesis. Adverse events were seen in 22patients in the indwelling pleural catheter group (30 events) and 13 patients in the pleurodesis group (18 events).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with malignant pleural effusion,treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter vs talc pleurodesis resulted infewer hospitalization days from treatment to death, but the magnitude of thedifference is of uncertain clinical importance.

Phase 1 Trial Evaluating Safety of Pulmonary Artery Sealing With Ultrasonic Energy in VATS Lobectomy.,/pubmed/29157742,"BACKGROUND: Energy-sealing devices may be useful to divide small pulmonaryarteries (PAs) during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Weevaluated the safety of PA branch sealing with an ultrasonic energyvessel-sealing device during VATS lobectomy.METHODS: The study consisted of a phase 1 trial. Patients planned to undergo VATSlobectomy were prospectively enrolled. Target sample size was 20 patients.Branches of 7 mm or less were sealed and cut with an ultrasonic energyvessel-sealing device. The remainder of the lobectomy was performed in a standardfashion. Intraoperative, in-hospital, and 30-day postoperative bleeding wereprospectively recorded.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were prospectively enrolled. Thirteen patientswere not amenable to PA sealing with the vessel-sealing device because all PAbranch diameters exceeded 7 mm (n¾= 10), conversion to thoracotomy (n¾= 2), andlobectomy not performed (n¾=¾1). A minimum of one PA branch was sealed with thedevice in 20 patients. Fifty-eight PA branches were divided in 20 patients: 31with ultrasonic device, 24 with endostaplers, 2 with clips, and 1 with sutures.The mean vessel diameter sealed with the device was 4 mm. Two patients wereconverted to thoracotomy (1 with PA injury during dissection, 1 with PA tumorinvasion). No intraoperative or postoperative bleeding was related to ultrasonic PA branch sealing. No postoperative deaths occurred.CONCLUSIONS: PA branch sealing for vessels 7 mm or less was safely achieved usingan ultrasonic energy vessel-sealing device in VATS lobectomy. Large-scale,prospective, multi-institutional studies are necessary before widespread clinicalapplication of energy for PA branch sealing in VATS lobectomy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Outcomes from ovarian cancer screening in the PLCO trial: Histologic heterogeneity impacts detection, overdiagnosis and survival.",/pubmed/29156299,"AIM: A mortality benefit from screening for ovarian cancer has never beendemonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening outcomes fordifferent histologic subtypes of ovarian cancers.METHODS: Women in the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal andOvarian¾Screening Trial underwent CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound annually for3-5 years. We compared screening test characteristics (including overdiagnosis)and outcomes by tumour type (type II versus¾other) and study arm (screeningversus¾usual care).RESULTS: Of 78,215 women randomised, 496 women were diagnosed with ovariancancer. Of the tumours that were characterised (n¾=¾413; 83%), 74% (n¾=¾305) weretype II versus 26% other (n¾=¾108). Among screened patients, 70% of tumours were type II compared to 78% in usual care (p¾=¾0.09). Within the screening arm, 29%of type II tumours were screen detected compared to 54% of the others (p¾<¾0.01).The sensitivity of screening was 65% for type II tumours versus 86% for othertypes (p¾=¾0.02). 15% of type II screen-detected tumours were stage I/II,compared to 81% of other tumours (p¾<¾0.01). The overdiagnosis rate was lower fortype II compared to other tumours (28.2% versus 72.2%; p¾<¾0.01). Ovariancancer-specific survival was worse for type II tumours compared to others(p¾<¾0.01). Survival was similar for type II (p¾=¾0.74) or other types (p¾=¾0.32)regardless of study arm.CONCLUSIONS: Test characteristics of screening for ovarian cancer differed fortype II tumours compared to other ovarian tumours.

Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29151359,"BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, irreversible epidermalgrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectivelyinhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. Wecompared osimertinib with standard EGFR-TKIs in patients with previouslyuntreated, EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 556 patientswith previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R)advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mgonce daily) or a standard EGFR-TKI (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily orerlotinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily). The primary end point wasinvestigator-assessed progression-free survival.RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was significantly longer withosimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazardratio for disease progression or death, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001). The objective response rate was similar in the two groups: 80%with osimertinib and 76% with standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P=0.24). The median duration of response was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8to 22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8) with standardEGFR-TKIs. Data on overall survival were immature at the interim analysis (25%maturity). The survival rate at 18 months was 83% (95% CI, 78 to 87) withosimertinib and 71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) with standard EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P=0.007 [nonsignificant in the interimanalysis]). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were less frequent withosimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (34% vs. 45%).CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib showed efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR-TKIsin the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC, with asimilar safety profile and lower rates of serious adverse events.

"A first-in-human phase I study of SAR125844, a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumours with MET amplification.",/pubmed/29145039,"PURPOSE: Dysregulated MET signalling is implicated in oncogenesis. The safety andpreliminary efficacy of a highly selective MET kinase inhibitor (SAR125844) wasinvestigated in patients with advanced solid tumours and MET dysregulation.METHODS: This was a phase I dose-escalation (3¾+¾3 design [50-740¾mg/m2]) anddose-expansion study. In the dose escalation, patients had high total MET (t-MET)expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or MET amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. In the dose expansion, patients had MET amplification(including a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) orphosphorylated-MET (p-MET) expression (IHC). Objectives were determination ofmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) of once-weekly intravenous SAR125844 based ondose-limiting toxicities; safety and pharmacokinetic profile; preliminaryefficacy of SAR125844 MTD in the expansion cohort.RESULTS: In total, 72 patients were enrolled: dose escalation, N¾=¾33; doseexpansion, N¾=¾39; 570¾mg/m2 was established as the MTD. Most frequenttreatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were asthenia/fatigue (58.3%), nausea(31.9%), and abdominal pain, constipation, and dyspnea (27.8% for each); 58.3% ofpatients reported grade 3 AEs (19.4% were treatment related). Of the 29 evaluablepatients with MET amplification treated at 570¾mg/m2, five achieved a partialresponse, including four of 22 with NSCLC; 17 patients had stable disease. Noresponse was observed in patients with high p-MET solid tumours. There was nocorrelation between tumour response and t-MET status or MET gene copy number.CONCLUSION: The MTD of once-weekly SAR125844 was 570¾mg/m2; SAR125844 was welltolerated, with significant antitumour activity in patients with MET-amplifiedNSCLC.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01391533.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reducing Symptom Distress in Patients With Advanced Cancer Using an e-Alert System for Caregivers: Pooled Analysis of Two Randomized Clinical Trials.,/pubmed/29138131,"BACKGROUND: Symptom distress in patients toward the end of life can changerapidly. Family caregivers have the potential to help patients manage thosesymptoms, as well as their own stress, if they are equipped with the properresources. Electronic health (eHealth) systems may be able to provide thoseresources. Very sick patients may not be able to use such systems themselves toreport their symptoms but family caregivers could.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to assess the effects on cancer patientsymptom distress of an eHealth system that alerts clinicians to significantchanges in the patient's symptoms, as reported by a family caregiver.METHODS: A pooled analysis from two randomized clinical trials (NCT00214162 andNCT00365963) compared outcomes at 12 months for two unblinded groups: a controlgroup (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]-Only) that gavecaregivers access to CHESS, an online support system, and an experimental group(CHESS+CR [Clinician Report]), which also had CHESS but with a CR thatautomatically alerted clinicians if symptoms exceeded a predetermined thresholdof severity. Participants were dyads (n=235) of patients with advanced lung,breast, or prostate cancer and their respective family caregivers from 5 oncologyclinics in the United States of America. The proportion of improved patientthreshold symptoms was compared between groups using area-under-the-curveanalysis and binomial proportion tests. The proportion of threshold symptoms out of all reported symptoms was also examined.RESULTS: When severe caregiver-reported symptoms were shared with clinicians, thesymptoms were more likely to be subsequently reported as improved than when thesymptoms were not shared with clinicians (P<.001). Fewer symptom reports werecompleted in the group of caregivers whose reports went to clinicians than in theCHESS-Only group (P<.001), perhaps because caregivers, knowing their reportsmight be sent to a doctor, feared they might be bothering the clinician.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that an eHealth system designed for caregiversthat alerts clinicians to worrisome changes in patient health status may lead to reduced patient distress.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00214162;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00214162 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6nmgdGfuD) and Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00365963;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365963 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6nmh0U8VP).",RCT,,,,Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]+CR [Clinician Report],Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS],,,cancer patient,"The proportion of improved patientthreshold symptoms",
"Safety and tolerability of selumetinib as a monotherapy, or in combination with docetaxel as second-line therapy, in Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies or non-small cell lung cancer.",/pubmed/29136201,"Objective: This Phase I study (NCT01605916) investigated the safety, tolerabilityand pharmacokinetic profile of selumetinib plus docetaxel as second-line therapy in Japanese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), or selumetinib monotherapy in Japanese patients with advancedsolid malignancies.Methods: All enrolled patients received single-dose selumetinib 25, 50 or 75 mg, followed by a 3-day washout. Combination therapy cohorts then started a 21-daycycle of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 plus selumetinib 25 or 75 mg twice-daily (BID) on Day1. Thereafter, selumetinib BID continued for 20 days; patients received _6cycles. Following single-dosing, monotherapy cohorts underwent a 21-day cycle of selumetinib 25, 50 or 75 mg BID.Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled and 25 assigned to treatment(combination, n = 8; monotherapy, n = 17). Most frequent adverse events (AEs)included: vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea and stomatitis(combination cohorts); gastrointestinal disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissuedisorders (monotherapy cohorts). Grade 3 dose-limiting toxicities: febrileneutropenia, causally related to combination therapy (n = 3); pneumonitis,selumetinib 50 mg monotherapy (n = 1).

"Adjuvant chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer (E1505): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial.",/pubmed/29129443,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected early-stage non-small-cell lungcancer (NSCLC) provides a modest survival benefit. Bevacizumab, a monoclonalantibody directed against VEGF, improves outcomes when added to platinum-basedchemotherapy in advanced-stage non-squamous NSCLC. We aimed to evaluate theaddition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage resected NSCLC.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial of adult patients (aged _18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and who had completely resected stage IB (_4 cm) to IIIA (defined by theAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer 6th edition) NSCLC. We enrolled patients from across the US National Clinical Trials Network, including patients from theEastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) affiliates in Europe and from the Canadian Cancer Trials Group,within 6-12 weeks of surgery. The chemotherapy regimen for each patient wasselected before randomisation and administered intravenously; it consisted offour 21-day cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1 in all regimens) incombination with investigator's choice of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8),docetaxel (75 mg/m2 on day 1), gemcitabine (1200 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8), orpemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on day 1). Patients in the bevacizumab group receivedbevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days starting with cycle 1 ofchemotherapy and continuing for 1 year. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) togroup A (chemotherapy alone) or group B (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab),centrally, using permuted blocks sizes and stratified by chemotherapy regimen,stage of disease, histology, and sex. No one was masked to treatment assignment, except the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. The primary endpoint was overallsurvival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00324805.FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2007, and Sept 20, 2013, 1501 patients were enrolledand randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 749 to group A (chemotherapyalone) and 752 to group B (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab). 383 (26%) of 1458patients (with complete staging information) had stage IB, 636 (44%) had stageII, and 439 (30%) had stage IIIA disease (stage of disease data were missing for 43 patients). Squamous cell histology was reported for 422 (28%) of 1501patients. All four cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens were used: 377 (25%)patients received vinorelbine, 343 (23%) received docetaxel, 283 (19%) receivedgemcitabine, and 497 (33%) received pemetrexed. At a median follow-up of 50à3months (IQR 32à9-68à0), the estimated median overall survival in group A has not been reached, and in group B was 85à8 months (95% CI 74à9 to not reached); hazardratio (group B vs group A) 0à99 (95% CI 0à82-1à19; p=0à90). Grade 3-5 toxicities of note (all attributions) that were reported more frequently in group B (thebevacizumab group) than in group A (chemotherapy alone) were overall worst grade (ie, all grade 3-5 toxicities; 496 [67%] of 738 in group A vs 610 [83%] of 735 ingroup B), hypertension (60 [8%] vs 219 [30%]), and neutropenia (241 [33%] vs 275 [37%]). The number of deaths on treatment did not differ between the groups (15deaths in group A vs 19 in group B).

Here we report the prespecified exploratory endpoint ofpembrolizumab versus chemotherapy on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).METHODS: In this multicentre, international, randomised, open-label, phase 3trial, we recruited patients with treatment-naive, stage IV NSCLC in 102 sites in16 countries. Eligible patients had measurable disease (per RECIST version 1.1)and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response systemand integrated web response system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3weeks (35 cycles) or investigator-choice platinum-doublet chemotherapy (4-6cycles or until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).Randomisation was stratified according to geography, ECOG performance status, andhistology. PROs were assessed at day 1 of cycles 1-3, every 9 weeks thereafter,at the treatment discontinuation visit, and at the 30-day safety assessment visitusing the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (QLQ-C30), the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 items (QLQ-LC13), and the European Quality of Life 5Dimensions-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. The key exploratory PRO endpoints(analysed for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and completed at least one PRO instrument at at least one timepoint) werebaseline-to-week-15 change in the QLQ-C30 global health status(GHS)/quality-of-life (QOL) score and time to deterioration of the composite ofcough, chest pain, and dyspnoea in the QLQ-LC13.

Three patients in eachgroup did not complete any PRO instruments at any timepoints, and so 299 patientswere included in the full analysis set. Of these patients, one in each group did not complete any PRO instruments before week 15, and so were not included inanalyses of change from baseline to week 15. PRO compliance was greater than 90% at baseline and approximately 80% at week 15 for both groups. Least-squares mean baseline-to-week-15 change in QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL score was 6à9 (95% CI 3à3 to 10à6) for pembrolizumab and -0à9 (-4à8 to 3à0) for chemotherapy, for a difference of7à8 (2à9 to 12à8; two-sided nominal p=0à0020).

Weekly cabazitaxel plus prednisone is effective and less toxic for 'unfit' metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Phase II Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Group (SOGUG) trial.,/pubmed/29102858,"AIM: Cabazitaxel (CBZ), a novel tubulin-binding taxane, improves overall survivalin metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that progresses duringor after docetaxel treatment. We have designed a phase II study to evaluate theefficacy and safety of CBZ as a weekly schedule for 'unfit' mCRPC patients after docetaxel failure.METHODS: In this single arm phase II study. CBZ was weekly administered in 1-hourinfusion on days 1, 8, 15¾and 22, every 5¾weeks at 10¾mg/m2 to eligible 'unfit'patients; oral prednisone (5¾mg) was administered twice a day. Circulating tumourcells (CTCs) were also collected. New treatment scheme was considered effectiveif at least 65% of patients met a clinical benefit criteria based onprostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS) values at week12.RESULTS: Seventy patients (median age: 73.9 years) were enrolled; overall, 71.4% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) of 2; and 84%, 16%¾and 11% had bone, liver¾and lung metastases, respectively. Objectivepartial response or stable disease was achieved in 61% of patients, while PSAresponses of _50% and _80% were observed in 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Themedian PSA-PFS was 4.8 months; and 68.6% of patients had no progression at week12. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (2.8%), leukopenia(5.7%)¾and thrombocytopaenia (9%); no cases of febrile neutropenia were reported.Early CTC response was significantly correlated with PSA-PFS.CONCLUSIONS: CBZ/prednisone administered weekly to 'unfit' mCRPC patients appearsto be as effective as classical standard 3-week scheme (TROPIC study)¾but withsignificantly lower toxicities and better tolerance. Early CTC response appearsto be valuable as an early end-point of therapeutic efficacy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Phase II Toxicity End Point Trial (ICORG 99-09) of Accelerated Dose-escalated Hypofractionated Radiation in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29097074,"AIMS: The objective of this phase II clinical trial was to prospectively evaluatethe safety and efficacy of accelerated hypofractionated three-dimensionalconformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in localised non-resectable/non-operablenon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with stage I-III NSCLC were enrolled in aprospective single-arm All Ireland Co-operative Oncology Research Group (ICORG99-09) toxicity end point phase II trial. The protocol allocated patients betweenthree radiation schedule dose levels (60, 66 or 72 Gy, in 20, 22 and 24fractions, respectively, 3 Gy daily, five fractions per week) according tocombined lung V25Gy (V25Gy¾_¾30%) with built-in early stopping toxicity rules.The primary end point was toxicity with evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity. Thesecondary objectives included radiological tumour response rate at 3 months afterthe completion of radiation therapy and the thoracic progression-free survivaltime.RESULTS: Sixty patients were recruited from August 1999 to June 2009. Forty-nine patients were included in the primary per-protocol analysis. Eleven patients werenot evaluable. In the first 30 evaluable patient cohort, severe oesophagealtoxicity was reported in two patients (2/49; 4% experiencing grade 5 oesophageal late toxicity, related to the 97% oesophageal length). The trial was temporarily closed and was then reopened to validate an oesophageal dose volume constraint(DVC) of limiting the length of oesophagus fully encompassed by the 97% isodoseto less than 1 cm (applied to 21 patients). The trial prospectively showed thesafety of the oesophageal DVC, with no oesophageal toxicity above grade 3thereafter. Thirty-nine per cent of patients had disease progression at 3-4months after radiotherapy, 22% had stable disease, 20% had a complete responseand 14% had a partial response. The median overall survival was 13.6 months (95% confidence interval 10.5-16.7) and overall survival at 1 and 3 years was 57% and 29%, respectively.CONCLUSION: A strategy using accelerated hypofractionated 3DCRT is feasible andreasonably safe for patients with inoperable NSCLC. It is safe to deliver forcentrally located tumours if DVCs are applied to the oesophagus, which is theprimary dose-limiting toxicity. Further studies are required to assess theefficacy of hypofractionated regimens for centrally located tumours using anoesophageal DVC and monitoring for oesophageal toxicity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Correlation Between Tumor Necrosis Factor-± and Interleukin-1_ in Exhaled Breath Condensate and Pulmonary Function.,/pubmed/29078843,"BACKGROUND: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has emerged as a noninvasive methodfor assessing inflammation in lung diseases. Our aim is to investigate thecorrelation between tumor necrosis factor _ (TNF-_) and interleukin 1_ (IL-1_) inEBC and in lung tissue, and between these values in EBC with pulmonary functiontests in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: To ensure the availability of lung tissue, 60 patientsundergoing resection for early lung cancer were divided into 3 groups: a COPDtreatment group, a COPD control group and a non-COPD group. Patients in the COPD treatment group received what was termed ""lung-protective treatment"" includingambroxol, budesonide and ipratropium bromide in addition to chest physiotherapy. Patients underwent pulmonary function testing and EBC collection, and TNF-_ andIL-1_ were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TNF-_ and IL-1_in lung tissues were evaluated by immunoflorescense. Correlations were analyzedby Pearson correlation coefficients.RESULTS: The TNF-_ and IL-1_ levels in EBC were significantly higher in the COPD groups compared with the non-COPD group before surgery (all P < 0.01), and thelevels were significantly decreased after lung-protective treatment was received before surgery (all P < 0.01). TNF-_ and IL-1_ levels in EBC were significantlydecreased in all patients after surgery with lung-protective treatment (P =0.027, P = 0.004). TNF-_ and IL-1_ content in lung tissues was significantlyhigher in the COPD groups (all P < 0.05), and the histologic analysis showedsimilar results. Negative correlations between FEV1/FVC and expression of TNF-_and IL-1_ were observed. There was a positive correlation between TNF-_ and IL-1_in lung tissues and in EBC.CONCLUSIONS: TNF-_ and IL-1_ in EBC are potential biomarkers for evaluatingpulmonary function and inflammation in patients with COPD. Furthermore,lung-protective treatment is effective in reducing inflammation in patients with COPD.",N,,,,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment group,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease control group,Non chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group,,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,TNF-_ and IL-1_ levels in exhaled breath condensate,

At each centre, the investigator or their designeeregistered each patient using an interactive voice recognition system into one ofthe three treatment groups. The randomisation allocation sequence was generatedby an external company; patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receivetreatment with long-acting pasireotide (60 mg intramuscularly every 28 days),everolimus (10 mg orally once daily), or both in combination, for the core12-month treatment period. Patients were stratified by carcinoid type (typical vsatypical) and line of study treatment (first line vs others). The primaryendpoint was the proportion of patients progression-free at month 9, defined asthe proportion of patients with overall lesion assessment at month 9 showing acomplete response, partial response, or stable disease according to localResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, assessed in theintention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who receivedat least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safetyassessment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01563354. The extension phase of the study is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between Aug 16, 2013, and Sept 30, 2014, 124 patients were enrolledfrom 36 centres in nine countries: 41 were allocated to the long-actingpasireotide group, 42 to the everolimus group, and 41 to the combination group.At month 9, the proportion of patients with an overall lesion assessment ofcomplete response, partial response, or stable disease was 16 of 41 patients(39à0%, 95% CI 24à2-55à5) in the long-acting pasireotide group, 14 of 42 patients(33à3%, 19à6-49à5) in the everolimus group, and 24 of 41 patients (58à5%,42à1-73à7) in the combination group. The most common grade 1-2 adverse eventswith a suspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy werediarrhoea (15 [37%] of 41), hyperglycaemia (17 [41%]), and weight loss (8 [20%]);those with a suspected association with everolimus monotherapy were stomatitis(26 [62%] of 42) and diarrhoea (16 [38%]); and those suspected to be associatedwith combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (27 [66%] of 41]), diarrhoea (19[46%]), and asthenia (8 [20%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with asuspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy were_-glutamyltransferase increased (four [10%] of 41 patients), diarrhoea (three[7%]), and hyperglycaemia (three [7%]); those for everolimus were hyperglycaemia (seven [17%] of 42 patients), stomatitis (four [10%]), and diarrhoea (three[7%]); those for combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (nine [22%] of 41patients) and diarrhoea (four [10%]). 11 patients died during the core 12-monthtreatment phase or up to 56 days after the last study treatment exposure date:two (5%) of 41 in the long-acting pasireotide group, six (14%) of 42 in theeverolimus group, and three (7%) of 41 in the combination group. No deaths weresuspected to be related to long-acting pasireotide treatment. One death in theeverolimus group (acute kidney injury associated with diarrhoea), and two deaths in the combination group (diarrhoea and urinary sepsis in one patient, and acute renal failure and respiratory failure in one patient) were suspected to berelated to everolimus treatment. In the latter patient, acute renal failure wasnot suspected to be related to everolimus treatment, but respiratory failure was suspected to be related.INTERPRETATION: The study met the primary endpoint in all three treatment groups.Safety profiles were consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents.Further studies are needed to confirm the antitumour efficacy of the combination of a somatostatin analogue with everolimus in lung and thymic carcinoids.FUNDING: Novartis Pharma AG.",RCT,,,,long-acting pasireotide,everolimus,combination,,lung and thymic carcinoids,proportion of patients progression-free at month 9,
"Lorlatinib in non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK or ROS1 rearrangement: an international, multicentre, open-label, single-arm first-in-man phase 1 trial.",/pubmed/29074098,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged or ROSproto-oncogene 1 (ROS1)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) aresensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, but resistance invariablydevelops, commonly within the CNS. This study aimed to analyse the safety,efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of lorlatinib, a novel, highly potent,selective, and brain-penetrant ALK and ROS1 TKI with preclinical activity againstmost known resistance mutations, in patients with advanced ALK-positive orROS1-positive NSCLC.METHODS: In this international multicentre, open-label, single-arm, first-in-man phase 1 dose-escalation study, eligible patients had advanced ALK-positive orROS1-positive NSCLC and were older than 18 years, with an Eastern CooperativeOncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate end-organ function.Lorlatinib was administered orally to patients at doses ranging from 10 mg to 200mg once daily or 35 mg to 100 mg twice daily, with a minimum of three patientsreceiving each dose. For some patients, tumour biopsy was done before lorlatinib treatment to identify ALK resistance mutations. Safety was assessed in patientswho received at least one dose of lorlatinib; efficacy was assessed in theintention-to-treat population (patients who received at least one dose of studytreatment and had either ALK or ROS1 rearrangement). The primary endpoint wasdose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 according to investigator assessment;secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, and overall response. Thisstudy is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01970865.FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2014, and July 10, 2015, 54 patients received at least one dose of lorlatinib, including 41 (77%) with ALK-positive and 12 (23%) withROS1-positive NSCLC; one patient had unconfirmed ALK and ROS1 status. 28 (52%)patients had received two or more TKIs, and 39 (72%) patients had CNS metastases.The most common treatment-related adverse events among the 54 patients werehypercholesterolaemia (39 [72%] of 54 patients), hypertriglyceridaemia (21 [39%] of 54 patients), peripheral neuropathy (21 [39%] of 54 patients), and peripheral oedema (21 [39%] of 54 patients). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 200 mg(the patient did not take at least 16 of 21 prescribed total daily doses in cycle1 because of toxicities attributable to study drug, which were grade 2neurocognitive adverse events comprising slowed speech and mentation andword-finding difficulty). No maximum tolerated dose was identified. Therecommended phase 2 dose was selected as 100 mg once daily. For ALK-positivepatients, the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 19(46%) of 41 patients (95% CI 31-63); for those who had received two or more TKIs,the proportion of patients with an objective response was 11 (42%) of 26 patients(23-63). In ROS1-positive patients, including seven crizotinib-pretreatedpatients, an objective response was achieved by six (50%) of 12 patients (95% CI 21-79).INTERPRETATION: In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, lorlatinib showed bothsystemic and intracranial activity in patients with advanced ALK-positive orROS1-positive NSCLC, most of whom had CNS metastases and had previously had twoor more TKI treatments fail. Therefore, lorlatinib might be an effectivetherapeutic strategy for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have becomeresistant to currently available TKIs, including second-generation ALK TKIs, and is being investigated in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial comparinglorlatinib to crizotinib (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03052608).FUNDING: Pfizer.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Technical Note: Correction for the effect of breathing variations in CT pulmonary ventilation imaging.,/pubmed/29072320,"PURPOSE: The accuracy and precision of computed tomography (CT) pulmonaryventilation imaging with conventional CT scanners are limited by breathingvariations. We propose a method to correct for the effect of breathing variationsin CT ventilation imaging based on external respiratory signals acquiredthroughout a scan.METHODS: The proposed method is based on: (a) calculating voxel-by-voxelabdominal surface motion ranges using four-dimensional (4D) CT image datasetsspatiotemporally correlated with external respiratory monitor data, and (b)applying the correction factor, which is defined as the ratio of the overall meanof the abdominal surface motion range in the lungs to that of each voxel, to the CT ventilation value. The performance of the proposed method was investigated by comparing voxel-wise correlations of the uncorrected and corrected CT ventilationimages with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) ventilation images as a groundtruth for nine patients. CT ventilation images were calculated by deformableimage registration of the 4D-CT image datasets, followed by calculation ofregional volume changes. A Steiger's Z-test was used to determine the statisticalsignificance of the difference between the correlations for the uncorrected andcorrected CT ventilation images.RESULTS: The proposed correction method resulted in significant increases (P <0.05) in the correlation between CT and SPECT ventilation in three patients,trends toward significant increase (P: 0.13-0.18) in two patients, no significantdifferences in three patients, and a significantly decreased correlation in onepatient. The average standard deviation of the abdominal surface motion range in three patients showing significant increases was 0.27 (range 0.10-0.37), whichwas greater than 0.17 (range 0.07-0.38) in the other six patients.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method to correct for the effect of breathingvariations could be readily implemented and has the potential to improve theaccuracy of CT ventilation imaging as demonstrated in a nine-patient study.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Efficacy and safety of amrubicin-based regimen used as first-line for extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,/pubmed/29071806,"BACKGROUND: Currently, amrubicin is used as first-line in the treatment ofpatients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, the effect ofamrubicin-based treatment in extensive-disease (ED) SCLC remains controversial.Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) toassess the efficacy and safety of amrubicin-based regimen in the treatment ofpatients with ED-SCLC.METHODS: RCTs published in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.govwere systematically reviewed. Eligible studies were these that evaluated theefficacy and safety profiles of amrubicin-based regimen in ED-SCLC. Outcomesincluded progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall responserate (ORR), and adverse events. Results were expressed with hazard ratio (HR)with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs.RESULTS: Four RCTs involving a total of 740 patients met the inclusion criteriaand were included in this meta-analysis. Amrubicin-based regimen was notassociated with significantly prolonged PFS (HR¾=¾1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.30;P¾=¾0.463) and OS (HR¾=¾1.07, 95% CI: 0.89-1.29; P¾=¾0.443) in patients withED-SCLC. However, it significantly improved ORR (RR¾=¾1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25;P¾=¾0.008). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that neither amrubicin alone nor incombination with cisplatin prolonged the PFS and OS, and only the combinationtherapy significantly increased ORR. The incidence of grade _3 adverse events wascomparable between amrubicin-containing and other treatment groups (RR¾=¾1.42,95% CI: 0.78-2.58; P¾=¾0.248). However, amrubicin-based treatment induced asignificantly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia (RR¾=¾3.32, 95% CI:2.04-5.41; P¾<¾0.001), anemia (RR¾=¾1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.97; P¾=¾0.022),leukopenia (RR¾=¾2.17, 95% CI: 1.41-3.33; P¾<¾0.001), neutropenia (RR¾=¾1.33, 95%CI: 1.04-1.70; P¾=¾0.021), and interstitial lung disease (RR¾=¾1.58, 95% CI:1.21-1.98; P¾<¾0.001).CONCLUSION: Amrubicin-based regimen used as first-line had no survival benefitsin patients with ED-SCLC. But it significantly improved ORR. Furtherwell-conducted, large-scale trials are needed to validate these findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase improves pulmonary arterial hypertension in genetically susceptible patients.,/pubmed/29070699,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease with ahigh mortality rate. It is characterized by an occlusive vascular remodeling due to a pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic environment in the wall of resistancepulmonary arteries (PAs). Proliferating cells exhibit a cancer-like metabolicswitch where mitochondrial glucose oxidation is suppressed, whereas glycolysis isup-regulated as the major source of adenosine triphosphate production. Thismultifactorial mitochondrial suppression leads to inhibition of apoptosis anddownstream signaling promoting proliferation. We report an increase in pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase (PDK), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvatedehydrogenase (PDH, the gatekeeping enzyme of glucose oxidation) in the PAs ofhuman PAH compared to healthy lungs. Treatment of explanted human PAH lungs with the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) ex vivo activated PDH and increasedmitochondrial respiration. In a 4-month, open-label study, DCA (3 to 6.25 mg/kgb.i.d.) administered to patients with idiopathic PAH (iPAH) already on approvediPAH therapies led to reduction in mean PA pressure and pulmonary vascularresistance and improvement in functional capacity, but with a range of individualresponses. Lack of ex vivo and clinical response was associated with the presenceof functional variants of SIRT3 and UCP2 that predict reduced protein function.Impaired function of these proteins causes PDK-independent mitochondrialsuppression and pulmonary hypertension in mice. This first-in-human trial of amitochondria-targeting drug in iPAH demonstrates that PDK is a druggable targetand offers hemodynamic improvement in genetically susceptible patients, pavingthe way for novel precision medicine approaches in this disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Differences in Normal Tissue Response in the Esophagus Between Proton and Photon Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using In_Vivo Imaging Biomarkers.,/pubmed/29063837,"PURPOSE: To determine whether there exists any significant difference in normaltissue toxicity between intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or protontherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 134 study patients (n=49 treated with protontherapy, n=85 with IMRT) treated in a randomized trial had a previously validatedesophageal toxicity imaging biomarker, esophageal expansion, quantified duringradiation therapy, as well as esophagitis grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0), on a weekly basis during treatment. Differencesbetween the 2 modalities were statically analyzed using the imaging biomarkermetric value (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance), as well as the incidence and severity of esophagitis grade (_2 and Fisher exact tests, respectively). Thedose-response of the imaging biomarker was also compared between modalities usingesophageal equivalent uniform dose, as well as delivered dose to an isotropicesophageal subvolume.RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the distribution ofesophagitis grade, the incidence of grade _3 esophagitis (15 and 11 patientstreated with IMRT and proton therapy, respectively), or the esophageal expansion imaging biomarker between cohorts (P>.05) was found. The distribution of imaging biomarker metric values had similar distributions between treatment arms, despitea slightly higher dose volume in the proton arm (P>.05). Imaging biomarkerdose-response was similar between modalities for dose quantified as esophagealequivalent uniform dose and delivered esophageal subvolume dose. Regardless oftreatment modality, there was high variability in imaging biomarker response, as well as esophagitis grade, for similar esophageal doses between patients.CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in esophageal toxicity fromeither proton- or photon-based radiation therapy as quantified by esophagitisgrade or the esophageal expansion imaging biomarker.",RCT,,,,intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT),proton therapy,,,non-small cell lung cancer,imaging biomarker metric value,
Using a genetic/clinical risk score to stop smoking (GeTSS): randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/29061161,"BACKGROUND: As genetic tests become cheaper, the possibility of their widespread availability must be considered. This study involves a risk score for lung cancerin smokers that is roughly 50% genetic (50% clinical criteria). The risk scorehas been shown to be effective as a smoking cessation motivator in hospitalrecruited subjects (not actively seeking cessation services).METHODS: This was an RCT set in a United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS)smoking cessation clinic. Smokers were identified from medical records. Subjects that wanted to participate were randomised to a test group that was administered a gene-based risk test and given a lung cancer risk score, or a control groupwhere no risk score was performed. Each group had 8¾weeks of weekly smokingcessation sessions involving group therapy and advice on smoking cessationpharmacotherapy and follow-up at 6¾months. The primary endpoint was smokingcessation at 6¾months. Secondary outcomes included ranking of the risk score and other motivators.RESULTS: 67 subjects attended the smoking cessation clinic. The 6¾months quitrates were 29.4%, (10/34; 95% CI 14.1-44.7%) for the test group and 42.9% (12/28;95% CI 24.6-61.2%) for the controls. The difference is not significant. However, the quit rate for test group subjects with a ""very high"" risk score was 89% (8/9;95% CI 68.4-100%) which was significant when compared with the control group(p¾=¾0.023) and test group subjects with moderate risk scores had a 9.5% quitrate (2/21; 95% CI 2.7-28.9%) which was significantly lower than for abovemoderate risk score 61.5% (8/13; 95% CI 35.5-82.3; p¾=¾0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Only the sub-group with the highest risk score showed an increasedquit rate.

Phase II randomised discontinuation trial of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumours.,/pubmed/29059635,"BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, includingMET,¾vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, AXL¾and RET. This multi-cohort phase II randomised discontinuation trial¾explored anticancer activity ofcabozantinib in nine tumour types.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cabozantinib was administered (100¾mg, once daily) topatients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancers. Those with stabledisease at week 12 were randomised 1:1 to cabozantinib or placebo. Primaryend-points were objective response rate (ORR) at week 12 and progression-freesurvival (PFS) in the randomised phase.RESULTS: A total of 526 patients were enrolled. The highest ORR was observed inovarian cancer (OC) (21.7%); the largest PFS benefit was observed incastration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (median 5.5 versus 1.4 months forplacebo; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.52). Disease controlrates were >40% for CRPC, OC, melanoma, metastatic breast cancer (MBC),hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer. Median duration ofresponse ranged from 3.3 (MBC) to 11.2 months (OC).

The efficacy of the Kampo medicine rikkunshito for chemotherapy-induced anorexia (RICH trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/29047408,"BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a key drug in lung cancer therapy. However, cisplatin isalso well known to induce gastrointestinal disorders, such aschemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Thesesymptoms sometimes affect patients' quality of life and make continuation ofchemotherapy difficult. Anorexia is a cause of concern for patients with cancerbecause a persistent loss of appetite progresses to cancer cachexia. Althoughevidence-based management for chemotherapy has recently been established, thereis room for improvement.METHODS/DESIGN: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial will aim to determine the efficacy of the traditional Japanese Kampo medicine rikkunshito (TJ-43) for preventing anorexia caused by cisplatin-including chemotherapy inpatients with lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer who plan to receivecisplatin-including chemotherapy will be recruited. Patients who provide written consent will be randomly allocated to receive either TJ-43 (arm A) or placebo(arm B) for one course of chemotherapy (21 or 28 consecutive days). Investigatorsand patients will be masked to the treatment assignment throughout the trial.

Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; RECIST 1.1); statistical analyses compared each selumetinib group with PBO_+_DOC 75 for KRAS wild-type and overall (KRAS mutant or wild-type)populations.Results: A total of 212 patients were randomized; 69% were KRAS wild-type. There were no statistically significant improvements in PFS or overall survival foroverall or KRAS wild-type populations in either selumetinib group compared withPBO_+_DOC 75. Overall population median PFS for SEL_+_DOC 60, SEL_+_DOC 75compared with PBO_+_DOC 75 was 3.0, 4.2, and 4.3_months, HRs: 1.12 (90% CI: 0.8, 1.61) and 0.92 (90% CI: 0.65, 1.31), respectively. In the overall population, ahigher objective response rate (ORR; investigator assessed) was observed forSEL_+_DOC 75 (33%) compared with PBO_+_DOC 75 (14%); odds ratio: 3.26 (90% CI:1.47, 7.95). Overall the tolerability profile of SEL_+_DOC was consistent withhistorical data, without new or unexpected safety concerns identified.Conclusion: The primary end point (PFS) was not met. The higher ORR withSEL_+_DOC 75 did not translate into prolonged PFS for the overall or KRASwild-type patient populations. No clinical benefit was observed with SEL_+_DOC inKRAS wild-type patients compared with docetaxel alone. No unexpected safetyconcerns were reported.Trial identifier: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01750281.",RCT,,,,selumetinib plus docetaxel,placebo plus docetaxel,,,advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,progression-free survival,
A single-arm phase II study of nab-paclitaxel for patients with chemorefractory non-small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29037236,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel inpatients with refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed previous chemotherapy.METHODS: Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status of 0-2 and adequate organ function. Patients receivednab-paclitaxel, 100¾mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4¾weeks. The primaryendpoint was the overall response rate. Secondary endpoints were theprogression-free survival time, overall survival, and the toxicity profile.RESULTS: From July 2013 to July 2015, a total of 31 patients were enrolled.Fourteen patients received nab-paclitaxel as a second-line and 17 received it as an over third-line therapy. Each patient received a median of 5 treatment cycles (range, 1-11). The overall response rate was 19.3% (95% confidence interval,9.1-36.2%) (complete response (n_=_0), partial response (n_=_6), stable disease(n_=_17), and progressive disease (n_=_8)). The median progression-free survival time was 4.5¾months (95% confidence interval 3.5-6.3¾months), median overallsurvival time was 15.7¾months, and 1-year survival rate was 54.8%. Most commongrade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities were elevated aspartate transaminaselevel (3.2%) and sensory neuropathy (9.6%). Neutropenia was the most common grade3 or 4 adverse events (38.6%), and febrile neutropenia developed in 12.9%patients. No treatment-related deaths were observed in this study.CONCLUSION: Primary endpoint was met.

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals a distinct transcriptome signature of aneuploid hematopoietic cells.,/pubmed/29030335,"Cancer cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. Specific cytogeneticaberrations often are predictors of outcome, especially in hematologic neoplasms,such as monosomy 7 in myeloid malignancies. The functional consequences ofaneuploidy at the cellular level are difficult to assess because of a lack ofconvenient markers to distinguish abnormal from diploid cells. We performedsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study hematopoietic stem and progenitorcells from the bone marrow of 4 healthy donors and 5 patients with bone marrowfailure and chromosome gain or loss. In total, transcriptome sequences wereobtained from 391 control cells and 588 cells from patients. We characterizednormal hematopoiesis as binary differentiation from stem cells to erythroid andmyeloid-lymphoid pathways. Aneuploid cells were distinguished from diploid cells in patient samples by computational analyses of read fractions and geneexpression of individual chromosomes. We confirmed assignment of aneuploidy toindividual cells quantitatively, by copy-number variation, and qualitatively, by loss of heterozygosity. When we projected patients' single cells onto the map of normal hematopoiesis, diverse patterns were observed, broadly reflecting clinicalphenotypes. Patients' monosomy 7 cells showed downregulation of genes involved inimmune response and DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways, which maycontribute to the clonal expansion of monosomy 7 cells with accumulated genemutations. scRNA-seq is a powerful technique through which to infer thefunctional consequences of chromosome gain and loss and explore gene targets for directed therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Heterogeneity in Treatment Response of Spine Metastases to Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery Within ""Radiosensitive"" Subtypes.",/pubmed/29029886,"PURPOSE: To characterize outcomes of metastatic colorectal and non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC) histologies, compared with other radiosensitive histologies, treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery with regard to local control,overall survival, and predictors of response.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 127 patients with 148 spine stereotacticradiosurgery-treated metastatic lesions at our institution between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed. We assessed clinical endpoints in relation to histologic type,including local control (LC) and overall survival (OS), using univariate andmultivariate analyses.RESULTS: For all patients, the 1- and 2-year actuarial rates for LC were 82.6%and 75.8%, and rates for OS were 72.9% and 51.5% respectively. Among tumorhistologies, 1-year cumulative incidence rates of local failure for thyroid,breast, lung, and colon cancer were 8.7%, 7.0%, 26.6%, and 39.6%, respectively.When analyzed together, NSCLC and colorectal cancers had significantly greatercumulative incidence rates at 1 and 2¾years (30.4% and 38.7%, respectively) than other histologies (8.0% and 14.1% respectively, P=.0008). Non-small cell lungcancer/colorectal tumor status was a significant predictor of local failure in a competing risk univariate model (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval1.07-4.17, P=.03) and multivariate model (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidenceinterval 1.12-4.92, P=.024).CONCLUSIONS: Spine stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective strategy inachieving local control of spine metastases, particularly among radiosensitivehistologies. However, a subset of these classically defined histologies (NSCLCand colorectal) has a propensity toward local failure. In addition to resultingin poorer OS outcomes, the poor LC rates seen in NSCLC and colorectal cancers in this study are more consistent with a radioresistant phenotype, suggesting theneed for optimized dosing regimens in this subgroup.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We report updatedresults, including a pooled analysis of the two studies. Methods Patients withstage IIIB/IV squamous (N = 272) or nonsquamous (N = 582) NSCLC and diseaseprogression during or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomlyassigned 1:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). Minimum follow-up for survival was 24.2 months. Results Two-year overall survival rates with nivolumab versus docetaxel were 23% (95% CI, 16% to 30%)versus 8% (95% CI, 4% to 13%) in squamous NSCLC and 29% (95% CI, 24% to 34%)versus 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) in nonsquamous NSCLC; relative reductions in the risk of death with nivolumab versus docetaxel remained similar to those reported in the primary analyses. Durable responses were observed with nivolumab; 10 (37%)of 27 confirmed responders with squamous NSCLC and 19 (34%) of 56 withnonsquamous NSCLC had ongoing responses after 2 years' minimum follow-up. Nopatient in either docetaxel group had an ongoing response. In the pooledanalysis, the relative reduction in the risk of death with nivolumab versusdocetaxel was 28% (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.84), and rates oftreatment-related adverse events were lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel(any grade, 68% v 88%; grade 3 to 4, 10% v 55%).

Collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test for adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/28993901,"PURPOSE: We conducted a prospective clinical study to individualize adjuvantchemotherapy after complete resection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),based on the drug sensitivity test.METHODS: Patients with resectable c-stage IB-IIIA NSCLC were registered between2005 and 2010. We performed the collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drugsensitivity test (CD-DST) on a fresh surgical specimen to assess in vitrochemosensitivity and evaluated the prognostic outcome after adjuvant chemotherapywith carboplatin/paclitaxel based on the CD-DST.RESULTS: Among 92 registered patients, 87 were eligible for inclusion in theanalysis. The success rate of CD-DST was 86% and chemosensitivity to carboplatin and/or paclitaxel was evident in 57 (76%) of the 75 patients. Adjuvantchemotherapy was completed in 22 (73%) of 30 patients. The 5-year overallsurvival rates were 71, 73, and 75% for all, CD-DST success, and chemosensitivepatients, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survivalrates of the chemosensitive patients who completed adjuvant chemotherapy usingcarboplatin/paclitaxel were 68 and 82%, respectively. The 5-year disease-freesurvival and overall survival rates of the patients with stage II-IIIAchemosensitive NSCLC were 58 and 75%, respectively.

The best confirmed response was partial response in 29 (43.9%)patients and stable disease in 20 (30.9%) patients.CONCLUSION: Combining pictilisib with various standard-of-care first-linetreatment regimens is feasible from a safety perspective in patients with NSCLC, and encouraging preliminary anti-tumour activity was observed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibition by Copanlisib in Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Lymphoma.,/pubmed/28976790,"Purpose Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is critical for theproliferation and survival of malignant B cells. Copanlisib, a pan-class I PI3Kinhibitor with predominant activity against PI3K-_ and -_ isoforms, hasdemonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with indolentlymphoma. Patients and Methods In this phase II study, 142 patients with relapsedor refractory indolent lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy were enrolled to receive copanlisib 60 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.The primary end point was objective response rate; secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Inaddition, safety and gene expression were evaluated. Results Median age was 63years (range, 25 to 82 years), and patients had received a median of three(range, two to nine) prior regimens. The objective response rate was 59% (84 of142 patients); 12% of patients achieved a complete response. Median time toresponse was 53 days. Median duration of response was 22.6 months, medianprogression-free survival was 11.2 months, and median overall survival had notyet been reached. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events weretransient hyperglycemia (all grades, 50%; grade 3 or 4, 41%) and transienthypertension (all grades, 30%; grade 3, 24%). Other grade _3 events includeddecreased neutrophil count (24%) and lung infection (15%). High response rates tocopanlisib were associated with high expression of PI3K/B-cell receptor signalingpathway genes.

Early detection versus primary prevention in the PLCO flexible sigmoidoscopy screening trial: Which has the greatest impact on mortality?,/pubmed/28976536,"ACKGROUND: Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) with flexible sigmoidoscopy(FS) has been shown to reduce CRC mortality. The current study examined whetherthe observed mortality reduction was due primarily to the prevention of incident CRC via removal of adenomatous polyps or to the early detection of cancer andimproved survival.METHODS: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screeningtrial randomized 154,900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years. Individuals underwentFS screening at baseline and at 3 or 5 years versus usual care. CRC-specificsurvival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazardsmodeling. The authors estimated the percentage of CRC deaths averted by earlydetection versus primary prevention using a model that applied intervention armsurvival rates to CRC cases in the usual-care arm and vice versa.RESULTS: A total of 1008 cases of CRC in the intervention arm and 1291 cases ofCRC in the usual-care arm were observed. Through 13 years of follow-up, there wasno significant difference noted between the trial arms with regard toCRC-specific survival for all CRC (68% in the intervention arm vs 65% in theusual-care arm; P =.16) or proximal CRC (68% vs 62%, respectively; P = .11)cases; however, survival in distal CRC cases was found to be higher in theintervention arm compared with the usual-care arm (77% vs 66%; P<.0001). Withineach arm, symptom-detected cases had significantly worse survival compared withscreen-detected cases. Overall, approximately 29% to 35% of averted CRC deathswere estimated to be due to early detection and 65% to 71% were estimated to bedue to primary prevention.CONCLUSIONS: CRC-specific survival was similar across arms in the PLCO trial,suggesting a limited role for early detection in preventing CRC deaths. Modeling suggested that approximately two-thirds of avoided deaths were due to primaryprevention. Future CRC screening guidelines should emphasize primary preventionvia the identification and removal of precursor lesions. Cancer 2017;123:4815-22.© 2017 American Cancer Society.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The current analysis presents final, mature,overall survival (OS) data, together with exploratory analyses that examinedwhether specific biomarkers, including T790M mutation status, were able todifferentiate a relative treatment effect. Patients and Methods Patients wererandomly assigned to gefitinib 250 mg or placebo, in addition to cisplatin 75mg/m2 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy). EGFRmutation status was determined from plasma-derived circulating free tumor-derivedDNA samples (beads, emulsification, amplification, and magnetics digitalpolymerase chain reaction assay, allelic fraction analysis). Results A total of265 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned, and overall data maturity was 66%. Continuation of gefitinib plus cisplatin and pemetrexedwas detrimental to OS when compared with placebo plus cisplatin and pemetrexed(hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.94; P = .016; median OS, 13.4 v 19.5 months). The detriment was statistically significant in patients with T790Mmutation-positive plasma samples (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.21), whereasstatistical significance was not reached in T790M mutation-negative patients (HR,1.15; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.94). PFS in T790M mutation-positive patients was similar between treatments, and the difference observed in T790M mutation-negativepatients did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.03; P = .0745). Conclusion Final OS data from IMPRESS are supportive of earlier PFSresults and are sufficient to warn physicians against the continuation oftreatment with first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors beyond radiologicdisease progression when chemotherapy is initiated.

Benefits of home-based multidisciplinary exercise and supportive care in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer - protocol for a phase II randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/28962608,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and is aleading cause of cancer mortality world-wide. Due to lack of early specificsymptoms, the majority of patients present with advanced, inoperable disease and five-year relative survival across all stages of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) is 14%. People with lung cancer also report higher levels of symptomdistress than those with other forms of cancer. Several benefits for survival andpatient reported outcomes are reported from physical activity and exercise inother tumour groups. We report the protocol for a study investigating thebenefits of exercise, behaviour change and symptom self-management for patientswith recently diagnosed, inoperable, NSCLC.METHODS: This multi-site, parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, powered for superiority, aims to assess functional and patient-reportedoutcomes of a multi-disciplinary, home-based exercise and supportive care programfor people commencing treatment. Ninety-two participants are being recruited fromthree tertiary-care hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Following baselinetesting, participants are randomised using concealed allocation, to receiveeither: a) 8 weeks of home-based exercise (comprising an individualised enduranceand resistance exercise program and behaviour change coaching) andnurse-delivered symptom self-management intervention or b) usual care. Theprimary outcome is the between-group difference in the change in functionalexercise capacity (six-minute walk distance) from baseline to post-programassessment. Secondary outcomes include: objective and self-reported physicalactivity levels, physical activity self-efficacy, behavioural regulation ofmotivation to exercise and resilience, muscle strength (quadriceps and grip),health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression and symptom interference.DISCUSSION: There is a lack of evidence regarding the benefit of exerciseintervention for people with NSCLC, particularly in those with inoperable diseasereceiving treatment. This trial will contribute to evidence currently beinggenerated in national and international trials by implementing and evaluating ahome-based program including three components not yet combined in previousresearch, for people with inoperable NSCLC receiving active treatment andinvolving longer-term follow-up of outcomes.

Antitumor activity of lurbinectedin (PM01183) and doxorubicin in relapsed small-cell lung cancer: results from a phase I study.,/pubmed/28961837,"Background: Lurbinectedin (PM01183) has synergistic antitumor activity whencombined with doxorubicin in mice with xenografted tumors. This phase I trialdetermined the recommended dose (RD) of doxorubicin (bolus) and PM01183 (1-hintravenous infusion) on day 1 every 3_weeks (q3wk), and obtained preliminaryevidence of antitumor activity for this combination in small-cell lung cancer(SCLC).Patients and methods: Patients with advanced solid tumors received doxorubicinand PM01183 following a standard dose escalation design and expansion at the RD. Twenty-seven patients had relapsed SCLC: 12 with sensitive disease (platinum-freeinterval__90_days) and 15 with resistant disease (platinum-freeinterval_<90_days).Results: Doxorubicin 50_mg/m2 and PM01183_4.0_mg flat dose was the RD. Inrelapsed SCLC, treatment tolerance at the RD was manageable. Transient andreversible myelosuppression (including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and febrileneutropenia) was the main toxicity, managed with dose adjustment andcolony-stimulating factors. Fatigue (79%), nausea/vomiting (58%), decreasedappetite (53%), mucositis (53%), alopecia (42%), diarrhea/constipation (42%), andasymptomatic creatinine (68%) and transaminase increases (alanineaminotransferase 42%; aspartate aminotransferase 32%) were common, and mostlymild or moderate. Complete (n_=_2, 8%) and partial response (n_=_13, 50%)occurred in relapsed SCLC, mostly at the RD.

Whole brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery or surgical resection among patients with one to three brain metastases and favorable prognoses: a secondary analysis of EORTC 22952-26001.,/pubmed/28961826,"ackground: The absence of a survival benefit for whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)among randomized trials has been attributed to a competing risk of death fromextracranial disease. We re-analyzed EORTC 22952 to assess the impact of WBRT on survival for patients with controlled extracranial disease or favorableprognoses.Patients and methods: We utilized Cox regression, landmark analysis, and theKaplan-Meier method to evaluate the impact of WBRT on survival accounting for (i)extracranial progression as a time-dependent covariate in all patients and (ii)diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (GPA) score in patients withprimary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Results: A total of 329 patients treated per-protocol were included for analysis with a median follow up of 26_months. One hundred and fifteen (35%) patients had no extracranial progression; 70 (21%) patients had progression_<90 days, 65 (20%)between 90 and 180 days, and 79 (24%) patients_>180 days from randomization.There was no difference in the model-based risk of death in the WBRT group before[hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI)=0.70 (0.45-1.11), P_=_0.133), or after [HR (95%CI)=1.20 (0.89-1.61), P_=_0.214] extracranial progression. Among 177 patientswith NSCLC, 175 had data available for GPA calculation. There was no significant survival benefit to WBRT among NSCLC patients with favorable GPA scores [HR (95% CI)=1.10 (0.68-1.79)] or unfavorable GPA scores [HR (95% CI)=1.11 (0.71-1.76)].Conclusions: Among patients with limited extracranial disease and one to threebrain metastases at enrollment, we found no significant survival benefit to WBRT among NSCLC patients with favorable GPA scores or patients with any histology andcontrolled extracranial disease status. This exploratory analysis of phase IIIdata supports the practice of omitting WBRT for patients with limited brainmetastases undergoing SRS and close surveillance.Clinical Trials Number: NCT00002899.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-onefamily members of variant-positive probands were offered testing: eight of the 25who agreed to testing carried their familial variant (32.0%). Overall, 20patients were identified to have a variant in DICER1 (eight males, 12 females).Of these, 13 (65.0%) presented with clinical manifestations associated with thesyndrome. The most common lesions were pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) (five of 20patients, 25.0%) and pineoblastoma (three of 20 patients, 15.0%).

Two patientswere found to have a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) above the normal range,managed with levothyroxine. Another patient was found to have an isolatedelevation of TSH which normalized without treatment. A fourth patient was foundto have an enlarged thyroid on examination with no palpable nodules or abnormalTFTs.CONCLUSIONS: Average mean dose to the thyroid gland was 6.7¾Gy for thispopulation of stage IV Wilms tumor patients. There was a low rate of thyroiddysfunction, but limited follow-up. Attention to blocking the thyroid gland asmuch as possible when designing radiation fields can potentially mitigate therisks of long-term thyroid effects.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.",/pubmed/28958502,"BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinaseinhibitor. We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged _18 years or _20 years in Japan andSouth Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals inseven countries or special administrative regions. We randomly assignedparticipants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) ororal gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or anotherdiscontinuation criterion was met. Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFRmutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by acentral interactive web response system. The primary endpoint wasprogression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in theintention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who receivedat least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruitingpatients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients wererandomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225). Medianduration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22à1 months (95% CI20à3-23à9). Median progression-free survival according to masked independentreview was 14à7 months (95% CI 11à1-16à6) in the dacomitinib group and 9à2 months(9à1-11à0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0à59, 95% CI 0à47-0à74;p<0à0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31[14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib),diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21(9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib. Twotreatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related tountreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival overgefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLCand should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",RCT,,,,dacomitinib,gefitinib,,,advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer,Median progression-free survival,

An international study to revise the EORTC questionnaire for assessing quality of life in lung cancer patients.,/pubmed/28945875,"ackground: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) QLQ-LC13 was the first module to be used in conjunction with the corequestionnaire, the QLQ-C30. Since the publication of the LC13 in 1994, majoradvances have occurred in the treatment of lung cancer. Given this, an update of the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was undertaken.Methods: The study followed phases I to III of the EORTC Module DevelopmentGuidelines. Phase I generated relevant quality-of-life issues using a mix ofsources including the involvement of 108 lung cancer patients. Phase IItransformed issues into questionnaire items. In an international multicenterstudy (phase III), patients completed both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the 48-itemprovisional lung cancer module generated in phases I and II. Patients rated each of the items regarding relevance, comprehensibility, and acceptance. Patientratings were assessed against a set of prespecified statistical criteria.Descriptive statistics and basic psychometric analyses were carried out.Results: The phase III study enrolled 200 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer from 12 centers in nine countries (Cyprus, Germany, Italy, Israel,Spain, Norway, Poland, Taiwan, and the UK). Mean age was 64_years (39_-_91), 59% of the patients were male, 82% had non-small-cell lung cancer, and 56% weretreated with palliative intent. Twenty-nine of the 48 questions met the criteria for inclusion.Conclusions: The resulting module with 29 questions, thus currently named EORTCQLQ-LC29, retained 12 of the 13 original items, supplemented with 17 items thatprimarily assess treatment side-effects of traditional and newer therapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"First-line icotinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy for patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma (CONVINCE): a phase 3, open-label, randomized study.",/pubmed/28945850,"Background: Icotinib has been previously shown to be non-inferior to gefitinib innon-selected advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients when given as second-or further-line treatment. In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 CONVINCEtrial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of first-line icotinib versuscisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.Patients and methods: Eligible participants were adults with stage IIIB/IV lungadenocarcinoma and exon 19/21 EGFR mutations. Participants were randomlyallocated (1¾:¾1) to receive oral icotinib or 3-week cycle of cisplatin pluspemetrexed for up to four cycles; non-progressive patients after four cycles weremaintained with pemetrexed until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Theprimary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by independentresponse evaluation committee. Other end points included overall survival (OS)and safety.Results: Between January 2013 and August 2014, 296 patients were randomized, and 285 patients were treated (148 to icotinib, 137 to chemotherapy).

No significant difference for OS was observedbetween treatments in the overall population or in EGFR-mutated subgroups (exon19 Del/21 L858R). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) in theicotinib group were rash (14.8%) and diarrhea (7.4%), compared with nausea(45.9%), vomiting (29.2%), and neutropenia (10.9%) in the chemotherapy group. AEs(79.1% versus 94.2%; P_<_0.001) and treatment-related AEs (54.1% versus 90.5%;P_<_0.001) were significantly fewer in the icotinib group than in thechemotherapy group.Conclusions: First-line icotinib significantly improves PFS of advanced lungadenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation with a tolerable and manageable safetyprofile.

We calculateddiagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) scores for NSCLCpatients and evaluated overall survival according to receipt of WBRT and DS-GPAscore using 2 separate cut-points (_2.0 vs <2.0 and¾_2.5 vs <2.5).RESULTS: A total of 126 NSCLC patients were included for analysis, with medianfollow-up of 14.2¾months. Data for DS-GPA calculation were available for 86.3% ofall enrolled NSCLC patients. Overall, 50.0% of patients had DS-GPA score _2.0,and 23.0% of patients had DS-GPA scores _2.5. The SRS and SRS¾+¾WBRT groups were well balanced with regard to prognostic factors. The median survival according toreceipt of WBRT was 11.3¾months (+WBRT) and 17.9¾months (-WBRT) for patients withDS-GPA _2.0 (favorable prognoses, P=.63; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidenceinterval 0.47-1.59). Median survival was 3.7¾months (+WBRT) and 6.6¾months(-WBRT) for patients with DS-GPA <2.0 patients (unfavorable prognoses, P=.85;hazard ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.56-1.62). Outcomes according to the receipt of WBRT and DS-GPA remained similar utilizing DS-GPA _2.5 as a cutoff forfavorable prognoses. There was no interaction between the continuum of the DS-GPAgroups and WBRT on overall survival (P=.53).CONCLUSIONS: We observed no significant differences in survival according toreceipt of WBRT in favorable-prognosis NSCLC patients.

Response to FOLFIRINOX by gender in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: Results from the PRODIGE 4/ ACCORD 11 randomized trial.,/pubmed/28931010,"BACKGROUND: Hohla et al. suggested that female gender could positively predictresponse to FOLFIRINOX in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In thisstudy, we explored the response to the FOLFIRINOX regimen by gender within thetrial PRODIGE4/ACCORD 11.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were described by gender, both in FOLFIRINOX group andin the intention-to-treat population of the trial. The relative effect of gender (females in comparison to males) on overall survival (OS) and progression-freesurvival was estimated by using a Cox proportional hazard model and was presentedwith the Hazard Ratio and their 95% confidence interval. The analysis ofprognostic factors of OS included also: age (older than 65 years), ECOGperformance status, primary tumor location, synchronous metastases, number ofmetastatic sites, hepatic metastasis, pulmonary metastases, lymph nodemetastases, level of Albumin and level of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 andthree domains from the EORTC Quality of Life QLQC-30 questionnaire.RESULTS: The FOLFIRINOX group (N = 171 patients) included 106 women (62%) and 65 men. No significant differences were observed between genders regardingdemographic and clinical parameters, excepted for lymph nodes metastasis (17% and35% in women and men respectively; p = 0.012). Median OS was longer for femalesas compared to males in FOLFIRINOX group (13.1 versus 10.3 months respectively;HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06). Similarly, median PFS was superior (7.2 versus 5.9months; HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10). Nevertheless, in both cases, thedifferences were not statistically significant (p = 0.10 et p = 0.169,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the overall survival and progression-free survivalrates were not significantly higher for females than for males in FOLFIRINOXgroup (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06 and HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10respectively). Even if the percentage of patients with lymph node metastasis ishigher for males than for females, the interaction between gender and lymph node metastasis was non-significant.

This subject deserves further evaluation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00112658.KEY MESSAGE: Our analysis suggests that FOLFIRINOX, as first-line option forpatients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are younger than 76 years and who have a good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1), no cardiac ischemia and normal ornearly normal bilirubin levels, is beneficial, but not particularly in femalepatients.",Single arm,,,,FOLFIRINOX,,,,advanced pancreatic cancer,overall survival,
The Improving Rural Cancer Outcomes Trial: a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention to reduce time to diagnosis in rural cancer patients in Western Australia.,/pubmed/28926528,"BACKGROUND: Rural Australians have poorer survival for most common cancers, duepartially to later diagnosis. Internationally, several initiatives to improvecancer outcomes have focused on earlier presentation to healthcare and timelydiagnosis. We aimed to measure the effect of community-based symptom awarenessand general practice-based educational interventions on the time to diagnosis in rural patients presenting with breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer inWestern Australia.METHODS: 2 _ 2 factorial cluster randomised controlled trial. CommunityIntervention: cancer symptom awareness campaign tailored for rural Australians.GP intervention: resource card with symptom risk assessment charts and localcancer referral pathways implemented through multiple academic detailing visits. Trial Area A received the community symptom awareness and Trial Area B acted asthe community campaign control region. Within both Trial Areas general practices were randomised to the GP intervention or control.PRIMARY OUTCOME: total diagnostic interval (TDI).RESULTS: 1358 people with incident breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancerwere recruited. There were no significant differences in the median or ln meanTDI at either intervention level (community intervention vs control: median TDI107.5 vs 92 days; ln mean difference 0.08 95% CI -0.06-0.23 P=0.27; GPintervention vs control: median TDI 97 vs 96.5 days; ln mean difference 0.004 95%CI -0.18-0.19 P=0.99). There were no significant differences in the TDI whenanalysed by factorial design, tumour group or sub-intervals of the TDI.CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest trial to test the effect of community campaignor GP interventions on timeliness of cancer diagnosis. We found no effect ofeither intervention. This may reflect limited dose of the interventions, or thelimited duration of follow-up. Alternatively, these interventions do not have ameasurable effect on time to cancer diagnosis.",RCT,,,,general practice-based educational interventions,community-based symptom awareness,,,Rural Australians,total diagnostic interval,
Phase 1 study of intravenous administration of the chimeric adenovirus enadenotucirev in patients undergoing primary tumor resection.,/pubmed/28923104,"BACKGROUND: Enadenotucirev (formerly ColoAd1) is a tumor-selective chimericadenovirus with demonstrated preclinical activity. This phase 1 Mechanism ofAction study assessed intravenous (IV) delivery of enadenotucirev in patientswith resectable colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),urothelial cell cancer (UCC), and renal cell cancer (RCC) with a comparatorintratumoral (IT) dosed CRC patient cohort.METHODS: Seventeen patients scheduled for primary tumor resection were enrolled. IT injection of enadenotucirev (CRC only) was administered as a single dose (_3¾_¾1011 viral particles [vp]) on day 1, followed by resection during days 8-15. IV infusion of enadenotucirev was administered by three separate doses (1¾_¾1012 vp) on days 1, 3, and 5, followed by resection during days 8-15 (CRC) or days10-25 (NSCLC, UCC, and RCC). Enadenotucirev activity was measured usingimmunohistochemical staining of nuclear viral hexon and quantitative polymerasechain reaction for viral genomic DNA.RESULTS: Delivery of enadenotucirev was observed in most tumor samples following IV infusion, with little or no demonstrable activity in normal tissue. This virusdelivery (by both IV and IT dosing) was accompanied by high local CD8+ cellinfiltration in 80% of tested tumor samples, suggesting a potentialenadenotucirev-driven immune response. Both methods of enadenotucirev deliverywere well tolerated, with no treatment-associated serious adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides key delivery and feasibility data to support theuse of IV infusion of enadenotucirev, or therapeutic transgene-bearingderivatives of it, in clinical trials across a range of epithelial tumors,including the ongoing combination study of enadenotucirev with the checkpointinhibitor nivolumab. It also provides insights into the potentialimmune-stimulating properties of enadenotucirev.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This MOA study was a phase 1, multicenter, non-randomized,open-label study to investigate the administration of enadenotucirev in apreoperative setting (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02053220).",N,,,,,,,,,,
Viral based vaccine TG4010 induces broadening of specific immune response and improves outcome in advanced NSCLC.,/pubmed/28923084,"BACKGROUND: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving TG4010, atherapeutic viral vaccine encoding human Mucin 1 and interleukin-2 in addition tostandard chemotherapy, displayed longer overall survival in comparison to that ofpatients treated with standard chemotherapy alone. Our study intended toestablish the association between overall survival and vaccine-induced T cellresponses against tumor associated antigens (TAA) targeted by the vaccine.METHOD: The TIME trial was a placebo-controlled, randomized phase II study aimed at assessing efficacy of TG4010 with chemotherapy in NSCLC. 78 patients from the TIME study carrying the HLA-A02*01 haplotype were analyzed using combinatorialencoding of MHC multimers to detect low frequencies of cellular immune responses to TG4010 and other unrelated TAA.RESULTS: We report that improvement of survival under TG4010 treatment correlatedwith development of T cell responses against MUC1. Interestingly, responsesagainst MUC1 were associated with broadening of CD8 responses againstnon-targeted TAA, thus demonstrating induction of epitope spreading.CONCLUSION: Our results support the causality of specific T-cell response inimproved survival in NSCLC. Additionally, vaccine induced epitope spreading toother TAA participates to the enrichment of the diversity of the anti-tumorresponse. Hence, TG4010 appears as a useful therapeutic option to maximizeresponse rate and clinical benefit in association with other targetedimmuno-modulators.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT01383148on June 23rd, 2011.",N,,,,,,,,,,

All received preoperative chemotherapy.RESULTS: Clinical characteristics were similar in both trials: 4 patients hadpulmonary metastases at diagnosis, 4 had _-fetoprotein¾<100¾ng/ml, 68 wereoperated by partial hepatectomy, and 7 received liver transplant. Chemotherapycourses were delayed in 8.5%, 8.4%, and 11.8% of cycles in the three groups.Doses were calculated according to weight for children¾<5 and 5-10¾kg, andfurther reduced in 18.1%, 6.8%, and 5.9% of cycles. Acute toxicity wasmanageable. Long-term hearing loss was the major problem at follow-up occurringin two-thirds of children. Ten patients experienced progression or relapse, and 5of 10 died. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, the 5-year overall survival(OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]:84-96%) and 87% (95% CI: 78-92%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year OS and EFS of children¾<6 months of age affected by HBseem to be similar to those documented in the elder children. Dose reduction doesnot seem to jeopardize the long-term outcome and may explain the lower toxicityprofile. Ototoxicity though appears as high as in the whole population of SIOPEL 2 and 3. The treatment for these children should be further explored ininternational studies, particularly focusing on prevention of hearing loss.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Dabrafenib, alone or combined with trametinib, has shownsubstantial antitumour activity in patients with previously treatedBRAFV600E-mutant metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed toassess the activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib treatment inpreviously untreated patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: In this phase 2, sequentially enrolled, multicohort, multicentre,non-randomised, open-label study, adults (_18 years of age) with previouslyuntreated metastatic BRAFV600E-mutant NSCLC were enrolled into cohort C from 19centres in eight countries within North America, Europe, and Asia. Patientsreceived oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice per day plus oral trametinib 2 mg once per day until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, consent withdrawal,or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response,defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1.The primary and safety analyses were by intention to treat in theprotocol-defined population (previously untreated patients). The study isongoing, but no longer recruiting patients.

"A randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of eribulin to treatment of physician's choice in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",/pubmed/28911085,"Background: Eribulin is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mechanismof action. This phase 3 study aimed to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with heavily pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving eribulin to treatment of physician's choice (TPC).Patients and methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC who had received__2 priortherapies, including platinum-based doublet and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were randomly assigned to receive eribulin or TPC(gemcitabine, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, docetaxel). The primary endpoint was OS.Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and objective response rate.Results: Five hundred and forty patients were randomized to either eribulin(n_=_270) or TPC (n_=_270). Median OS for eribulin and TPC was the same:9.5_months [hazard ratio (HR): 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.41;P_=_0.13]. Progression-free survival for eribulin and TPC was 3.0 and 2.8_months,respectively (HR: 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 0.90-1.32; P_=_0.39). Theobjective response rate was 12% for eribulin and 15% for TPC. Clinical benefitrate (eribulin, 57%; TPC, 55%) and disease control rate (eribulin, 63%; TPC, 58%)were similar between treatment arms. The most common adverse event wasneutropenia, which occurred in 57% of eribulin patients and 49% of TPC patientsat all grades. Other non-hematologic side-effects were manageable and similar in both groups except for peripheral sensory neuropathy (all grades; eribulin, 16%; TPC, 9%).Conclusion: This phase 3 study did not demonstrate superiority of eribulin overTPC with regard to overall survival.

Lung Cancer Risk Associated With New Solid Nodules in the National Lung Screening Trial.,/pubmed/28898131,"OBJECTIVE: As low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening moves into routineclinical practice, evaluation of nodules identified as new becomes critical. Weexamine the frequency and clinical outcomes of new lung nodules reported at thetwo postbaseline annual screening examinations (hereafter referred to aspostbaseline time 1 [T1] and time 2 [T2]), compared with those detected atbaseline in the National Lung Screening Trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiologists classified nodules detected at T1 and T2 asnew or preexisting on the basis of comparison with findings from prior LDCTscreening examinations. Subjects were tracked for lung cancer incidence andmortality. We examined the incidence of new nodules and their associated lungcancer risk by nodule size (i.e., mean diameter).RESULTS: A total of 25,002 subjects underwent the baseline LDCT screeningexamination and either a T1 or T2 LDCT screen. At both T1 and T2, 2.6% ofsubjects had new solid nodules. Of the new solid nodules, 53.0% were < 6 mm,29.5% were 6 to < 10 mm, and 17.1% were _ 10 mm. Lung cancer risk (defined asdiagnosis within 2 years of baseline) increased from 1.1% for nodules < 4 mm to24.0% for those _ 20 mm. Compared with solid nodules detected at baseline, thecancer risk was higher for new solid nodules that were 4 to < 6 mm (p < 0.001)and 6 to < 8 mm (p < 0.001) but lower for new nodules _ 20 mm (p = 0.03). Cancersassociated with new nodules had significantly poorer survival than did thoseassociated with baseline nodules and were significantly less likely to beadenocarcinoma.CONCLUSION: The incidence of new nodules was 2-3% annually, with the cancer risk increasing by nodule size. New nodules may convey differential lung cancer risks by size, compared with baseline nodules.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Stereotactic body radiotherapy for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer using higher doses for larger tumors: results of the second study.,/pubmed/28893300,"BACKGROUND: Efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in stage Inon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has almost been established. In Japan, theprotocol of 48¾Gy in 4 fractions over 4¾days has been most often employed, buthigher doses may be necessary to control large tumors. Previously, we conducted aclinical study using SBRT for stage I NSCLC employing different doses dependingon tumor diameter, which was closed in 2008. Thereafter, a new study employinghigher doses has been conducted, which is reported here. The purpose of thisstudy was to review the safety and effectiveness of the higher doses.METHODS: We escalated the total dose for the improvement of local control forlarge tumors. In this study, 71 patients underwent SBRT between December 2008 andApril 2014. Isocenter doses of 48, 50, and 52¾Gy were administered for tumorswith a longest diameter of <_1.5¾cm, 1.5-3¾cm, and >_3¾cm, respectively. It wasrecommended to cover 95% of the PTV with at least 90% of the isocenter dose, and in all but one cases, 95% of the PTV received at least 80% of the prescribeddose. Treatments were delivered in 4 fractions, giving 2 fractions per week. SBRTwas performed with 6-MV photons using 4 non-coplanar and 3 coplanar beams.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 44¾months for all patients and 61¾monthsfor living patients. Overall survival (OS) was 65%, progression-free survival(PFS) was 55%, and cumulative incidence of local recurrence (LR) was 15% at5¾years. The 5-year OS was 69% for 57 stage IA patients and 53% for 14 stage IBpatients (p_=_0.44). The 5-year PFS was 55 and 54%, respectively (p_=_0.98). The 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 11 and 31%, respectively (p_=_0.09). Thecumulative incidence of Grade¾__2 radiation pneumonitis was 25%.CONCLUSIONS: Our newer SBRT study yielded reasonable local control and overallsurvival and acceptable toxicity, but escalating the total dose did not lead toimproved outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000027231 , registered on 3 May 2017.

The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after thepatients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points wereprogression-free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent centralreview) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12-month and 18-month progression-free survival rates, theobjective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distantmetastasis, and safety.RESULTS: Of 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The medianprogression-free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death,0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P<0.001); the 12-month progression-free survival ratewas 55.9% versus 35.3%, and the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 44.2%versus 27.0%.

EGFR T790M mutation testing of non-small cell lung cancer tissue and blood samples artificially spiked with circulating cell-free tumor DNA: results of a round robin trial.,/pubmed/28884371,"The European Commision (EC) recently approved osimertinib for the treatment ofadult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) harboring EGFR T790M mutations. Besides tissue-based testing, bloodsamples containing cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used tointerrogate T790M status. Herein, we describe the conditions and results of around robin trial (RRT) for T790M mutation testing in NSCLC tissue specimens and peripheral blood samples spiked with cell line DNA mimicking tumor-derived ctDNA.The underlying objectives of this two-staged external quality assessment (EQA)approach were (a) to evaluate the accuracy of T790M mutations testing acrossmultiple centers and (b) to investigate if a liquid biopsy-based testing forT790M mutations in spiked blood samples is feasible in routine diagnostic. Based on a successfully completed internal phase I RRT, an open RRT for EGFR T790Mmutation testing in tumor tissue and blood samples was initiated. In total, 48pathology centers participated in the EQA. Of these, 47 (97.9%) centers submittedtheir analyses within the pre-defined time frame and 44 (tissue), respectively,40 (plasma) successfully passed the test. The overall success rates in the RRTphase II were 91.7% (tissue) and 83.3% (blood), respectively. Thirty-eight out of48 participants (79.2%) successfully passed both parts of the RRT. The RRT forblood-based EGFR testing initiated in Germany is, to the best of our knowledge,the first of his kind in Europe.

Phase 1-2 Study of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography for Assessment of Pulmonary Function in Radiation Therapy Planning.,/pubmed/28871983,"PURPOSE: To quantify lung function according to a dual-energy computed tomography(DECT)-derived iodine map in patients treated with radiation therapy for lungcancer, and to assess the dosimetric impact of its integration in radiationtherapy planning.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiationtherapy for early-stage or intensity modulated radiation therapy for locallyadvanced lung cancer were prospectively enrolled in this study. A DECT intreatment position was obtained at time of treatment planning. The relativecontribution of each voxel to the total lung function was based on iodinedistribution. The composition of each voxel was determined on the basis of a2-material decomposition. The DECT-derived lobar function was compared withsingle photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Afunctional map was integrated in the treatment planning system using 6 subvolumesof increasing iodine distribution levels. Percent lung volume receiving 5¾Gy(V5), V20, and mean dose (MLD) to whole lungs (anatomic) versus functional lungs were compared.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with lung cancer, including 18 patients treatedwith stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and 7 patients with intensitymodulated radiation therapy (locally advanced), were included. Eighty-fourpercent had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Median (range) forcedexpiratory volume in 1¾second was 62% of predicted (29%-113%), and mediandiffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was 56% (39%-91%). There was astrong linear correlation between DECT- and SPECT/CT-derived lobar function(Pearson coefficient correlation r=0.89, P<.00001). Mean (range) differences inV5, V20, and MLD between anatomic and functional lung volumes were 16% (0%-48%,P=.03), 5% (1%-15%, P=.12), and 15% (1%-43%, P=.047), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Lobar function derived from a DECT iodine map correlates well withSPECT/CT, and its integration in lung treatment planning is associated withsignificant differences in V5 and MLD to functional lungs. Future work willinvolve integration of the weighted functional volume in the treatment planningsystem, along with integration of an iodine map for functional lung-sparing IMRT.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Safety and activity of microRNA-loaded minicells in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma: a first-in-man, phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study.",/pubmed/28870611,"BACKGROUND: TargomiRs are minicells (EnGeneIC Dream Vectors) loaded withmiR-16-based mimic microRNA (miRNA) and targeted to EGFR that are designed tocounteract the loss of the miR-15 and miR-16 family miRNAs, which is associatedwith unsuppressed tumour growth in preclinical models of malignant pleuralmesothelioma. We aimed to assess the safety, optimal dosing, and activity ofTargomiRs in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.METHODS: In this first-in-man, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial at threemajor cancer centres in Sydney (NSW, Australia), we recruited adults (aged _18years) with a confirmed diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma, measurabledisease, radiological signs of progression after previous chemotherapy, EasternCooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of 3months or more, immunohistochemical evidence of tumour EGFR expression, andadequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function.

Overall, five dose-limiting toxicities were noted: infusion-relatedinflammatory symptoms and coronary ischaemia, respectively, in two patients given5___109 TargomiRs twice weekly; anaphylaxis and cardiomyopathy, respectively, in two patients given 5___109 TargomiRs once weekly but who received reduceddexamethasone prophylaxis; and non-cardiac pain in one patient who received5___109 TargomiRs once weekly. We established that 5___109 TargomiRs once weekly was the maximum tolerated dose. TargomiR infusions were accompanied by transient lymphopenia (25 [96%] of 26 patients), temporal hypophosphataemia (17 [65%] of 26patients), increased aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotranferase (six[23%] of 26 patients), and increased alkaline phosphatase blood concentrations(two [8%]). Cardiac events occurred in five patients: three patients hadelectrocardiographic changes, one patient had ischaemia, and one patient hadTakotsubo cardiomyopathy. Of the 22 patients who were assessed for response byCT, one (5%) had a partial response, 15 (68%) had stable disease, and six (27%)had progressive disease. The proportion of patients who achieved an objectiveresponse was therefore one (5%) of 22, and the duration of the objective responsein that patient was 32 weeks. Median overall survival was 200 days (95% CI94-358). During the trial, 21 deaths occurred, of which 20 were related to tumourprogression and one was due to bowel perforation.INTERPRETATION: The acceptable safety profile and early signs of activity ofTargomiRs in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma support additionalstudies of TargomiRs in combination with chemotherapy or immune checkpointinhibitors.FUNDING: Asbestos Diseases Research Foundation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term pulmonary disease among Swiss childhood cancer survivors.,/pubmed/28868646,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary diseases are potentially severe late complications ofchildhood cancer treatment that increase mortality risk among survivors. Thisnationwide study assesses the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary diseases inlong-term childhood cancer survivors (CCS) and their siblings, and quantifiestreatment-related risks.METHODS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, we studied CCS whowere diagnosed between 1976 and 2005 and alive at least 5 years after diagnosis. We compared prevalence of self-reported pulmonary diseases (pneumonia, chest wallabnormalities, lung fibrosis, emphysema) between CCS and their siblings,calculated cumulative incidence of pulmonary diseases using the Kaplan-Meiermethod, and determined risk factors using multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: CCS reported more pneumonias (10% vs. 7%, P = 0.020) and chest wallabnormalities (2% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.003) than siblings. Treatment with busulfan wasassociated with prevalence of pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 1.1-14.9), and thoracic surgery was associated with chest wallabnormalities and lung fibrosis (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.7 and OR 6.3, 95% CI1.7-26.6). Cumulative incidence of any pulmonary disease after 35 years offollow-up was 21%. For pneumonia, the highest cumulative incidence was seen inCCS treated with both pulmotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the thorax(23%).CONCLUSION: This nationwide study in CCS found an increased risk for pulmonarydiseases, especially pneumonia, while still young, which indicates that CCS need long-term pulmonary follow-up.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Correlation of early PET findings with tumor response to molecular targeted agents in patients with advanced driver-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/28864950,"Recent advances in positron emission tomography withfluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) have facilitated not only the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, but also the prediction of treatment outcome. Thepresent study was designed to assess the usefulness of early FDG-PET examination for predicting subsequent tumor size reduction in response to molecular targeted agents in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitive geneanomalies. I. In 29 targeted lesions of 10 NSCLC patients, changes in FDG uptake before and on day 7 after the initiation of molecular targeted therapy(gefitinib, n¾=¾7; crizotinib, n¾=¾3) were compared with subsequent radiographic tumor size reduction by RECIST. FDG uptake was evaluated as the maximumstandardized uptake value (SUVmax) of each targeted lesion. SUVmax decreased inall lesions after therapy (mean SUVmax 8.3¾±¾3.4 before to 3.7¾±¾1.8 aftertherapy, p¾<¾0.05). The % decrease in SUVmax of each lesion was significantlycorrelated with the % tumor size reduction (r¾=¾0.44). In addition, the reductionrate of SUVmax in metastatic bone lesions after initiation of molecular targeted therapy was significantly lower than that in targeted organs (27.1¾±¾27.5 vs.51.2¾±¾21.3%, respectively, p¾<¾0.05). Early reduction in FDG-PET uptake afterinitiation of molecular targeted agents was able to predict subsequent tumorreduction in patients harboring EGFR-mutated or ALK-positive NSCLC. In addition, nontargeted bone metastasis may have different glucose metabolism after TKItreatment compared with other involved organs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Phase III Trial of Ipilimumab Combined With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Advanced Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/28854067,"Purpose Patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have poorprognosis and limited treatment options. This randomized, double-blind, phase IIIstudy investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placeboplus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-na´ve squamous NSCLC wererandomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blindedipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedulecomprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point wasoverall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded studytherapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least onedose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388;chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapyplus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio,0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, andTRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plusipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred withchemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo.Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. Thesafety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies. Ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in this population.",RCT,,,,paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab,placebo,,,squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,overall survival,
Adherence and feasibility of 2 treatment schedules of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with completely resected advanced lung cancer: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28851314,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter randomized study of adjuvant S-1administration schedules for surgically treated pathological stage IB-IIIAnon-small cell lung cancer patients.METHODS: Patients receiving curative surgical resection were centrally randomizedto arm A (4¾weeks of oral S-1 and a 2-week rest over 12¾months) or arm B (2¾weeksof S-1 and a 1-week rest over 12¾months). The primary endpoints were completionof the scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy over 12¾months, and the secondaryendpoints were relative total administration dose, toxicity, and 3-yeardisease-free survival.RESULTS: From April 2005 to January 2012, 80 patients were enrolled, of whom 78patients were eligible and assessable. The planned S-1 administration over12¾months was accomplished to 28 patients in 38 arm A patients (73.7%) and to 18 patients in 40 arm B patients (45.0%, p¾=¾0.01). The average relative doseintensity was 77.2% for arm A and 58.4% for arm B (p¾=¾0.01). Drug-related grade 3 adverse events were recorded for 11% of arm A and 5% of arm B (p¾=¾0.43). Grade1-3 elevation of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, andalanine transaminase were more frequently recorded in arm A than in arm B. The3-year disease-free survival rate was 79.0% for arm A and 79.3% for arm B(p¾=¾0.94).CONCLUSIONS: The superiority of feasibility of the shorter schedule was notrecognized in the present study. The conventional schedule showed highercompletion rates over 12¾months (p¾=¾0.01) and relative dose intensity of S-1(p¾=¾0.01). Toxicity showed no significant difference among the shorter schedule and the conventional schedule, except for grade 1-3 elevation of bilirubin.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized multicenter study was retrospectivelyregistered with the UMIN-CTR (UMIN000016086, registration date December 30,2014).",RCT,,,, (4æweeks of oral S-1 and a 2-week rest over 12æmonths) ,2æweeks of S-1 and a 1-week rest over 12æmonths,,,surgically treated pathological stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer,Adherence and feasibility,
"Carfilzomib or bortezomib in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (ENDEAVOR): an interim overall survival analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.",/pubmed/28843768,"BACKGROUND: The phase 3 ENDEAVOR trial was a head-to-head comparison of twoproteasome inhibitors in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.Progression-free survival was previously reported to be significantly longer withcarfilzomib administered in combination with dexamethasone than with bortezomiband dexamethasone in an interim analysis. The aim of this second interim analysiswas to compare overall survival between the two treatment groups.METHODS: ENDEAVOR was a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial inpatients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were recruitedfrom 198 hospitals and outpatient clinics in 27 countries in Europe, NorthAmerica, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and had received betweenone and three previous lines of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) toreceive carfilzomib and dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or bortezomib anddexamethasone (bortezomib group) through a blocked randomisation scheme (blocksize of four), stratified by International Staging System stage, previous linesof treatment, previous proteasome inhibitor therapy, and planned route ofbortezomib delivery if assigned to the bortezomib group. Carfilzomib (20 mg/m2 ondays 1 and 2 of cycle 1; 56 mg/m2 thereafter) was given as a 30-min intravenousinfusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of 28-day cycles; bortezomib (1à3 mg/m2) was given as an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 21-day cycles. Dexamethasone (20 mg oral or intravenous infusion) was givenon days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 in the carfilzomib group and on days 1, 2,4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 in the bortezomib group. The primary endpoint of ENDEAVOR,progression-free survival, has been previously reported. A stratified log-ranktest was used to compare overall survival between treatment groups for thisprospectively planned second interim analysis. Efficacy assessments were done in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population) and the safetyanalysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01568866, and is nolonger enrolling patients.FINDINGS: Between June 20, 2012, and June 30, 2014, 1096 patients were assessedfor eligibility, of whom 929 were randomly assigned (464 to the carfilzomib groupand 465 to the bortezomib group). The cutoff date for this prespecified interimanalysis was Jan 3, 2017. Median overall survival was 47à6 months (95% CI42à5-not evaluable) in the carfilzomib group versus 40à0 months (32à6-42à3) inthe bortezomib group (hazard ratio 0à791 [95% CI 0à648-0à964], one-sidedp=0à010). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 377 (81%) of 463patients in the carfilzomib group and 324 (71%) of 456 patients in the bortezomibgroup, and serious adverse events in 273 (59%) patients in the carfilzomib group and 182 (40%) in the bortezomib group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverseevents were anaemia (76 [16%] of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group vs 46[10%] of 456 patients in the bortezomib group), hypertension (67 [15%] vs 15[3%]), pneumonia (42 [9%] vs 39 [9%]), thrombocytopenia (41 [9%] vs 43 [9%]),fatigue (31 [7%] vs 35 [8%]), dyspnoea (29 [6%] vs ten [2%]), decreasedlymphocyte count (29 [6%] vs nine [2%]), diarrhoea (18 [4%] vs 39 [9%]), andperipheral neuropathy (six [1%] vs 28 [6%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred infive (1%) of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group (pneumonia [n=2], interstitiallung disease [n=1], septic shock [n=1], and unknown [n=1]) and two (<1%) of 456patients in the bortezomib group (cardiac arrest [n=1] and pneumonia [n=1]).INTERPRETATION: Carfilzomib provided a significant and clinically meaningfulreduction in the risk of death compared with bortezomib. To our knowledge,carfilzomib is the first and only multiple myeloma treatment that extends overallsurvival in the relapsed setting over the current standard of care.

Effect of Cannabidiol on Drop Seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.,/pubmed/29768152,"BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures inpatients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy andsafety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medicationto treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severedevelopmental epileptic encephalopathy.METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (agerange, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram(10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equallydivided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage changefrom baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.RESULTS: A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebogroup. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline indrop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mgcannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebogroup (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 forthe 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse eventsamong the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite,and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Sixpatients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiolgroup discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and werewithdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) hadelevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, theaddition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to aconventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in thefrequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol includedelevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.

Self-Management education for adults with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE (UK)]: a randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/29717699,"ACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition resulting in recurrentseizures. Research evidence in long-term conditions suggests that patientsbenefit from self-management education and that this may improve quality of life (QoL). Epilepsy self-management education has yet to be tested in a UK setting.OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness ofSelf-Management education for people with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE(UK)].DESIGN: A parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial.SETTING: Participants were recruited from eight hospitals in London andsouth-east England.PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged __16 years with epilepsy and two or more epilepticseizures in the past year, who were currently being prescribed antiepilepticdrugs.INTERVENTION: A 2-day group self-management course alongside treatment as usual(TAU). The control group received TAU.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is QoL in people with epilepsy at12-month follow-up using the Quality Of Life In Epilepsy 31-P (QOLIE-31-P) scale.Other outcomes were seizure control, impact of epilepsy, medication adverseeffects, psychological distress, perceived stigma, self-mastery and medicationadherence. Cost-effectiveness analyses and a process evaluation were undertaken.RANDOMISATION: A 1_:_1 ratio between trial arms using fixed block sizes of two.BLINDING: Participants were not blinded to their group allocation because of the nature of the study. Researchers involved in data collection and analysisremained blinded throughout.RESULTS: The trial completed successfully. A total of 404 participants wereenrolled in the study [SMILE (UK), n_=_205; TAU, n_=_199] with 331 completing thefinal follow-up at 12 months [SMILE (UK), n_=_163; TAU, n_=_168]. In theintervention group, 61.5% completed all sessions of the course. No adverse eventswere found to be related to the intervention. At baseline, participants had amean age of 41.7 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.1 years], and had epilepsy fora median of 18 years. The mean QOLIE-31-P score for the whole group at baselinewas 66.0 out of 100.0 (SD 14.2). Clinically relevant levels of anxiety symptomswere reported in 53.6% of the group and depression symptoms in 28.0%. The resultsfollowing an intention-to-treat analysis showed no change in any measures at the 12-month follow-up [QOLIE-31-P: SMILE (UK) mean: 67.4, SD 13.5; TAU mean: 69.5,SD 14.8]. The cost-effectiveness study showed that SMILE (UK) was possiblycost-effective but was also associated with lower QoL. The process evaluationwith 20 participants revealed that a group course increased confidence by sharingwith others and improved self-management behaviours.CONCLUSIONS: For people with epilepsy and persistent seizures, a 2-dayself-management education course is cost-saving, but does not improve QoL after12-months or reduce anxiety or depression symptoms. A psychological intervention may help with anxiety and depression. Interviewed participants reported attendinga group course increased their confidence and helped them improve theirself-management.FUTURE WORK: More research is needed on self-management courses, withpsychological components and integration with routine monitoring.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN57937389.FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full inHealth Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 21.

"Regional cerebral effects of ketone body infusion with 3-hydroxybutyrate in humans: Reduced glucose uptake, unchanged oxygen consumption and increased blood flow by positron emission tomography. A randomized, controlled trial.",/pubmed/29489818,"Ketone bodies are neuroprotective in neurological disorders such as epilepsy. We randomly studied nine healthy human subjects twice-with and without continuousinfusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate-to define potential underlying mechanisms, assessedregionally (parietal, occipital, temporal, cortical grey, and frontal) by PETscan. During 3-hydroxybutyrate infusions concentrations increased to 5.5±0.4mmol/l and cerebral glucose utilisation decreased 14%, oxygen consumptionremained unchanged, and cerebral blood flow increased 30%. We conclude that acute3-hydroxybutyrate infusion reduces cerebral glucose uptake and increases cerebralblood flow in all measured brain regions, without detectable effects on cerebral oxygen uptake though oxygen extraction decreased. Increased oxygen supplyconcomitant with unchanged oxygen utilisation may contribute to theneuroprotective effects of ketone bodies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Unblinded, randomized multicenter trial comparing lamotrigine and valproate combination with controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy as initial drug regimen in untreated epilepsy.",/pubmed/29324401,"PURPOSE: To compare controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy (CBZ-CR) withlamotrigine and valproate combination therapy (LTG_+_VPA) in equivalent totaldrug load, as initial drug regimen in untreated patients with partial and/orgeneralized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS).METHODS: This unblinded, randomized, 60-week superiority trial recruited patientshaving two or more unprovoked seizures with at least one seizure during previous three months. After randomization into CBZ-CR or LTG_+_VPA, patients entered intoeight-week titration phase (TP), followed by 52-week maintenance phase (MP).Median doses of CBZ-CR and LTG_+_VPA were 600_mg/day and 75_mg/day_+_500_mg/day, respectively. Primary outcome measure was completion rate (CR), a proportion ofpatients who have completed the 60-week study as planned. Secondary efficacymeasures included seizure-free rate (SFR) for 52-week of MP and time to firstseizure (TTFS) during MP.RESULTS: Among 207 randomized patients, 202 underwent outcome analysis (104 inCBZ-CR, 98 in LTG_+_VPA). CR was 62.5% in CBZ-CR and 65.3% in LTG_+_VPA(p_=_0.678). SFR during MP was higher in LTG_+_VPA (64.1%) than CBZ-CR (47.8%)(P_=_0.034). TTFS was shorter with CBZ-CR (p_=_0.041). Incidence of adverseeffects (AEs) were 57.7% in CBZ-CR and 60.2% in LTG_+_VPA and premature drugwithdrawal rates due to AEs were 12.5% and 7.1%, respectively, which were notsignificantly different.CONCLUSION: CR was comparable between LTG_+_VPA and CBZ-CR, however, both SFR for52-week MP and TTFS during MP were in favor of LTG_+_VPA than CBZ-CR. The studysuggested that LTG_+_VPA can be an option as initial drug regimen for untreatedpatients with partial seizures and/or GTCS except for women of reproductive age.",RCT,,,,controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy,lamotrigine and valproate combination therapy,,,partial and/or generalized tonic-clonic seizures,completion rate,
Application of Rubber Band with Hooks on Both Ends for Vagus Nerve Stimulator Implantation.,/pubmed/29289803,"BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a valuable therapeutic option formany types of drug-resistant epilepsy. Muscle hooks and carotid endarterectomyrings have been used for cervical delamination preceding the implantation ofstimulation electrodes. The attachment on both sides of a rubber band ofKamiyama-style hanging needles, as are used for scalp and dural retraction duringcraniotomy, yields a useful tool for VNS implantation. Here we report ourexperience with this method.METHODS: We present our method using a rubber band plus hooks and a review of 21 consecutive patients who¾underwent VNS implantation using our rubberband-plus-hooks method.RESULTS: None of the 21 patients experienced intraoperative or perioperativecomplications. Hooks placed in connective tissue around the common carotid arteryand jugular vein raised the vagus nerve by elevating the carotid sheath. A singlesurgeon was able to perform all cervical manipulations under a surgicalmicroscope. The average operation time in this series of 21 patients was 137minutes.CONCLUSIONS: The use of hooks attached to both sides of a rubber band renderedVNS implantation safer by lifting the vagus nerve and standardizing theprocedure.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Breakthrough seizures-Further analysis of the Standard versus New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) study.,/pubmed/29267375,"OBJECTIVES: To develop prognostic models for risk of a breakthrough seizure, riskof seizure recurrence after a breakthrough seizure, and likelihood of achieving12-month remission following a breakthrough seizure. A breakthrough seizure isone that occurs following at least 12 months remission whilst on treatment.METHODS: We analysed data from the SANAD study. This long-term randomised trialcompared treatments for participants with newly diagnosed epilepsy. MultivariableCox models investigated how clinical factors affect the probability of eachoutcome. Best fitting multivariable models were produced with variable reduction by Akaike's Information Criterion. Risks associated with combinations of riskfactors were calculated from each multivariable model.RESULTS: Significant factors in the multivariable model for risk of abreakthrough seizure following 12-month remission were number of tonic-clonicseizures by achievement of 12-month remission, time taken to achieve 12-monthremission, and neurological insult. Significant factors in the model for risk of seizure recurrence following a breakthrough seizure were total number of drugsattempted to achieve 12-month remission, time to achieve 12-month remission priorto breakthrough seizure, and breakthrough seizure treatment decision. Significantfactors in the model for likelihood of achieving 12-month remission after abreakthrough seizure were gender, age at breakthrough seizure, time to achieve12-month remission prior to breakthrough, and breakthrough seizure treatmentdecision.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis to consider risk of a breakthroughseizure and subsequent outcomes. The described models can be used to identifypeople most likely to have a breakthrough seizure, a seizure recurrence followinga breakthrough seizure, and to achieve 12-month remission following abreakthrough seizure. The results suggest that focussing on achieving 12-monthremission swiftly represents the best therapeutic aim to reduce the risk of abreakthrough seizure and subsequent negative outcomes. This will aid individualpatient risk stratification and the design of future epilepsy trials.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Parahippocampectomy as a New Surgical Approach to Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Caused By Hippocampal Sclerosis: A Pilot Randomized Comparative Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29229342,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The parahippocampal gyrus plays an important role inthe epileptogenic pathways of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy caused by hippocampalsclerosis (mTLE-HS); its resection could prevent epileptic seizures with fewercomplications. This study evaluates the initial efficacy and safety of anteriortemporal lobectomy (ATL), selective amygdalohipppocampectomy (SAH), andparahippocampectomy (PHC) surgical approaches in mTLE-HS.METHODS: A randomized comparative pilot clinical trial (2008-2011) was performed that included patients with mTLE-HS who underwent ATL, trans-T3 SAH, and trans-T3PHC. Their sociodemographic characteristics, visual field profiles, verbal andvisual memory profiles, and Engel scale outcome at baseline and at 1 and 5 years are described, using descriptive statistics along with parametric andnonparametric tests.RESULTS: Forty-three patients with a mean age of 35.2 years (18-56 years), 65%female, were analyzed: 14 underwent PHC, 14 ATL, and 15 SAH. The followingpercentages refer to those patients who were seizure free (Engel class IA) at1-year and 5-year follow-up, respectively: 42.9% PHC, 71.4% ATL, and 60% SAH (P¾=0.304); 28.6% PHC, 50% ATL, and 53.3% SAH (P¾= 0.353).

Response to clobazam in continuous spike-wave during sleep.,/pubmed/29168169,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of clobazam treatment in reducing epileptiformdischarges and modifying neuropsychological function in continuous spike-waveduring slow wave sleep.METHOD: We performed a prospective clinical trial in patients with continuousspike-wave during sleep aged 4 to 10 years. Patients underwent neuropsychologicalassessment and overnight electroencephalographic monitoring before treatment, andsubsequent repeat assessment and overnight electroencephalographic monitoring 3months after treatment. Treatment consisted of 1mg/kg clobazam up to a maximumdose of 30mg during the first night, followed by 0.5mg/kg nightly for 3 months.RESULTS: Nine patients completed the study and had pre- andpost-neuropsychological evaluation. There was a qualitative reduction in median(p25 -p75 ) spike percentage after 3 months (72.2 [68.0-75.8] vs 32.7[4.7-81.7]). There were no marked changes in median (p25 -p75 ) IQ comparing pre-and post-clobazam treatment (80.0 [74.0-88.0] vs 80.0 [67.0-89.0]). There was aqualitative increase in Verbal IQ (83.0 [69.0-92.0] vs 95.0 [83.0-99.0]) and aqualitative decrease in Non-verbal IQ (84.0 [74.0-87.0] vs 71.0 [60.0-84.0]).INTERPRETATION: Qualitative improvements in epileptiform activity and cognitionoccurred in patients treated with clobazam for 3 months and the relationshipbetween epileptiform activity and cognitive outcome should be studied in largerstudies.WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Verbal IQ in patients with continuous spike-wave duringsleep improved following short-term treatment with clobazam. Otherneuropsychological improvements were observed, but varied by patient. Cognitiveimprovement was observed despite some worsening of epileptiform discharges.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Surgery for Drug-Resistant Epilepsy in Children.,/pubmed/29069568,"BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical treatment may improve seizures in children andadolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy, but additional data are needed fromrandomized trials.METHODS: In this single-center trial, we randomly assigned 116 patients who were 18 years of age or younger with drug-resistant epilepsy to undergo brain surgery appropriate to the underlying cause of epilepsy along with appropriate medicaltherapy (surgery group, 57 patients) or to receive medical therapy alone(medical-therapy group, 59 patients). The patients in the medical-therapy groupwere assigned to a waiting list for surgery. The primary outcome was freedom fromseizures at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Hague SeizureSeverity scale, the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient, the social quotient on theVineland Social Maturity Scale, and scores on the Child Behavior Checklist andthe Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.RESULTS: At 12 months, freedom from seizures occurred in 44 patients (77%) in thesurgery group and in 4 (7%) in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001). Between-groupdifferences in the change from baseline to 12 months significantly favoredsurgery with respect to the score on the Hague Seizure Severity scale(difference, 19.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8 to 23.1; P<0.001), on theChild Behavior Checklist (difference, 13.1; 95% CI, 10.7 to 15.6; P<0.001), onthe Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (difference, 21.9; 95% CI, 16.4 to 27.6; P<0.001), and on the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (difference, 4.7; 95% CI, 0.4to 9.1; P=0.03), but not on the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient (difference,2.5; 95% CI, -0.1 to 5.1; P=0.06). Serious adverse events occurred in 19 patients(33%) in the surgery group, including hemiparesis in 15 (26%).CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center trial, children and adolescents withdrug-resistant epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery had a significantlyhigher rate of freedom from seizures and better scores with respect to behaviorand quality of life than did those who continued medical therapy alone at 12months.

Intracerebral stimulation of left and right ventral temporal cortex during object naming.,/pubmed/29024845,"hile object naming is traditionally considered asa left hemisphere function,neuroimaging studies have reported activations related to naming in the ventraltemporal cortex (VTC) bilaterally. Our aim was to use intracerebral electricalstimulation to specifically compare left and right VTC in naming. In twenty-threeepileptic patients tested for visual object naming during stimulation, theproportion of naming impairments was significantly higher in the left than in theright VTC (31.3% vs 13.6%). The highest proportions of positive naming sites werefound in the left fusiform gyrus and occipito-temporal sulcus (47.5% and 31.8%). For 17 positive left naming sites, an additional semantic picture matching wascarried out, always successfully performed. Our results showed the enhanced role of the left compared to the right VTC in naming and suggest that it may beinvolved in lexical retrieval rather than in semantic processing.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of everolimus on renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.,/pubmed/28993887,"BACKGROUND: Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often have multipleTSC-associated hamartomas, particularly in the brain and kidney.METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of pediatric patients being treated forsubependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) during the phase 3, randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled EXIST-1 trial. Patients were initially randomly assigned to receive everolimus 4.5 mg/m2/day (target blood trough 5-15 mg/dl) or placebo and could continue in an open-label extension phase. Angiomyolipomaresponse rates were analyzed in patients aged <18 years with _1 targetangiomyolipoma lesion at baseline. Response was defined as the proportion ofpatients with a _50% reduction in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomatafrom baseline, in the absence of new target angiomyolipomata, a >20% increase in kidney volume from nadir, and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding _ grade 2.Tolerability was also assessed.RESULTS: Overall, this analysis included 33 patients. Renal angiomyolipomaresponse was achieved by 75.8% of patients (95% confidence interval, 57.7-88.9%),with sustained mean reductions in renal angiomyolipoma volume over nearly 4 yearsof treatment. In addition, most (_80%) achieved clinically relevant reductions inangiomyolipoma volume (_50%), beginning at week 24 and continuing for theremainder of the study. Everolimus was generally well tolerated in this subgroup,with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 in severity.CONCLUSIONS: Although everolimus is currently not indicated for this use, thisanalysis from EXIST-1 demonstrates its long-term efficacy and safety for thetreatment of renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients undergoing treatment for TSC-associated SEGA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Methylphenidate, cognition, and epilepsy: A 1-month open-label trial.",/pubmed/28990169,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive difficulties are common in epilepsy. Beyond reducingseizures and adjusting antiepileptic medications, no well-validated treatmentexists in adults. Methylphenidate is used effectively in children with epilepsyand attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its effects in adults have not been systematically evaluated. We hypothesized that methylphenidate can safelyimprove cognition in adults with epilepsy. We detail here the open-labelfollow-up to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study.METHODS: Thirty epilepsy patients entered a 1-month open-label methylphenidatetrial after a double-blind phase. Doses were titrated according to clinicalpractice and patient tolerance, ranging 20-40¾mg/day. Primary measures included: Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and Medical College of Georgia Memory Test (MCG). Secondary measures were: BeckDepression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory, ApathyEvaluation Scale (AES), Stimulant Side-Effect Checklist, Adverse Events Profile, Quality of Life in Epilepsy-89 (QOLIE-89), and seizure frequency. Fourteenhealthy, nonmedicated controls were tested concurrently.RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants with epilepsy (13 men/15 women) completed the trial. Withdrawals occurred due to anxiety (n¾=¾1) and fatigue (n¾=¾1). Mean age was 36.4 years (range¾=¾20-60). Epilepsy types were: focal (n¾=¾21), generalized (n¾=¾6), or unclassified (n¾=¾1). Mean epilepsy duration¾was¾12.3¾years. Meanbaseline seizure frequency¾was¾2.8/month. There were significant improvements on methylphenidate for SDMT, MCG, CPT (the ability to discriminate between targetsand nontargets [d'] hits, hit reaction time standard deviation, omissions, andcommissions), and QOLIE subscales (energy/fatigue, attention/concentration,memory, and language; paired t tests; p¾_¾0.002). BDI-II and additional subscalesalso improved, at a lower level of statistical significance. Effect sizes weremoderate to large. Comparisons with untreated controls (n¾=¾14) revealed greater improvement for epilepsy patients on omissions and commissions, with improvement trends on d' and hits. Seizure frequency did not increase with methylphenidatetreatment (2.8/month vs. 2.4/month).SIGNIFICANCE: Methylphenidate may be an effective and safe option for improvingcognition and quality of life in epilepsy. Larger and longer double-blind,placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of brivaracetam efficacy as monotherapy in adult patients with focal seizures.,/pubmed/28982069,"Brivaracetam is a selective, high-affinity ligand for synaptic vesicle protein2A, recently approved as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of focal(partial-onset) seizures in patients 16 years of age and older with epilepsy. Thegoal of the present analysis was to determine if the dose-response ofbrivaracetam as monotherapy would fall within the range associated withbrivaracetam efficacy as adjunctive therapy. An existing brivaracetam population pharmacokinetic model consisting of first-order absorption, single compartmentdistribution, and first-order elimination components was extended by estimatingthe clearance changes due to co-administration of 12 widely prescribed AEDs. Datafor the population pharmacokinetic analysis originated from three Phase IIIadd-on trials and two terminated Phase III monotherapy trials. An existingpopulation model of daily seizure rate versus brivaracetam daily averageconcentration was applied to the data from the three add-on trials. Simulationsallowed the assessment of the combined impact of covariate effects on both thepharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of brivaracetam, and indicated that in the absence of other AEDs, only marginal changes in the overall dose-responserelationship would be expected. This suggests that brivaracetam can be used asmonotherapy without dose modifications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures using surface electromyographic monitoring.,/pubmed/28980702,"OBJECTIVE: A prospective multicenter phase III trial was undertaken to evaluatethe performance and tolerability in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) of aninvestigational wearable surface electromyographic (sEMG) monitoring system forthe detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs).METHODS: One hundred ninety-nine patients with a history of GTCSs who wereadmitted to the EMU in 11 level IV epilepsy centers for clinically indicatedvideo-electroencephalographic monitoring also received sEMG monitoring with awearable device that was worn on the arm over the biceps muscle. All recordedsEMG data were processed at a central site using a previously developed detectionalgorithm. Detected GTCSs were compared to events verified by a majority of threeexpert reviewers.RESULTS: For all subjects, the detection algorithm detected 35 of 46 (76%, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 0.61-0.87) of the GTCSs, with a positive predictivevalue (PPV) of 0.03 and a mean false alarm rate (FAR) of 2.52 per 24¾h. For data recorded while the device was placed over the midline of the biceps muscle, thesystem detected 29 of 29 GTCSs (100%, 95% CI = 0.88-1.00), with a detection delayaveraging 7.70¾s, a PPV of 6.2%, and a mean FAR of 1.44 per 24¾h. Mild tomoderate adverse events were reported in 28% (55 of 199) of subjects and led tostudy withdrawal in 9% (17 of 199). These adverse events consisted mostly of skinirritation caused by the electrode patch that resolved without treatment. Noserious adverse events were reported.SIGNIFICANCE: Detection of GTCSs using an sEMG monitoring device on the biceps isfeasible. Proper positioning of this device is important for accuracy, and forsome patients, minimizing the number of false positives may be challenging.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A randomized prospective pilot trial of Web-delivered epilepsy stigma reduction communications in young adults.,/pubmed/28960283,"OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that is often associatedwith stigmatizing attitudes and negative stereotypes among the general public.This randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested two new communication approachestargeting epilepsy stigma versus an education-alone approach.METHODS: Two brief stigma-reduction videos were developed, informed by community stakeholder input; one highlighted role competency in people with epilepsy; theother highlighted social inclusion of people with epilepsy. A control video wasalso developed. A Web-based survey using a prospective RCT design comparedeffects of experimental videos and control on acceptability, perceived impact,epilepsy knowledge, and epilepsy stigma. Epilepsy knowledge and stigma weremeasured with the Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire (EKQ) and Attitudes andBeliefs about Living with Epilepsy (ABLE), respectively.RESULTS: A total of 295 participants completed the study. Mean age was 23.1(standard deviation = 3.27) years; 59.0% were male, and 71.4% were white.Overall, respondents felt videos impacted their epilepsy attitudes. EKQ scoreswere similar across videos, with a trend for higher knowledge in experimentalvideos versus control (p = 0.06). The role competency and control videos wereassociated with slightly better perceived impact on attitudes. There were nodifferences between videos on ABLE scores (p = 0.568). There were subgroupdifferences suggesting that men, younger individuals, whites, and those withpersonal epilepsy experience had more stigmatizing attitudes.SIGNIFICANCE: This RCT tested communication strategies to improve knowledge andattitudes about epilepsy. Although this initial effort will require follow-up, wehave demonstrated the acceptability, feasibility, and potential of novelcommunication strategies to target epilepsy stigma, and a Web-based approach for assessing them.",RCT,,,,Two brief stigma-reduction videos,control video,,,Epilepsy,Epilepsy knowledge and stigma,
Real-world data on rufinamide treatment in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Results from a European noninterventional registry study.,/pubmed/28927712,"INTRODUCTION: Rufinamide is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizuresassociated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged _4years. Theobjective of this study was to provide real-world, long-term data on patientswith LGS initiating rufinamide as add-on therapy and patients with LGS receiving other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).METHODS: A Phase IV, noninterventional, multicenter registry study was conducted in patients with LGS aged _4years requiring modification to any AED treatment,including initiation of add-on rufinamide therapy. Safety/tolerability wasassessed by evaluating treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and efficacywas assessed using a generic seizure frequency scale.RESULTS: A total of 111 patients from 64 sites in 8 European countries wereincluded, of whom 64 initiated rufinamide (""rufinamide"" group) and 21 did notreceive rufinamide at any time during the study (""no-rufinamide"" group). Meanages were 16.1years (rufinamide) and 15.0years (no rufinamide). The medianduration of follow-up was >2years (range: 1.3-46.4months). Antiepilepticdrug-related TEAEs were reported for 40.6% (rufinamide) and 33.3% (no rufinamide)of patients and led to discontinuation of 7.8% and 4.8%, respectively.

Comparison of background EEG activity of different groups of patients with idiopathic epilepsy using Shannon spectral entropy and cluster-based permutation statistical testing.,/pubmed/28922360,"Idiopathic epilepsy is characterized by generalized seizures with no apparentcause. One of its main problems is the lack of biomarkers to monitor theevolution of patients. The only tools they can use are limited to inspecting the amount of seizures during previous periods of time and assessing the existence ofinterictal discharges. As a result, there is a need for improving the tools toassist the diagnosis and follow up of these patients. The goal of the presentstudy is to compare and find a way to differentiate between two groups ofpatients suffering from idiopathic epilepsy, one group that could be followed-up by means of specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures (intercriticalactivity present), and another one that could not due to the absence of thesemarkers. To do that, we analyzed the background EEG activity of each in theabsence of seizures and epileptic intercritical activity. We used the Shannonspectral entropy (SSE) as a metric to discriminate between the two groups andperformed permutation-based statistical tests to detect the set of frequenciesthat show significant differences. By constraining the spectral entropyestimation to the [6.25-12.89) Hz range, we detect statistical differences (atbelow 0.05 alpha-level) between both types of epileptic patients at all availablerecording channels. Interestingly, entropy values follow a trend that isinversely related to the elapsed time from the last seizure. Indeed, this trendshows asymptotical convergence to the SSE values measured in a group of healthysubjects, which present SSE values lower than any of the two groups of patients. All these results suggest that the SSE, measured in a specific range offrequencies, could serve to follow up the evolution of patients suffering fromidiopathic epilepsy. Future studies remain to be conducted in order to assess thepredictive value of this approach for the anticipation of seizures.",N,,,,,,,,,,

A randomised controlled cross-over double-blind pilot study protocol on THC:CBD oromucosal spray efficacy as an add-on therapy for post-stroke spasticity.,/pubmed/28882919,"INTRODUCTION: Stroke is the most disabling neurological disorder and often causesspasticity. Transmucosal cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol(THC:CBD), Sativex) is currently available to treat spasticity-associatedsymptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. Cannabinoids are being considereduseful also in the treatment of pain, nausea and epilepsy, but may bear andincreased risk for cardiovascular events. Spasticity is often assessed withsubjective and clinical rating scales, which are unable to measure the increased excitability of the monosynaptic reflex, considered the hallmark of spasticity.The neurophysiological assessment of the stretch reflex provides a precise andobjective method to measure spasticity. We propose a novel study to understand ifSativex could be useful in reducing spasticity in stroke survivors andinvestigating tolerability and safety by accurate cardiovascular monitoring.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 50 patients with spasticity followingstroke to take THC:CBD in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study.Spasticity will be assessed with a numeric rating scale for spasticity, themodified Ashworth scale and with the electromyographical recording of the stretchreflex. The cardiovascular risk will be assessed prior to inclusion. Bloodpressure, heart rate, number of daily spasms, bladder function, sleep disruption and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. A mixed-model analysisof variance will be used to compare the stretch reflex amplitude between the timepoints; semiquantitative measures will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test(THC:CBD vs placebo) and Wilcoxon test (baseline vs treatment).ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was registered on the EudraCT database withnumber 2016-001034-10 and approved by both the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) and local Ethics Committee 'Comitato Etico Regionale della Liguria'.

Wake up to sleep: The effects of lacosamide on daytime sleepiness in adults with epilepsy.,/pubmed/28866338,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects oflacosamide (LCM) on daytime sleepiness ascertained by the Epworth SleepinessScale (ESS) in adults with focal epilepsy in a randomized, controlled design.METHODS: Subjects taking _2 AEDs for _4weeks underwent polysomnography with EEGfollowed by the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and completed the ESS andother patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline, LCM 200mg/day, and LCM400mg/day (Visit 4; V4). Primary endpoint was ESS change (V4 to baseline) betweenLCM and placebo. Noninferiority test on ESS used a one-sided t-test based on ahypothesized difference of 4-point change between groups. Superiority test used atwo-sided t-test to investigate the difference in change in PROs and MWT meansleep latency (MSL) between groups. Fifty-five subjects provided 80% power toshow noninferiority of LCM assuming 10% dropout.RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (mean age: 43.5±13.2years, 69% female, median monthlyseizure frequency: 1 [0, 4.0]) participated. Baseline group characteristicsincluding age, sex, ethnicity, standardized AED dose, seizure frequency, and ESS were similar.

When patients with EPC wereexcluded, both STESS and mSTESS scores of the patients correlated with poorerlong-term outcomes (p=0.025 and 0.017, respectively). The patients with _64points in the Epidemiology-based Mortality in SE-Etiology, age, comorbidity, EEG (EMSE-EACE) score and those with _27 points in EMSE-Etiology, age, comorbidity(EMSE-EAC) score did not have poorer outcomes in the short term (p=0.06 and0.274, respectively) while they had significantly poorer outcome in the long term(p<0.001 and 0.002, respectively). In subgroup analysis, patients with CSE with_64 points in EMSE-EACE had significantly poorer outcome in the both short- andlong term (p=0.014 and 0.012, respectively), and patients with CSE with _27points in EMSE-EAC had significantly poorer outcome in the long term (p=0.03) butnot in the short term (p=0.186). Outcomes did not correlate with EMSE scores inpatients with NCSE and EPC. Status epilepticus was terminated with intravenous(IV) levetiracetam (LEV) in 68.75% of patients and with IV phenytoin (PHT) in83.3% of patients. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of efficacy (p=0.334).CONCLUSION: Being aged _65years predicts poor short-term outcomes, and havingpotentially fatal etiology predicts poor long-term outcomes, which highlight the importance of SE treatment management in the elderly. Both STESS and mSTESS arenot predictive for poor outcomes in EPC. Excluding patients with EPC, STESS, and mSTESS could predict poor long-term outcomes but not in the short term in SE.Epidemiology-based Mortality in Status Epilepticus score could predict pooroutcome in the long term better than STESS and mSTESS. Specifically, EMSE scores correlated with poor outcome in patients with CSE but not with NCSE and EPC. New scales are needed to predict outcome especially in patients with NCSE and EPC.The presence of PEDs in EEG is a predictor of RSE, and EMSE score can also beused to predict RSE. There was no difference in the efficacy of IV LEV and IV PHTin SE. This study is significant for having one of the longest follow-up periods in the literature.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Can Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison Methods Mitigate Placebo Response Differences Among Patient Populations in Adjunctive Trials of Brivaracetam and Levetiracetam?,/pubmed/28856580,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with focal seizures recruited into adjunctive antiepileptic drug (AED) trials have become more refractory and severe over time;concurrently, placebo responses have increased. To attempt to account forheterogeneity among trials, propensity-score weighted patient-level data wereused to indirectly compare placebo responses reported in brivaracetam andlevetiracetam trials.METHODS: Patient-level data from randomised, placebo-controlled brivaracetam(recruited 2007-2014) and levetiracetam (1993-1998) trials were pooled.Consistent inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and outcomes were definedconsistently. Potentially confounding baseline characteristics were adjusted for using propensity score weighting. Weighting success was assessed using placeboresponse.RESULTS: In total, 707 and 473 active drug and 399 and 253 placebo patientscomprised the brivaracetam and levetiracetam groups, respectively. Beforeweighting, several baseline variables were significantly different betweengroups; after weighting, prior vagal nerve stimulation, co-morbid depression and co-morbid anxiety remained different. Before weighting, median seizure frequency reduction was 21.7 and 3.9% in the brivaracetam and levetiracetam placebo arms,respectively; after weighting, median reduction was 15.0 and 6.0%. The comparisonof non-randomised groups could be biased by unobserved confounding factors andregion of residence. Lifetime AED history was unavailable in the brivaracetamtrials and excluded from analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Placebo responses remained different between brivaracetam andlevetiracetam trials after propensity score weighting, indicating the presence ofresidual confounding factors associated with placebo response in these trials. Ittherefore remains problematic to conduct reliable indirect comparisons ofbrivaracetam and levetiracetam given the current evidence base, which may applyto comparisons between other AED trials.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Increased rates of intermittent rhythmic delta and theta activity in the electroencephalographies of adult patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,/pubmed/28830028,"INTRODUCTION: Adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonneurodevelopmental disorder. In subgroups of patients with a (para)epilepticpathomechanism, this might be due to intermittent rhythmic delta or thetaactivity (IRDA/IRTA).PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Using a fully data-driven analysis, we compared theIRDA/IRTA rates in the resting electroencephalography (EEG) results of 97 adultpatients with ADHD and 30 control subjects. The IRDA/IRTA rates beforehyperventilation (HV) and for HV difference (difference between IRDA/IRTA rateafter and before HV) were compared between groups using a linear model.RESULTS: We detected significantly increased rates of IRDA/IRTA before HV(F=4.209, p=0.042) in patients with ADHD but no significant difference betweenthe groups for HV-difference (F=2.46, p=0.119).DISCUSSION: The increased IRDA/IRTA rates before HV in the group with ADHD might lead to (para)epileptic short-term effects (e.g., impulsivity) via local areanetwork inhibition, and to long-term effects (e.g., cognitive deficits) viaconnectivistic brain restructuring.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The role of melatonin to attain electroencephalograms in children in a sub-Saharan African setting.,/pubmed/28826048,"PURPOSE: Limited access to electroencephalograms (EEGs) in sub-Saharan Africaresults in a high patient load attending the few neurophysiology units. The stateof sleep in children improves yield and reduces artefact of EEGs. Melatonininduces ""natural sleep"" without the risk of airway compromise. This studyevaluated the effectiveness of oral melatonin to attain electroencephalograms in South African children.METHOD: Children undergoing EEG who were unable to cooperate or required sleepEEG, received oral melatonin (3mg<15kg; 6mg>15kg). A retrospective control group received chloral hydrate. Outcome measures were the proportion of children whoslept, useful EEG study data, sleep latency and duration, artefacts and EEG studyabnormalities.RESULTS: 173 children were recruited, 88 (51%) male, median age 4 years 9 months (range 0-14 years). 87% achieved stage 2 sleep. Median sleep latency was 44.5min and duration of sleep was 25min (range 18.5-29min). Children had no post-sedationirritability, persistent drowsiness, nor any other adverse events or defermentsfor inter-current illnesses. Sedation with melatonin was less successful inchildren with developmental and behavioural problems (_2=6.18, P=0.046), with ahigher rate of artefacts (_2=5.83, P=0.05). 33.5% (n=58) had abnormal EEGstudies, which was comparable to a historical cohort sedated with chloral hydrate(45.5%) (_2=1.22, P=1.27).

Efficacy of single or combined midodrine and pyridostigmine in orthostatic hypotension.,/pubmed/28794253,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term (for up to 3 months) efficacy and safety of single or combined therapy with midodrine and pyridostigmine for neurogenicorthostatic hypotension (OH).METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label clinical trial. In total, 87 patients with symptomatic neurogenic OH were enrolled and randomized to receive 1 of 3treatments: midodrine only, pyridostigmine only, or midodrine + pyridostigmine.The patients were followed up at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The primaryoutcome measures were improvement in orthostatic blood pressure (BP) drop at 3months. Secondary endpoints were improvement of the orthostatic BP drop at 1month and amelioration of the questionnaire score evaluating OH-associatedsymptoms.RESULTS: Orthostatic systolic and diastolic BP drops improved significantly at 3 months after treatment in all treatment groups. Orthostatic symptoms weresignificantly ameliorated during the 3-month treatment, and the symptom severity was as follows: midodrine only < midodrine + pyridostigmine < pyridostigmine onlygroup. Mild to moderate adverse events were reported by 11.5% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Single or combination treatment with midodrine and pyridostigminewas effective and safe in patients with OH for up to 3 months.

Everolimus long-term use in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: Four-year update of the EXIST-2 study.,/pubmed/28792952,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the long-term effects of everolimus in patients withrenal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadiclymphangioleiomyomatosis.METHODS: Following favorable results from the double-blind core phase of EXIST-2 (NCT00790400), patients were allowed to receive open-label everolimus (extension phase). Patients initially randomly assigned to everolimus continued on the same dose; those who were receiving placebo crossed over to everolimus 10 mg/day. Dosemodifications were based on tolerability. The primary end point wasangiomyolipoma response rate, defined as a _50% reduction from baseline in thesum volume of target renal angiomyolipomas in the absence of new targetangiomyolipomas, kidney volume increase of >20% from nadir, andangiomyolipoma-related bleeding grade _2. The key secondary end point was safety.RESULTS: Of the 112 patients who received _1 dose of everolimus, 58% (95% CI,48.3% to 67.3%) achieved angiomyolipoma response. Almost all patients (97%)experienced reduction in renal lesion volumes at some point during the studyperiod. Median duration of everolimus exposure was 46.9 months. Sixteen (14.3%)patients experienced angiomyolipoma progression at some point in the study. Noangiomyolipoma-related bleeding or nephrectomies were reported. One patient oneverolimus underwent embolization for worsening right flank pain. Subependymalgiant cell astrocytoma lesion response was achieved in 48% of patients and skinlesion response in 68% of patients. The most common adverse events suspected tobe treatment-related were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia (30.4%), acne(25.9%), aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (each 21.4%). Ten (8.9%)patients withdrew because of an adverse event. Renal function remained stable,and the frequency of emergent adverse events generally decreased over time.CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus treatment remained safe and effective over approximately 4 years. The overall risk/benefit assessment supports the use of everolimus as a viable treatment option for angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosiscomplex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00790400.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Variability of Creatine Metabolism Genes in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,/pubmed/28758966,"Creatine deficiency syndrome (CDS) comprises three separate enzyme deficiencieswith overlapping clinical presentations: arginine:glycine amidinotransferase(GATM gene, glycine amidinotransferase), guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMTgene), and creatine transporter deficiency (SLC6A8 gene, solute carrier family 6 member 8). CDS presents with developmental delays/regression, intellectualdisability, speech and language impairment, autistic behaviour, epilepticseizures, treatment-refractory epilepsy, and extrapyramidal movement disorders;symptoms that are also evident in children with autism. The objective of thestudy was to test the hypothesis that genetic variability in creatine metabolism genes is associated with autism. We sequenced GATM, GAMT and SLC6A8 genes in 166 patients with autism (coding sequence, introns and adjacent untranslatedregions). A total of 29, 16 and 25 variants were identified in each gene,respectively. Four variants were novel in GATM, and 5 in SLC6A8 (not present inthe 1000 Genomes, Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) or Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) databases). A single variant in each gene was identified asnon-synonymous, and computationally predicted to be potentially damaging. Ninevariants in GATM were shown to have a lower minor allele frequency (MAF) in theautism population than in the 1000 Genomes database, specifically in the EastAsian population (Fisher's exact test). Two variants also had lower MAFs in theEuropean population. In summary, there were no apparent associations of variants in GAMT and SLC6A8 genes with autism. The data implying there could be a lowerassociation of some specific GATM gene variants with autism is an observationthat would need to be corroborated in a larger group of autism patients, and withsub-populations of Asian ethnicities. Overall, our findings suggest that thegenetic variability of creatine synthesis/transport is unlikely to play a part inthe pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Seizure outcome after hippocampal deep brain stimulation in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy: A prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blind study.",/pubmed/28744855,"OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of hippocampal deep brain stimulation (Hip-DBS) inpatients with refractory temporary lobe epilepsy (TLE).METHODS: Sixteen adult patients with refractory TLE were studied. Patient'sworkup included medical history, interictal and ictal electroencephalography(EEG), and high-resolution 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients wererandomized on a 1:1 proportion to an active (stimulation on) or to a control (no stimulation) arm. After implantation, patients were allowed to recover for 1month, which was followed by a 1-month titration (or sham) period. The 6-monthblinded phase started immediately afterward. A postoperative MRI confirmed theelectrode's position in all patients. All patients received bipolar continuousstimulation. Stimulus duration was 300 _s and frequency was 130 Hz; finalintensity was 2 V. Patients were considered responders when they had at least 50%seizure frequency reduction.RESULTS: All patients had focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS, complexpartial seizures), and 87% had focal aware seizures (FAS, simple partialseizures). Mean preoperative seizure frequency was 12.5 ± 9.4 (mean ± standarddeviation) per month. MRI findings were normal in two patients, disclosedbilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) in three, left MTS in five, and rightMTS in six patients. An insertional effect could be noted in both control andactive patients. In the active group (n = 8), four patients became seizure-free; seven of eight were considered responders and one was a nonresponder. There was asignificant difference regarding FIAS frequency between the two groups from thefirst month of full stimulation (p < 0.001) until the end of the blinded phase (p< 0.001). This was also true for FAS, except for the third month of the blindedphase.SIGNIFICANCE: Hip-DBS was effective in significantly reducing seizure frequencyin patients with refractory TLE in the active group, as compared to the controlgroup. Fifty-percent of the patients in the active group became seizure-free.

The ketogenic diet in patients with myoclonic status in non-progressive encephalopathy.,/pubmed/28743048,"Myoclonic status in non-progressive encephalopathy (MSNPE) is characterized bythe recurrence of long-lasting atypical status epilepticus associated withattention impairment and continuous polymorphous jerks, mixed with other complex abnormal movements, in infants suffering from a non-progressive encephalopathy.The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as an alternative to antiepileptic drugs(AEDs) for patients with refractory epileptic encephalopathies.PURPOSE: In thisstudy we assess the efficacy and tolerability of the KD in patients with MSNPE.METHODS: Between March 1, 1980 and August 31, 2013, 99 patients who met thediagnostic criteria of MSNPE were seen (58 patients in Verona and 41 patients in Buenos Aires). Six of these 99 patients were placed on the KD using the Hopkinsprotocol and followed for a minimum period of 24 months.RESULTS: Twelve months after initiating the diet, three patients had a 75%-99%decrease in seizures, two had a 50%-74% decrease in seizures, and the remainingchild had a less than 50% seizure reduction. In five patients with a seizurereduction of more than 50%, the myoclonic status epilepticus disappeared within 6months after starting the diet. All patients had very good tolerability and noadverse events were identified.

This study compared the cognitive and mood effects of LEV toplacebo in healthy older adults.METHODS: Cognitive, mood, and balance variables were compared between LEV andplacebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study withtwo 5-week treatment periods. Healthy volunteers (n = 20) aged 65-80 (mean age72.4) received either LEV or placebo in which the LEV target dose was 1,000mg/day. Volunteers, aged 65-80, were without epilepsy to limit potentiallyconfounding the impact of seizures and/or underlying neuropathology on outcomes. LEV was initiated at 250 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, then increased to 500 mgtwice a day for 2 weeks, and then tapered to 250 mg twice a day for 1 week. This was randomized with placebo for the two treatment arms. Measures includedstandardized neuropsychological, mood, and balance tests yielding 32 variables.Balance was assessed using subjective report (e.g., A-B neurotoxicity scale) and objective data (e.g., Berg Balance Scale).RESULTS: Average LEV serum concentration was 16.9 (standard deviation [SD} 7.7). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no differences between LEVand placebo phases for 29 (90.6%) of 32 variables including no change in balance.Performance on LEV was better than placebo on a visual memory (MCG Complex FigureRecall; p = 0.007) and two attention tests (Trail Making Test, Part A, p = 0.009;Stroop Interference, p = 0.004). There was a trend for greater irritability andfatigue (POMS Anger and Fatigue) during the LEV phase (p = 0.029, p = 0.035).Effect-size changes were generally small (Cohen d < 0.5).SIGNIFICANCE: LEV was well tolerated in this elderly population in terms ofcognition, mood, and balance.

Pretreatment seizure semiology in childhood absence epilepsy.,/pubmed/28724582,"OBJECTIVE: To determine seizure semiology in children with newly diagnosedchildhood absence epilepsy and to evaluate associations with short-term treatmentoutcomes.METHODS: For participants enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,comparative-effectiveness trial, semiologic features of pretreatment seizureswere analyzed as predictors of treatment outcome at the week 16 to 20 visit.RESULTS: Video of 1,932 electrographic absence seizures from 416 participants wasevaluated. Median seizure duration was 10.2 seconds; median time betweenelectrographic seizure onset and clinical manifestation onset was 1.5 seconds.For individual seizures and by participant, the most common semiology featureswere pause/stare (seizure 95.5%, participant 99.3%), motor automatisms (60.6%,86.1%), and eye involvement (54.9%, 76.5%). The interrater agreement for motorautomatisms and eye involvement was good (72%-84%). Variability of semiologyfeatures between seizures even within participants was high. Clustering analyses revealed 4 patterns (involving the presence/absence of eye involvement and motor automatisms superimposed on the nearly ubiquitous pause/stare). Most participantsexperienced more than one seizure cluster pattern. No individual semiologicfeature was individually predictive of short-term outcome. Seizure freedom washalf as likely in participants with one or more seizure having the pattern of eyeinvolvement without motor automatisms than in participants without this pattern.CONCLUSIONS: Almost all absence seizures are characterized by a pause in activityor staring, but rarely is this the only feature. Semiologic features tend tocluster, resulting in identifiable absence seizure subtypes with significantintraparticipant seizure phenomenologic heterogeneity. One seizure subtype,pause/stare and eye involvement but no motor automatisms, is specificallyassociated with a worse treatment outcome.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of propofol and dexmedetomidine infused overnight to treat hyperactive and mixed ICU delirium: a protocol for the Basel ProDex clinical trial.,/pubmed/28710219,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a neurobehavioural disturbance that frequentlydevelops particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU) population. It was firstdescribed more than half a century ago, where it was already discovered as astate that might come along with serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. However, in most cases, there is still lack of proof for causal relationship. Its presencefrequently remains unrecognised due to suggested predominance of the hypoactiveform. Furthermore, in the general ICU population, it has been shown that theduration of delirium is associated with worse long-term cognitive function. Dueto the multifactorial origin of delirium, we have several but no incontestabletreatment options. Nonetheless, delirium bears a high burden for patient, family members and the medical care team.The Basel ProDex Study targets improvement ofhyperactive and mixed delirium therapy in critically ill patients. We will focus on reducing the duration and severity of delirium by implementing dexmedetomidineinto the treatment plan. Dexmedetomidine compared with other sedatives showsfewer side effects representing a better risk profile for delirium treatment ingeneral. This could further contribute to higher patient safety.The aim of theBaProDex Trial is to assess the superiority of dexmedetomidine to propofol fortreatment of hyperactive and mixed delirium in the ICU. We hypothesise thatdexmedetomidine, compared with propofol administered at night, shortens both the duration and severity of delirium.METHODS/DESIGN: The Basel ProDex Study is an investigator-initiated,one-institutional, two-centre randomised controlled clinical trial for thetreatment of delirium with dexmedetomidine versus propofol in 316 critically ill patients suffering from hyperactive and mixed delirium. The primary outcomemeasure is delirium duration in hours. Secondary outcomes include delirium-freedays at day 28, death at day 28, delirium severity, amount of ventilator days,amount of rescue sedation with haloperidol, length of ICU and hospital stay, and pharmaceutical economic analysis of the treatments. Sample size was estimated to be able to show the superiority of dexmedetomidine compared with propofolregarding the duration of delirium in hours. The trial will be externallymonitored according to good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. There are nointerim analyses planned for this trial.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted in compliance with theprotocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the InternationalConference on Harmonization- Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) or Europ_ische NormInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO EN 14155; as far asapplicable) as well as all national legal and regulatory requirements. Only thestudy team will have access to trial specific data. Anonymisation will beachieved by a unique patient identification code.

We conducted amulticentre retrospective and prospective study that included 33 haemophiliacentres from 20 countries. Inclusion criteria were children and adolescents born between 1993 and 2014, with severe haemophilia A or B without inhibitors.Participants were categorized by prophylaxis regimen: full, partial or none,based on dose and dose frequency of regular infusions. The cohort study included 1515 children: 29 cases of ICH over 8038 patient years were reported.

Risk of a seizure recurrence after a breakthrough seizure and the implications for driving: further analysis of the standard versus new antiepileptic drugs (SANAD) randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/28698335,"BJECTIVES: A breakthrough seizure is one occurring after at least 12 monthsseizure freedom while on treatment. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency(DVLA) allows an individual to return to driving once they have been seizure freefor 12 months following a breakthrough seizure. This is based on the assumptionthat the risk of a further seizure in the next 12 months has dropped <20%. Thisanalysis considers whether the prescribed 1 year off driving following abreakthrough seizure is sufficient for this and stratifies risk according toclinical characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS AND MAINOUTCOME MEASURES: The multicentre UK-based Standard versus New AntiepilepticDrugs (SANAD) study was a randomised controlled trial assessing standard and new antiepileptic drugs for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For participants aged at least 16 with a breakthrough seizure, data have been analysed to estimatethe annual seizure recurrence risk following a period of 6, 9 and 12 monthsseizure freedom. Regression modelling was used to investigate how antiepilepticdrug treatment and a number of clinical factors influence the risk of seizurerecurrence.RESULTS: At 12 months following a breakthrough seizure, the overall unadjustedrisk of a recurrence over the next 12 months is lower than 20%, risk 17% (95% CI 15% to 19%). However, some patient subgroups have been identified which have anannual recurrence risk significantly greater than 20% after an initial 12-monthseizure-free period following a breakthrough seizure.CONCLUSIONS: This reanalysis of SANAD provides estimates of seizure recurrencerisks following a breakthrough seizure that will inform policy and guidance aboutregaining an ordinary driving licence. Further guidance is needed as to how such data should be used.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: SANAD is registered with the International StandardRandomised Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN38354748.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Implementation fidelity of a self-management course for epilepsy: method and assessment.,/pubmed/28697723,"BACKGROUND: Complex interventions such as self-management courses are difficultto evaluate due to the many interacting components. The way complex interventionsare delivered can influence the effect they have for patients, and can impact theinterpretation of outcomes of clinical trials. Implementation fidelity evaluates whether complex interventions are delivered according to protocol. Suchassessments have been used for one-to-one psychological interventions; however,the science is still developing for group interventions.METHODS: We developed and tested an instrument to measure implementation fidelityof a two-day self-management course for people with epilepsy, SMILE(UK). Usingaudio recordings, we looked at adherence and competence of course facilitators.Adherence was assessed by checklists. Competence was measured by scoring groupinteraction, an overall impression score and facilitator ""didacticism"". Tomeasure ""didacticism"", we developed a novel way to calculate facilitator speechusing computer software. Using this new instrument, implementation fidelity ofSMILE(UK) was assessed on three modules of the course, for 28% of all coursesdelivered.RESULTS: Using the instrument for adherence, scores from two independent ratersshowed substantial agreement with weighted Kappa of 0.67 and high percentagreement of 81.2%. For didacticism, the results from both raters were highlycorrelated with an intraclass coefficient of 0.97 (p¾<¾0.0001). We found that thecourses were delivered with a good level of adherence (> 50% of scored itemsreceived the maximum of 2 points) and high competence. Groups were interactive(mean score: 1.9-2.0 out of 2) and the overall impression was on average assessedas ""good"". Didacticism varied from 42% to 93% of total module time and was notassociated with the other competence scores.CONCLUSION: The instrument devised to measure implementation fidelity wasreproducible and easy to use. The courses for the SMILE(UK) study were delivered with a good level of adherence to protocol while not compromising facilitatorcompetence.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN57937389 .",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neurological results of the modified treatment of epilepsy by stimulation of the vagus nerve.,/pubmed/28689344,"INTRODUCTION: The vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is used for treatment ofdrug-resistant epilepsy but laryngeal side effects are common. We tried toimprove VNS by modifying the implantation procedure. The aim was to reduce therate of side effects that have prevented using VNS to its full capacity.METHODS: We operated on 74 pediatric patients for VNS device implantation using amodified surgical protocol incorporating lower neck incision for electrodeplacement and 36 patients who were operated by standard technique were used forcontrol group. We retrospectively analyzed reduction in frequency of seizures,reduction in severity of seizures (assessed by the shortened Ictal/post-ictalsubscale of the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale that included falling to theground, postictal headache and sleepiness, incontinence, tongue biting, andinjury during attack).RESULTS: Using the new implantation technique, side effects related directly toVNS therapy occurred in six cases (8.1%) showing statistically sound improvement over the standard implantation technique (p¾_¾0.05). To achieve good results, themaximum stimulation (3.5¾mA) was used in 24 patients (32.4%), with no laryngealside effects detected. Twelve patients (16.2%) were seizure-free after the first year of VNS treatment. 74.3% of patients experienced a 50% reduction in seizurefrequency and improved ictal or postictal activity.CONCLUSION: To minimize laryngeal complications in implantation surgery for VNSdevices, the surgical technique may be modified, and lower neck incision could beused. A low rate of laryngeal side effects allows using the VNS device to itsfull electrical capacity.",N,,,Y,vagus nerve stimulation,standard technique,,,drug-resistant epilepsy,reduction in frequency of seizures,
Bioequivalence Between Generic and Branded Lamotrigine in People With Epilepsy: The EQUIGEN Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/28654954,"Importance: Switching between generic antiepileptic drugs is a highly debatedissue that affects both clinical care and overall health care costs.Objective: To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of 3 (1branded and 2 generic drugs) on-market, immediate-release lamotrigine drugproducts.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Equivalence Among Antiepileptic DrugGeneric and Brand Products in People With Epilepsy (EQUIGEN) single-dose study isa crossover, prospective, sequence-randomized, replicate pharmacokinetic studyconducted at 5 US academic epilepsy centers. Fifty adults (_18 years) withepilepsy who were taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs and not currentlyreceiving lamotrigine were enrolled between July 18, 2013, and January 19, 2015. Every participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 equivalent sequences, eachcomprising 6 study periods, during which they had blood draws before and aftermedication administration. Forty-nine participants were included inintention-to-treat analyses.Interventions: Participants received a single 25-mg dose of immediate-releaselamotrigine at the start of each period, with the branded and the 2 mostdisparate generic products each studied twice. Lamotrigine was selected as theantiepileptic drug of interest because of its wide use, publications indicatingproblems with generic switches, and complaints to the US Food and DrugAdministration regarding generic products. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to the specific generic products selected.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was bioequivalence betweenproducts. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under theconcentration-time curve (AUC) were compared, and average bioequivalence (ABE)was established if the 90% CIs of the ratios of the 2 products were withinequivalence limits (80%-125%).Results: Of the 50 randomized participants, 49 (98%) received all 3 lamotrigineproducts and completed at least 3 pharmacokinetic assessments and 46 (92%)completed all 6 pharmacokinetic assessments. Among the 49 participants, 28 (57%) were men and 21 (43%) were women, 42 (86%) self-identified as white, and 46 (16) years was the mean (SD) age. The 3 drug products were considered bioequivalentbecause the 90% CIs were within equivalence limits (lowest and highest CI limits for Cmax, 92.6% and 110.4%; for AUC0-96, 96.9% and 101.9%).

Evaluation of a self-regulation based psycho-educational pilot intervention targeting children and adolescents with epilepsy in Greece.,/pubmed/28654856,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe the development and initialevaluation of a minimal structured psycho-educational intervention for childrenand adolescents with epilepsy. The intervention aimed at increasing theunderstanding and personal control (self-management) of epilepsy, and at reducingpsychological distress, sleep problems and somatic complaints.METHOD: Twelve patients participated in our intervention and another 12, matched on age and gender, served as the control group. Data were obtained at baseline(prior to the intervention) and 3 months later in the context of an interviewbased on several validated questionnaires. The intervention was limited to one4-h session using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques, relaxationtechniques, video and storytelling. Effects of the intervention on primary andsecondary outcomes were examined using 2 (baseline, T1 vs. post-treatment, T2)_2 (intervention vs. control) mixed model repeated measures analysis of covariance(ANCOVA), controlling for epilepsy severity.RESULTS: The analysis revealed that over the three months of the study,significant main effects (group x time) were observed on coherence (F(1,21)=6.12;p=0.02) with important changes in favour of the intervention group. Significantmain effects were also observed on psychological distress levels (F(1,21)=10.08; p=0.005) and sleep problems (F(1,21)=11.40; p=0.003).CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that a brief self-regulation-basedintervention may have beneficial effects for children and adolescents sufferingfrom epilepsy by inciting improvements in coherence, psychological distress andsleep problems.",RCT,,,,minimal structured psycho-educational intervention,control,,,epilepsy,Coherence,
Identifying seizure clusters in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.,/pubmed/28641165,"The present study explored how seizure clusters may be defined for those withpsychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), a topic for which there is a paucity ofliterature. The sample was drawn from a multisite randomized clinical trial forPNES; seizure data are from participants' seizure diaries. Three possible clusterdefinitions were examined: 1) common clinical definition, where _3 seizures in a day is considered a cluster, along with two novel statistical definitions, where _3 seizures in a day are considered a cluster if the observed number of seizures statistically exceeds what would be expected relative to a patient's: 1) average seizure rate prior to the trial, 2) observed seizure rate for the previous seven days. Prevalence of clusters was 62-68% depending on cluster definition used, andoccurrence rate of clusters was 6-19% depending on cluster definition. Based onthese data, clusters seem to be common in patients with PNES, and more researchis needed to identify if clusters are related to triggers and outcomes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction between eslicarbazepine and rosuvastatin: Potential effects on xenobiotic transporters.,/pubmed/28624574,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with partial-onset seizures and comorbid cardiovasculardisease may concomitantly receive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL), an antiepilepticdrug, and rosuvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This study evaluated the effect of multiple-dose ESL on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a singledose of rosuvastatin in healthy subjects.METHODS: This was a Phase I, single-center, fixed-sequence, open-label study.Healthy subjects received two treatments, in sequence. Treatment A: a single 40mgoral dose of rosuvastatin on Day 1, followed by a washout period (Days 1-4);treatment B: titration of ESL (400-800mg once daily) on Days 5-18, followed byESL 1200mg once daily on Days 19-35, with a single dose of rosuvastatin (40mg) onDay 32. Subjects then entered a 2-week follow-up period. Plasma concentrations ofrosuvastatin were quantified for PK analyses. Safety and tolerability wereassessed throughout the study.RESULTS: Thirty-three healthy subjects were enrolled and 30 completed the study. Mean rosuvastatin (standard deviation) t1/2 was similar when rosuvastatin wasused concomitantly with ESL and when it was used alone (26.5 [16.3]h, and 22.4[9.5]h, respectively). The geometric least squares mean ratios (90% confidenceintervals) of rosuvastatin exposure levels between rosuvastatin usedconcomitantly with ESL and rosuvastatin used alone were as follows: Cmax, 64.0%(55.9-73.3%); AUC(0-Á), 63.0% (57.1-69.4%); and AUC(0-last), 60.9% (55.2-67.1%). Concomitant use of ESL and rosuvastatin was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin exposure was 36-39% lower with steady-stateadministration of ESL, potentially due to reduced oral bioavailability ofrosuvastatin. Consequently, when rosuvastatin is used with ESL, a rosuvastatindose adjustment may be necessary if a clinically significant change in lipids is noted.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cluster reduction in patients in a pilot treatment trial for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.,/pubmed/28624511,"INTRODUCTION: The present study examined seizure clusters as a primary outcome inpatients receiving treatment for PNES. Cluster reduction is examinedlongitudinally using frequency threshold and statistical definitions of seizurecluster for patients. Possible risk factors for clustering will be examined alongwith clustering as a risk factor for poorer secondary outcomes.METHODS: Participants were from a pilot randomized treatment trial for PNES wherethey received cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip),sertraline, combination therapy, or treatment as usual. Seizure data are frompatients' seizure dairies.RESULTS: Cluster reduction was observed for those receiving CBT-ip or combinationtreatment using all definitions of daily clusters and weekly clusters. No riskfactors of clustering were observed. Those who were identified as having clustersduring the trial had poorer secondary outcomes on several measures at baselinerelative to those who were not identified as having clusters.DISCUSSION: This is the first study known to the authors to not only examinedseizure clusters as a primary outcome for those with PNES, but also the firststudy to suggest that CBT-ip and combination therapy may be effective in reducingthe frequency of clusters.",RCT,,,,cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy,sertraline,combination therapy,treatment as usual,Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES),seizure clusters,
Effects of adjunctive lacosamide on mood and quality of life in patients with epilepsy.,/pubmed/28623755,"We examined the effects of adjunctive lacosamide (LCM) on mood and quality oflife (QOL) in adult patients with partial-onset seizures in a prospective,controlled, single-blind study. Patients in whom LCM was added to their AEDregimen for clinical indications comprised the LCM group (n=18), while thecontrol group (n=32) comprised patients on _2 AEDs with anticipated stable dosingfor the duration of the study. Profile of Mood States (POMS) and QOLIE-89 wereused to assess mood and QOL at enrollment and 12-16weeks later. Adherence to LCM was measured electronically with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)and using a self-report measure. There were no significant between-groupdifferences in age, AED load, side-effects (A-B Neurotoxicity Scale), MoCA mentalstatus, or seizure-related factors. LCM adherence (measured by MEMS) was 70.7%.There was a significant decrease in negative mood states in the LCM group(estimated marginal mean at baseline=49.4, at follow-up=29.7; p=0.02), aftercontrolling for seizure freedom. Based on previously reported benchmarks,clinically significant change on the POMS occurred in 7 (38%) LCM patients. Theeffect of LCM on the overall QOL was not significant (p=0.078). Correlationbetween POMS Total Mood Distress and Emotional-Wellbeing on the QOLIE-89 wassignificant (r=-0.783; p=0.01).

Imepitoin is well tolerated in healthy and epileptic cats.,/pubmed/28606140,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy in the cat is a serious medical condition. To date there areno licensed treatments for feline epilepsy and no well-controlled clinicalstudies on the efficacy or safety of antiepileptic drugs in cats. The aim of thisstudy was to collect tolerability _data_ and first exploratory efficacy data ofimepitoin in both healthy and epileptic cats.RESULTS: In two tolerability studies, 30 healthy cats received imepition twicedaily in doses of 0, 30, 40 or 80¾mg/kg bodyweight for 30¾days. No seriousadverse events were observed in any of the dose groups. In the imepitoin treated groups, emesis was observed in some animals temporarily and intermittently mainlyin the second and third weeks of treatment. In a small, single-arm, open label,uncontrolled clinical trial eight cats suffering from idiopathic epilepsy weretreated with imepitoin twice daily at doses of 30¾mg/kg bodyweight for 30¾days.Four of these cats (50%) achieved seizure freedom for at least 8¾weeks undertreatment. Adverse events, mostly lethargy, decreased appetite and emesis, wereoften mild and transient.CONCLUSION: In summary, imepitoin was well tolerated in healthy and epilepticcats and showed in a pilot trial indication for efficacy in treating felineepilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of efficacy of folic acid and silymarin in the management of antiepileptic drug induced liver injury: a randomized clinical trial.,/pubmed/28603098,"BACKGROUND: Liver injury associated with antiepileptic drugs accounts for a largeproportion of drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) in children. Although withdrawalof the causative agent is the only proved treatment for DILI, in some clinicalsituations it is not possible. Recent studies have reported promising results of using hepatoprotective drugs with antioxidant actions for the management of DILI.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of folic acid versus silymarintreatment in relation to decreasing liver enzymes in patients with DILI due toantiepileptic therapy.METHODS: This randomized, open-label, clinical trial evaluated 55 children withepilepsy who were on antiepileptic treatment and experienced DILI. The childrenwere randomized to receive either silymarin (5 mg/kg per day) or folic acid (1 mgper day) for one month and were followed up for three months.RESULTS: Liver enzymes significantly decreased in both groups. The decrease trendin alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) werestronger in the folic acid group compared to silymarin group (P=0.04 and P=0.007,respectively). At the end of the study patients in the folic acid group hadsignificantly lower ALT (P=0.04), AST (P=0.02), and gamma-glutamyl transferase(GGT) (P<0.001) levels and also higher percentage of normal ALT (30.7% vs 3.4%,P=0.009) and AST (42.3% vs 0%, P<0.001), and GGT (23.1% vs 0%, P=0.008) valuescompared to the patients in the silymarin group. No rebound elevations in ALT,AST and GGT levels or adverse reactions were noted in neither of the studygroups.CONCLUSION: Although both treatments were safe and effective in decreasing liver enzymes, folic acid seems to be superior to silymarin in the management of DILI.",RCT,,,,silymarin,folic acid,,,Children with epilepsy who were on antiepileptic treatment and experienced DILI,Liver enzymes,
Adjunctive lacosamide for focal epilepsy: an open-label trial evaluating the impact of flexible titration and dosing on safety and seizure outcomes.,/pubmed/28597842,"To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lacosamide in a real-life settingwith the use of a flexible dose titration schedule and individualised maintenancedoses up to the maximum approved dose of 400¾mg/day. Adults with a diagnosis offocal seizures, with or without secondary generalization, were enrolled in thisopen-label Phase IV trial (NCT01235403). Lacosamide was initiated at 100¾mg/day(50¾mg bid) and uptitrated over a 12-week period to 200, 300 or 400¾mg/day, basedon safety and seizure control. Although dose increases were to be in incrementsof 100¾mg/day, intermediate doses were permitted at each escalation step for one week for patients known to be particularly sensitive to starting new AEDs. After receiving a stable, effective dose for three weeks, patients entered the 12-week maintenance period. Primary outcomes were incidence of treatment-emergent adverseevents (TEAEs) and withdrawal due to TEAEs. Seizure outcomes, all secondary, weremedian focal seizure frequency, _50% reduction in focal seizure frequency, andseizure freedom. One hundred patients with a mean age of 44 years were enrolledand 74 completed the trial. The incidence of TEAEs was 64.0% (n=100), with themost frequently reported (_5% of patients) being dizziness, headache, andasthenia. Fourteen patients withdrew due to TEAEs, most frequently due todizziness (six patients; 6.0%), vomiting (two patients; 2%), and tremor (twopatients; 2%). Among patients with baseline and maintenance phase seizure data(n=75), median reduction in focal seizure frequency from baseline was 69.7% andthe _50% responder rate was 69.3%. Among 74 patients who completed themaintenance phase, 21 (28.4%) were seizure-free. Flexible lacosamide dosing inthis open-label trial was associated with a favourable tolerability and safetyprofile; the nature of the TEAEs was consistent with that observed in previouspivotal trials.

Evaluation of a Decision Aid for Women with Epilepsy Who Are Considering Pregnancy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/28590833,"BACKGROUND: For many women with epilepsy (WWE), decision making about pregnancyis complicated by considerations such as the potential teratogenicity ofantiepileptic drugs, offspring risk of epilepsy, seizure occurrence duringpregnancy, and the challenges of parenting amidst poorly controlled seizures.OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate adecision aid (DA) developed to help WWE decide if they should start or enlargetheir families.METHODS: Seventy-nine WWE of childbearing age were recruited from Epilepsy ActionAustralia between October and November 2013 and randomized to receive theintervention (the DA) or not, and to complete a set of questionnaires pre- andpost- intervention. The DA, delivered as a PDF booklet, provided balancedevidence-based information about options, risks and benefits, includingprobabilities; as well as steps for clarifying values and considering optionswithin one's personal situation.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the DA group had statisticallysignificant improvements in knowledge about pregnancy and epilepsy (Cohen's d =1.24; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.83) and reduced decisional conflict (Cohen's d = 0.59;95%CI = 0.21 to 0.99). Changes in decision self-efficacy, certainty of choice,patient-practitioner communication abilities and value congruence with choicewere comparable between the DA and control group. Importantly, women's decisions about motherhood were not biased towards either direction, and there were noadverse effects on depression or anxiety. All women who received the DA indicatedthey would recommend it to other WWE.CONCLUSIONS: The DA has the potential to serve as a useful support tool for WWEwho are considering motherhood. Future research is needed to test the DA inclinical settings with guidance from a health professional.

An economic evaluation of a multicomponent self-management intervention for adults with epilepsy (ZMILE study).,/pubmed/28589669,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this (trial-based) economic evaluation was, from asocietal perspective, to compare the cost-effectiveness of a multicomponentself-management intervention (MCI) with care as usual (CAU) in adult patientswith epilepsy over a 12-month period.METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, participants were randomized intointervention or CAU group. Adherence, self-efficacy (Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale[ESES]), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, productionlosses, and patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and during the12-month study period. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e., cost per increased adherence, self-efficacy, or QALY), and cost-effectivenessacceptability curves were calculated.RESULTS: In total, 102 patients were included in the study, of whom 52 were inthe intervention group. Adherence rates over 6 months were 63.7% for the CAUgroup and 75.9% for the intervention group. Adherence, ESES, and quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. An ICER of 54 per point increase inESES score at 6 months and 1,105 per point increase at 12-month follow-up wasfound. The intervention resulted in an ICER of 88 per percentage of adherenceincrease at 6 months. ICERs of 8,272 and 15,144 per QALY gained were found at6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: Although no statistically significant difference was found afterbaseline adjustments, cost-effectiveness estimates for MCI appear promising. Asrules of inference are arbitrary, it has been argued that decisions should bebased only on the net benefits, irrespective of whether differences arestatistically significant. Hence, the MCI may be a cost-effective addition to thecurrent standard care for adults with epilepsy.",RCT,,,,"multicomponentself-management intervention",care as usual,,,epilepsy,Adherence,
Surface EEG-Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Closed-Loop System.,/pubmed/28587498,"Conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols rely onapplying electrical current at a fixed intensity and duration without usingsurrogate markers to direct the interventions.

Written accounts of living with epilepsy: A thematic analysis.,/pubmed/28575769,"This study examines the subjective experience of living with epilepsy bythematically analyzing participants' written accounts of their condition. Writingis seen as an individual act allowing for private exploration, reflection andexpression of thoughts and feelings.

Participants were asked to produce four pieces of writing: 1) about their thoughts and feelings about their condition; 2) a letter to their condition; 3) a letter to their younger self; and 4) about a personal value. All writings were analyzed thematically using a theory- and data-driven approach.Five main-themes and 22 sub-themes emerged from the data. Theme 1: 'seizureonset' demonstrated that the development of seizures and subsequent diagnosis wasan important event that could change an individuals' identity. Theme 2: 'seizure symptoms' revealed participants externalized their seizures as an intrusive agentwith a constant presence in their lives. Theme 3: 'treatment and outcome'reflected medication as an essential means to controlling seizures withsubsequent side effects being perceived as a compromise. Theme 4: 'living withepilepsy' explored the consequences of the condition including restrictions andstigma. Theme 5: 'displays of coping' demonstrated that, for the most part,participants were keen to present themselves as living well with epilepsy.

USL261 was rapidly absorbed and pharmacodynamic effects returned to baseline within ~4h, regardless of age. Dose-dependent pharmacokinetic andmaximum pharmacodynamic effects were observed. Overall, pharmacokinetic findings for USL261 were similar to studies evaluating intravenous midazolam, whereaspharmacodynamic effects were less pronounced in the elderly than previouslyreported.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Trial of Cannabidiol for Drug-Resistant Seizures in the Dravet Syndrome.,/pubmed/28538134,"BACKGROUND: The Dravet syndrome is a complex childhood epilepsy disorder that is associated with drug-resistant seizures and a high mortality rate. We studiedcannabidiol for the treatment of drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome.METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 120children and young adults with the Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant seizures toreceive either cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or placebo, in addition to standard antiepileptic treatment. Theprimary end point was the change in convulsive-seizure frequency over a 14-weektreatment period, as compared with a 4-week baseline period.RESULTS: The median frequency of convulsive seizures per month decreased from12.4 to 5.9 with cannabidiol, as compared with a decrease from 14.9 to 14.1 with placebo (adjusted median difference between the cannabidiol group and the placebogroup in change in seizure frequency, -22.8 percentage points; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], -41.1 to -5.4; P=0.01). The percentage of patients who had atleast a 50% reduction in convulsive-seizure frequency was 43% with cannabidioland 27% with placebo (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.93 to 4.30; P=0.08). Thepatient's overall condition improved by at least one category on theseven-category Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale in 62% of thecannabidiol group as compared with 34% of the placebo group (P=0.02). Thefrequency of total seizures of all types was significantly reduced withcannabidiol (P=0.03), but there was no significant reduction in nonconvulsiveseizures. The percentage of patients who became seizure-free was 5% withcannabidiol and 0% with placebo (P=0.08). Adverse events that occurred morefrequently in the cannabidiol group than in the placebo group included diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and abnormal results on liver-functiontests. There were more withdrawals from the trial in the cannabidiol group.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with the Dravet syndrome, cannabidiol resulted in agreater reduction in convulsive-seizure frequency than placebo and was associatedwith higher rates of adverse events.

Effect of enzyme inhibition on perampanel pharmacokinetics: Why study design matters.,/pubmed/28535410,"OBJECTIVES: Perampanel, a selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial seizures with orwithout secondarily generalized seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonicseizures in patients with epilepsy aged 12years and older. In vitro studies andPhase I trials indicate that perampanel is metabolized almost exclusively byCYP3A, with an elimination half-life (t1/2) averaging approximately 105h.Understanding of pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions-enzyme inhibition orinduction-and anticipating their occurrence are important for management ofpatients with epilepsy. Here we report PK results from a Phase I drug-druginteraction (DDI) study (Study 005) combining perampanel with the CYP3A inhibitorketoconazole, as well as supplementary in silico predictions further exploringthis interaction.METHODS: A Phase I, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, two-waycrossover study was conducted in 26 healthy adult male volunteers. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. In one period, subjects received asingle 1-mg fasting dose of perampanel (Day1); in the other period, subjectsreceived ketoconazole 400mg once daily for 10days with a single 1-mg perampaneldose while fasting (Day3). Blood samples were drawn at multiple time points up to288h after the perampanel dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters of perampanel werecalculated by noncompartmental analysis, and safety was recorded. An integrated, physiologically based PK model built in SimcypÂ provided additional insight into this interaction. Drug-drug interaction intensity was measured by the ratio ofsystemic exposure (area under plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]) ofperampanel in the presence or absence of concomitant ketoconazole.RESULTS: Single oral doses of 1mg perampanel and once-daily oral doses ofketoconazole 400mg were safe and well tolerated. Maximum perampanel plasmaconcentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax showed no apparent differences whenperampanel was administered alone versus with ketoconazole. Ketoconazoleco-administration resulted in an approximate 20% increase in perampanel AUC(P<0.001). This increase, although statistically significant, was a<2.0-fold AUC change and alone would suggest a modest effect of ketoconazole. To furtherexplore these results, DDI simulations were performed to query the findings andtest additional study conditions. Using the actual trial conditions of Study 005,the simulations also predicted an AUC ratio increase <2-fold, providingverification of the simulation assumptions and the modest effect of ketoconazole for 10days. Simulations further suggested that an interaction effect ofketoconazole on perampanel exposure (>2-fold) of potential clinical significance could be predicted when using larger doses of ketoconazole (e.g., 200mg every 6h)coadministered for a greater time period (e.g., 30days), with AUC ratio as highas 3.36. Additionally, simulations suggested that a significant interaction with co-administration of perampanel and an inhibitor more potent than ketoconazole(such as itraconazole) could not be ruled out.CONCLUSIONS: Selecting an appropriate study design is critical to fullycharacterize the PK interaction for drugs such as perampanel that have a longt1/2. Although a negligible effect on perampanel PK was observed followingco-administration of ketoconazole 400mg/day for 10days, this is likely due inpart to the relatively brief co-administration period of ketoconazole andperampanel (<3 times the t1/2 of perampanel). While short-term administration of a CYP3A inhibitor may not significantly increase perampanel exposure, suchincreases may be expected following chronic and larger dosing or with a morepotent inhibitor.",RCT,,,,single 1-mg fasting dose of perampanel,ketoconazole 400mg once daily for 10days with a single 1-mg perampanel dose while fasting (Day3),,,healthy adult male volunteers,Pharmacokinetic parameters,
Treatment of refractory epilepsy patients with autologous mesenchymal stem cells reduces seizure frequency: An open label study.,/pubmed/28500900,"PURPOSE: Existing anti-epileptic drugs (AED) have limited efficiency in manypatients, necessitating the search for alternative approaches such as stem celltherapy. We report the use of autologous patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells(MSC) as a therapeutic agent in symptomatic drug-resistant epilepsy in a Phase I open label clinical trial (registered as NCT02497443).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients received either standard treatment with AED(control group), or AED supplemented with single intravenous administration ofundifferentiated autologous MSC (target dose of 1_106cells/kg), followed by asingle intrathecal injection of neurally induced autologous MSC (target dose of0.1_106cells/kg).RESULTS: MSC injections were well tolerated and did not cause any severe adverse effects. Seizure frequency was designated as the main outcome and evaluated at 1 year time point. 3 out of 10 patients in MSC therapy group achieved remission (noseizures for one year and more), and 5 additional patients became responders toAEDs, while only 2 out of 12 patients became responders in control group(difference significant, P=0.0135).CONCLUSIONS: MSC possess unique immunomodulatory properties and are a safe andpromising candidate for cell therapy in AED resistant epilepsy patients.",RCT,,,,standard treatment with AED (anti-epileptic drugs),AED (anti-epileptic drugs) supplemented with single intravenous administration of undifferentiated autologous MSC (mesenchymal stem cells),,,drug-resistant epilepsy,Seizure frequency,

In the core study, patients were randomized (1:2) to placebo or BGG492100¾mg t.i.d. in cohort 1, and in cohort 2 patients were randomized (1:4) toplacebo or BGG492 150¾mg t.i.d. On completion of the core study, eligiblepatients entered the extension study. Primary outcome measures were total partialseizure frequency per 28¾days (core study) and safety and tolerability (extensionstudy).RESULTS: Overall, 93 patients were randomized (150¾mg [n¾=¾44]; 100¾mg [n¾=¾24]; placebo [n¾=¾25]), and 81 (87.1%) completed the core study. Fifty-one patientsentered and 43 (84.3%) completed the extension study. In the core study, nostatistically significant dose-response trend among the BGG492 treatment groups(100 and 150¾mg) was observed at the 4-week double-blind maintenance period(weeks 7-10); however, there was higher percent reduction in total partialseizure frequency in the BGG492 150¾mg over placebo groups (37.32%; 95%confidence interval [CI] -18.90, 66.95). Dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue were the most common adverse events (AEs), higher in the BGG492 150¾mg group than inthe 100¾mg and placebo groups (dizziness: 14 [31.8%] vs. 3 [12.5%] and 1 [4.0%]; somnolence: 7 [15.9%] vs. 1 [4.2%] and 1 [4.0%]; fatigue: 5 [11.4%] vs. 1 [4.2%] and 1 [4.0%]). During the open-label extension study, 39 (76.5%) patients onBGG492 had AEs, and the most commonly experienced AEs were dizziness (14 [27.5%])and somnolence (9 [17.6%]).SIGNIFICANCE: There was no significant dose-response trend in the BGG492treatment groups (100 and 150¾mg); however, higher percent reduction over placebowas observed in the BGG492 150¾mg group.

Bedsores successfully treated with topical phenytoin.,/pubmed/28467333,"Phenytoin is normally used in epilepsy treatment. One of the side effectaffecting a significative part of the treated patients is the gingivalovergrowth. It could surely be a correlation between this stimulatory effect and the assessment of phenytoin in wound healing. In fact, some studies of theliterature have shown that topical phenytoin promotes healing of traumaticwounds, burns and ulcers by decubitus or stasis (diabetic or venous) and weemphasize, in vitiligo, a particular attention into repigmentation. The relatedmechanism of action seems to be multifactorial. In the present paper topicalphenytoin has been used as wound-healing agent in 19 documented cases ofbedsores, divided in treated and placebo group. The used concentration ofphenytoin was 5 mg/L dissolved in a water solution of 9 g NaCl /L (0.9% P/V ofNaCl). Patches soaked with phenytoin solution were applied over the bedsoresalong 3 hours every 12 hours. Results showed that phenytoin treated patientshealed their wounds significantly before (p<0.001) with respect to controls.",RCT,,,,topical phenytoin,placebo,,,bedsores,wound healing,
Influence of seizures on early development in tuberous sclerosis complex.,/pubmed/28457992,"OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is commonly seen in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Therelationship between seizures and developmental outcomes has been reported, butfew studies have examined this relationship in a prospective, longitudinalmanner. The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship betweenseizures and early development in TSC.METHODS: Analysis of 130 patients ages 0-36months with TSC participating in theTSC Autism Center of Excellence Network, a large multicenter, prospectiveobservational study evaluating biomarkers predictive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), was performed. Infants were evaluated longitudinally with standardizedevaluations, including cognitive, adaptive, and autism-specific measures. Seizurehistory was collected continuously throughout, including seizure type andfrequency.RESULTS: Data were analyzed at 6, 12, 18, and 24months of age. Patients without ahistory of seizures performed better on all developmental assessments at all timepoints compared to patients with a history of seizures and exhibited normaldevelopment at 24months. Patients with a history of seizures not only performedworse, but developmental progress lagged behind the group without seizures. Allpatients with a history of infantile spasms performed worse on all developmental assessments at 12, 18, and 24months. Higher seizure frequency correlated withpoorer outcomes on developmental testing at all time points, but particularly at 12months and beyond. Patients with higher seizure frequency during infancycontinued to perform worse developmentally through 24months. A logistic modellooking at the individual impact of infantile spasms, seizure frequency, and age of seizure onset as predictors of developmental delay revealed that age ofseizure onset was the most important factor in determining developmental outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study further define the relationship betweenseizures and developmental outcomes in young children with TSC. Early seizureonset in infants with TSC negatively impacts very early neurodevelopment, whichpersists through 24months of age.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Ketogenic diet in the treatment of epilepsy in children under the age of 2 years: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/28446244,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of epilepsy is greatest in the first 2 years of life,an age group where there is generally a poor prognosis for both seizure controland neurodevelopmental outcome. Early control of seizures can be associated with better developmental outcome but many of the epilepsies presenting in infancy arepoorly responsive to antiepileptic medication. The ketogenic diet (KD) is ahigh-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the effects of starvation onthe body. Dietary fat is converted into ketones in the body and used as an energysource by the brain. The KD has been shown to be successful in controllingseizures in many observational studies, and in two randomised controlled trials(RCTs) in older children. However, little evidence is available in the veryyoung.METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label RCT where eligible children (age 3 months to 2years with epilepsy who have failed two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) undergobaseline assessment, including medical and seizure history. Participants thenstart an observation period (7 or 14 days) with documentation of seizurefrequency. Randomisation will occur on day 8 or day 15 to receive the KD or afurther AED; the allocated treatment will commence on day 15, with instructionand training. A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will includea clinical review and tolerability questionnaire (modified Hague Scale of SideEffects - for those allocated to the KD group). Assessments will be repeated at 8weeks after the start of treatment including biochemical investigations, afterwhich, according to patient response, KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group)will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group who have failed toachieve seizure control at the 8-week assessment will then be offered KD outside the context of the trial. Those in the KD arm who fail to achieve seizure controlwill be changed to standard clinical management. All patients will be followed upfor 12 months from randomisation for retention, seizure outcome, quality of life and neurodevelopmental status.DISCUSSION: The slow rate of recruitment is an ongoing practical issue. There is a limitation to the number of eligible patients compared to what was predicted,mainly due to the nature of this patient group. After a substantial amendment to widen inclusion criteria and reduce the baseline period to 7 days for patientswith a high seizure burden, the rate of recruitment steadily increased. A number of operational concerns regarding dietetic time were also highlighted impactingon the recruitment rate. However, the combination of a low dropout rate and theopening of further centres, the trial should successfully meet the finalrecruitment target. All nine centres are now recruiting and we hope to openfurther centres within the UK.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02205931 . Registered on16 December 2013.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Heart-rate variability indices as predictors of the response to vagus nerve stimulation in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.,/pubmed/28440954,"OBJECTIVE: To assess heart-rate variability (HRV) measures of interictalelectrocardiography (ECG) for drug-resistant epilepsy and to relate the findings to the outcome of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) treatment.METHODS: Time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear analyses were used toanalyze preoperative HRV measures in 32 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy whohad received VNS implants at the same hospital and 32 healthy age- andsex-matched control subjects. HRV measurements based on ambulatory 24¾h ECGrecordings were analyzed to identify seizure reduction 1¾year after VNStreatment. Responders were defined as having at least 50% seizure reduction1¾year after treatment.RESULTS: Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had significantly lower timedomain (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50), frequency domain (VLF, LF, HF, TP), and nonlinear(SD1, SD2) HRV measurements than matched healthy controls. None of the analyzedHRV measures of the responders differed significantly from their controls,whereas those of the nonresponders had significantly lower RMSSD, pNN50, HF, and SD1 than the responders.SIGNIFICANCE: The preoperative HRV indices demonstrate that nonresponders havemore pronounced impairment of their cardiac autonomic function than theresponders. Presurgical HRV measurements representing parasympathetic cardiaccontrol or vagal tone were significantly associated with the responsiveness toVNS. Thus the measurements show promise for predicting the reduction of seizurefrequency after VNS treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging in progressive supranuclear palsy: A new combined score for clinical trials.,/pubmed/28436538,"BACKGROUND: Two recent, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II/III trials(clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01110720, NCT01049399) of davunetide and tideglusib inprogressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) generated prospective, 1-year longitudinaldatasets of high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional MRI.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative MRI disease progression measurement for clinical trials.METHODS: The authors performed a fully automated quantitative MRI analysisemploying atlas-based volumetry and provide sample size calculations based ondata collected in 99 PSP patients assigned to placebo in these trials. Based onindividual volumes of 44 brain compartments and structures at baseline and 52weeks of follow-up, means and standard deviations of annualized percentage volumechanges were used to estimate standardized effect sizes and the required samplesizes per group for future 2-armed, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials.RESULTS: The highest standardized effect sizes were found for midbrain, frontallobes, and the third ventricle. Using the annualized percentage volume change of these structures to detect a 50% change in the 1-year progression (80% power,significance level 5%) required lower numbers of patients per group (thirdventricle, n = 32; midbrain, n = 37; frontal lobe, n = 43) than the best clinicalscale (PSP rating scale total score, n = 58). A combination of volume changes in these 3 structures reduced the number of required patients to only 20 andcorrelated best with the progression in the clinical scales.CONCLUSIONS: We propose the 1-year change in the volumes of third ventricle,midbrain, and frontal lobe as combined imaging read-out for clinical trials inPSP that require the least number of patients for detecting efficacy to reducebrain atrophy.

T2 relaxometry helps prognosticate seizure outcome in patients with solitary cerebral cysticercosis.,/pubmed/28431589,"OBJECTIVE: Correlate serial T2 relaxometry (T2R) values with long term seizureoutcome in patients with solitary cerebral cysticercosis (SCC) in order toestablish its usefulness as a prognostic marker in these patients.METHODS: Patients with new-onset seizures due to SCC were imaged serially using apre-determined MRI protocol at enrolment and after 3, 6, 12 and 24months. T2relaxometry was performed using a dual echo sequence with maps generated manuallyfrom the measured image intensities at the level of the lesion. Patients wererandomised to receive albendazole plus antiepileptic drugs, or only antiepileptictreatment (""controls""). At each visit, as well as four years after studyinitiation, patients were reviewed for seizure recurrence. Clinical andradiological outcomes were assessed by physicians blinded to treatment received.RESULTS: Of 123 patients recruited, 77 had at least four MRIs and >12monthfollow-up, and were included for analysis. Baseline clinical and demographicparameters as well as antiepileptic treatment were similar between albendazoleand control groups. T2 values from the lesion were higher than normal parenchyma initially, and fell to approach normal over six months. Controls had higher T2values from the lesion centre and wall at six months than those who receivedalbendazole. However no difference was seen in T2 values from perilesionalparenchyma between treatment and control groups, indicating lack of modulation ofthe development of perilesional gliosis by albendazole therapy. Patients withseizures persisting >6months after enrolment had higher perilesional T2 valuesthan those who were seizure-free. A rise in perilesional T2 value at 12months is probably due to gliosis. A later stage of degeneration was associated with areduced likelihood of seizure relapse.SIGNIFICANCE: T2 relaxometry at three and six months after seizure onset canidentify patients likely to have seizures beyond six months after onset.Persistently abnormal T2 values in patients with poorer outcomes reflect thedevelopment of perilesional gliosis.",RCT,,,,albendazole plus antiepileptic drugs,"antiepileptictreatment",,,solitary cerebral cysticercosis,Seizure recurrence,

The safety assessments includedthe incidence of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, laboratorytests, percentile changes in weight, height, and body mass index, and Tannerstaging. Efficacy of treatment with edivoxetine was also assessed using theAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Version IV-Parent Reported:Investigator Scored (ADHDRS-IV) and Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity(CGI-ADHD-S).RESULTS: A total of 267 children and adolescents were enrolled and 20 completedthe 5-year study. Most of the participants were male (70.4%) and white (67.4%),and the mean age was 11.6 years. Two hundred three participants (76.9%; N_=_264) experienced at least one adverse event.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of unilateral andbilateral constant-current DBS of the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus in patients with essential tremor whose tremor was inadequatelycontrolled by medications. The primary outcome measure was a rater-blindedassessment of the change in the target limb tremor score in the stimulation-onversus stimulation-off state six months following surgery. Multiple secondaryoutcomes were assessed at one-year follow-up, including motor, mood, andquality-of-life measures.RESULTS: 127 patients were implanted with VIM DBS.

The average follow-up was 6.1 implant years. The median percent seizure reduction was 70% in patients with frontal and parietal seizure onsets, 58% in those with temporalneocortical onsets, and 51% in those with multilobar onsets (last observationcarried forward [LOCF] analysis). Twenty-six percent of patients experienced atleast one seizure-free period of 6¾months or longer and 14% experienced at least one seizure-free period of 1¾year or longer. Patients with lesions on magneticresonance imaging (MRI; 77% reduction, LOCF) and those with normal MRI findings(45% reduction, LOCF) benefitted, although the treatment response was more robustin patients with an MRI lesion (p¾=¾0.02, generalized estimating equation [GEE]).There were no differences in the seizure reduction in patients with and withoutprior epilepsy surgery or vagus nerve stimulation. Stimulation parameters usedfor treatment did not cause acute or chronic neurologic deficits, even ineloquent cortical areas. The rates of infection (0.017 per patient implant year) and perioperative hemorrhage (0.8%) were not greater than with otherneurostimulation devices.SIGNIFICANCE: Brain-responsive stimulation represents a safe and effectivetreatment option for patients with medically intractable epilepsy, includingadults with seizures of neocortical onset, and those with onsets from eloquentcortex.",Single arm,Y,,,brain-responsive stimulation,,,,partial seizures of neocortical origin,seizure reduction over years 2-6 postimplantation,
Effects of Cornus mas L. and Morus rubra L. extracts on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity: an electrophysiological and biochemical study.,/pubmed/28379215,"Traditionally, Morus rubra L. (Moraceae) (red mulberry) and Cornus mas L.(Cornacea) (cornelian cherry) fruits are eaten fresh and are also used inmarmalades, juices, jam, natural dyes in Turkey and are believed to havebeneficial effects in case of multiple health issues such as antipyretic,diarrhea and intestinal parasites. However, the effects of M. rubra and C. mas onepilepsy has not been known. This study evaluates the effects of M. rubra and C. mas extracts on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. Sixty Wistar ratsrandomly divided into ten groups (n=6): control, sham, penicillin, penicillin+M. rubra extract (2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg) and penicillin+C. mas extract (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg). Epileptiform activity was induced by using penicillin (500 IU, i.c.) and electrocorticogram records (150 min) were obtained. Also, biochemical analysis inblood samples were evaluated. According to the electrocorticogram analysis, theeffective dose was detected as 10 mg/kg for both C. mas and M. rubra. This dosedecreased the spike frequencies of convulsions while amplitude wasn't changed by both substances. In erythrocyte studies, there were significant differencesregarding nitric oxide in the control, sham and penicillin groups. There weresignificant differences regarding malondialdehyde in all groups. In the plasma,there were significant differences among groups regarding xanthine oxidase in thepenicillin_C. mas and penicillin_M. rubra groups. There were differencesregarding malondialdehyde in the penicillin-C. mas and M. rubra-C. mas groups.Both extracts reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity. Afteradministration of the extracts malondialdehyde levels decreased also in botherythrocytes and plasma.",N,,,,penicillin+M. rubra extract,penicillin+C. mas extract,penicillin,sham,penicillin-induced epileptiform activity,spike frequencies of convulsions,
Evaluate the effects of long-term valproic acid treatment on metabolic profiles in newly diagnosed or untreated female epileptic patients: A prospective study.,/pubmed/28365440,"PURPOSE: Excessive weight gain associated with sodium valproate (VPA) maypredispose patients with epilepsy to other health problems such as insulinresistance. We prospectively evaluated the long-term impact of VPA monotherapycompared with lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy on anthropometric and metabolicparameters in women with epilepsy. Our primary objective is to understand theunderlying mechanism responsible for VPA-induced obesity.METHODS: Sixty-six female patients with newly diagnosed or untreated epilepsywere included in the study. Thirty-four patients with VPA and thirty-two patientswith LTG were treated for a period of one year in our center. Anthropometric and clinical data were collected at 5 time points: before, at 6th week, 3rd month,6th month, 9th month and 12th month (last visit). Biochemical and hormonal datawere collected 2 time points: before and last visit.RESULTS: Subjects in the VPA group had significantly higher body weight thanLTG-treated subjects (64.88±3.25 vs. 58.28±2.43, P<0.001). HOMA-IR level wassignificantly increased (2.76 vs. 1.35, P<0.05), and adiponectin levels weresignificantly lower in the VPA group (3.46 vs. 6.22, P<0.05). Triglycerideslevels were significantly increased (118 vs. 96, P<0.05), and HDL-C levels weresignificantly lower in the VPA group. Both the VPA-treated group and theLTG-treated group showed no significant difference in term of total cholesterol, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose and serum leptin levels.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, we proposed that VPA inducedhypoadiponectinemia which correlates significantly with insulin resistance. Thesetwo factors may be responsible for weight gain, possible by stimulating appetite.Valproic acid appears to be use cautionally in obese females with epilepsy.",RCT,,,,sodium valproate,lamotrigine,,,women with epilepsy,Anthropometric and clinical data,
Amygdala Lesions Reduce Anxiety-like Behavior in a Human Benzodiazepine-Sensitive Approach-Avoidance Conflict Test.,/pubmed/28364943,"BACKGROUND: Rodent approach-avoidance conflict tests are common preclinicalmodels of human anxiety disorder. Their translational validity mainly rests onthe observation that anxiolytic drugs reduce rodent anxiety-like behavior. Here, we capitalized on a recently developed approach-avoidance conflict computer game to investigate the impact of benzodiazepines and of amygdala lesions on putative human anxiety-like behavior. In successive epochs of this game, participantscollect monetary tokens on a spatial grid while under threat of virtualpredation.METHODS: In a preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the effect of a single dose (1 mg) of lorazepam (n = 59). We thencompared 2 patients with bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndromewith age- and gender-matched control participants (n = 17). Based on a previousreport, the primary outcome measure was the effect of intra-epoch time (i.e., an adaptation to increasing potential loss) on presence in the safe quadrant of the spatial grid. We hypothesized reduced loss adaptation in this measure underlorazepam and in patients with amygdala lesions.RESULTS: Lorazepam and amygdala lesions reduced loss adaptation in the primaryoutcome measure. We found similar results in several secondary outcome measures. The relative reduction of anxiety-like behavior in patients with amygdala lesionswas qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from an impact of anteriorhippocampus lesions found in a previous report.CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish the translational validity of humanapproach-avoidance conflict tests in terms of anxiolytic drug action. Weidentified the amygdala, in addition to the hippocampus, as a critical structure in human anxiety-like behavior.",RCT,,,,lorazepam,,,,bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndrome,"effect of intra-epoch time (i.e., an adaptation to increasing potential loss) on presence in the safe quadrant of the spatial grid",
Brand-to-generic levetiracetam switch in patients with epilepsy in a routine clinical setting.,/pubmed/28363098,"PURPOSE: The therapeutic equivalence of generic and brand antiepileptic drugs,based on studies performed on healthy volunteers, has been questioned. Wecompare, in a routine clinical setting, brand versus generic levetiracetam (LEV) bioequivalence in patients with epilepsy and also the clinical efficacy andtolerability of the substitution.METHODS: A prospective, open-label, non-randomized, steady-state, multiple-dose, bioequivalence study was conducted in 12 patients with epilepsy (5 females), witha mean age of 38.4±16.2 years. Patients treated with the brand LEV (Keppra; UCBPharma) were closely followed for a four-week period and subsequently switched toa generic LEV (Pharmaten) and followed for another four-week period. Bloodsamples were collected at the end of each 4-week period, during a dose intervalfor each formulation, for LEV concentration measurements by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. Steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasmaconcentration (Cmax) data were subjected to conventional average bioequivalenceanalysis. Secondary clinical outcomes, including seizure frequency and adverseevents, were recorded.RESULTS: Patients had epilepsy for a mean period of 14.1±10.6years and the meandaily LEV dose was 2583.3±763.7mg. The mean AUC±SD and Cmax±SD was288.4±86.3(mg/L)h and 37.8±10.4mg/L respectively for brand LEV and319.2±104.7(mg/L)h and 41.6±12.3mg/L respectively for the generic LEV. Statistic analysis showed no statistical significant difference in bioequivalence. Also, nochange in seizures frequency and/or adverse events was recorded.CONCLUSIONS: In our clinical setting, generic LEV was determined to bebioequivalent to brand LEV. Furthermore, seizures frequency or/and adverse eventswere not affected upon switching from brand to generic LEV.",N,,,,brand levetiracetam,generic levetiracetam,,,epilepsy,therapeutic equivalence,
Better than sham? A double-blind placebo-controlled neurofeedback study in primary insomnia.,/pubmed/28335000,"See Thibault et al. (doi:10.1093/awx033) for a scientific commentary on thisarticle.Neurofeedback training builds upon the simple concept of instrumentalconditioning, i.e. behaviour that is rewarded is more likely to reoccur, aneffect Thorndike referred to as the 'law of effect'. In the case ofneurofeedback, information about specific electroencephalographic activity is fedback to the participant who is rewarded whenever the desiredelectroencephalography pattern is generated. If some kind of hyperarousal needsto be addressed, the neurofeedback community considers sensorimotor rhythmneurofeedback as the gold standard. Earlier treatment approaches usingsensorimotor-rhythm neurofeedback indicated that training to increase 12-15 Hzsensorimotor rhythm over the sensorimotor cortex during wakefulness could reduce attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy symptoms and even improvesleep quality by enhancing sleep spindle activity (lying in the same frequencyrange). In the present study we sought to critically test whether earlierfindings on the positive effect of sensorimotor rhythm neurofeedback on sleepquality and memory could also be replicated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study on 25 patients with insomnia. Patients spent nine polysomnography nightsand 12 sessions of neurofeedback and 12 sessions of placebo-feedback training(sham) in our laboratory. Crucially, we found both neurofeedback and placebofeedback to be equally effective as reflected in subjective measures of sleepcomplaints suggesting that the observed improvements were due to unspecificfactors such as experiencing trust and receiving care and empathy fromexperimenters. In addition, these improvements were not reflected in objectiveelectroencephalographic-derived measures of sleep quality. Furthermore, objectiveelectroencephalographic measures that potentially reflected mechanisms underlyingthe efficacy of neurofeedback such as spectral electroencephalographic measuresand sleep spindle parameters remained unchanged following 12 training sessions. Astratification into 'true' insomnia patients and 'insomnia misperceivers'(subjective, but no objective sleep problems) did not alter the results. Based onthis comprehensive and well-controlled study, we conclude that for the treatment of primary insomnia, neurofeedback does not have a specific efficacy beyondunspecific placebo effects. Importantly, we do not find an advantage ofneurofeedback over placebo feedback, therefore it cannot be recommended as analternative to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, the current(non-pharmacological) standard-of-care treatment. In addition, our study mayfoster a critical discussion that generally questions the effectiveness ofneurofeedback, and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating neurofeedbackefficacy in other study samples and disorders using truly placebo anddouble-blind controlled trials.",RCT,,,,neurofeedback,placebo-feedback training,,,Patients with insomnia,Subjective measures of sleep complaints,
HD-tDCS in refractory lateral frontal lobe epilepsy patients.,/pubmed/28324765,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the anticonvulsant effect of the novel high definitiontranscranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) method on patients withrefractory lateral frontal lobe epilepsy. The effects of HD-tDCS on workingmemory were also examined.METHOD: 10 adult patients with intractable lateral frontal lobe epilepsy werestudied. A central cathode electrode was placed on the epileptogenic zoneaccording to LTM, and 20-min sessions of 2mA HD-tDCS were applied for 10consecutive days. The primary endpoint was to make changes in the epileptiformdischarges (EDs) during a 1-h EEG. Moreover, the seizure frequency based onseizure diary and neuropsychiatric parameters was evaluated.RESULTS: All patients tolerated HD-tDCS stimulation course without any adversereaction. The frequency of EDs increased immediately and one month after thestimulation course by an average of 6.4% and 1.2%, respectively. However, thesechanges in the EDs frequency were not statistically significant (p-value >0.05). The mean seizure frequency changes showed decrement by an average of 17.9%immediately, and increment by an average of 38.1% one month after the HD-tDCS.These changes were not significant statistically (p-value >0.05). One patientexperienced exacerbation of seizures during the stimulations hence dropped out ofthe study. Attention and working memory improved significantly immediately andone month after the HD-tDCS in all patients.CONCLUSION: Changes of EDs and mean seizure frequency caused by HD-tDCS were not statistically significant for the whole group; however, this method could improvethe patients' working memory scores.",Single arm,Y,,,high definition transcranial direct current stimulation,,,,intractable lateral frontal lobe epilepsy,changes in the epileptiform discharges (EDs) during a 1-h EEG,

Time-to-Seizure Modeling of Lacosamide Used in Monotherapy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy.,/pubmed/28290119,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the relationship between exposure to lacosamidemonotherapy and seizure probability, and to simulate the effect of changing thedose regimen.METHODS: Structural time-to-event models for dropouts (not because of a lack ofefficacy) and seizures were developed using data from 883 adult patients newlydiagnosed with epilepsy and experiencing focal or generalized tonic-clonicseizures, participating in a trial (SP0993; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT01243177) comparing the efficacy of lacosamide and carbamazepinecontrolled-release monotherapy. Lacosamide dropout and seizure models were usedfor simulating the effect of changing the initial target dose on seizure freedom.RESULTS: Repeated time-to-seizure data were described by a Weibull distributionwith parameters estimated separately for the first and subsequent seizures. Dailyarea under the plasma concentration-time curve was related linearly to thelog-hazard. Disease severity, expressed as the number of seizures during the3¾months before the trial (baseline), was a strong predictor of seizureprobability: patients with 7-50 seizures at baseline had a 2.6-fold (90%confidence interval 2.01-3.31) higher risk of seizures compared with thereference two to six seizures. Simulations suggested that a 400-mg/day, ratherthan a 200-mg/day initial target dose for patients with seven or more seizures atbaseline could potentially result in an additional 8% of seizure-free patientsfor 6¾months at the last evaluated dose level. Patients receiving lacosamide had a slightly lower dropout risk compared with those receiving carbamazepine.CONCLUSION: Baseline disease severity was the most important predictor of seizureprobability. Simulations suggest that an initial target dose >200¾mg/day couldpotentially benefit patients with greater disease severity.",Single arm,Y,,,Lacosamide,carbamazepine,,,epilepsy,Time to seizure,

Brivaracetam population pharmacokinetics in children with epilepsy aged 1_month to 16_years.,/pubmed/28280887,"PURPOSE: The aims of the study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic modelof orally administered brivaracetam in paediatric patients and to provide dosing suggestions.METHODS: Analysis included 600 brivaracetam plasma concentrations from a phase 2astudy (NCT00422422; N01263) in 96 paediatric patients with epilepsy aged 1¾month to 16¾years, taking one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling, and a stepwise covariate search was used to determine factors influencingbrivaracetam clearance. Simulations were performed to investigate dosingregimens.RESULTS: The final model consisted of first-order absorption, single compartment distribution and first-order elimination components with allometric scaling ofclearance and volume using lean body weight and fixed allometric exponents.Co-administration with phenobarbital or carbamazepine was associated with a 29%(95%CI 17%/39%) and 32% (22%/42%) decrease in exposure, respectively.Co-administration with valproate was associated with an 11% (1%/23%) increase in exposure. Simulations demonstrated that the majority of children were predictedto have an exposure similar to that in adults, using an age-independent dosingregimen of 2.0¾mg/kg bid with a maximum of 100¾mg bid for body weight >50¾kg.CONCLUSIONS: A paediatric dose adaptation of 2.0¾mg/kg twice daily with a maximumof 100¾mg twice daily for body weight >50¾kg is predicted to ensure steady-state plasma concentrations in the same range as in adult patients receiving 100¾mgtwice daily (highest recommended dose).

"Social correlates of health status, quality of life, and mood states in patients treated with cannabidiol for epilepsy.",/pubmed/28236578,"Social characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, play arole in the treatment and outcomes of patients with epilepsy (PWE), but little isknown about how these factors affect patients receiving cannabidiol (CBD) totreat seizures. This exploratory study examined the sociodemographic profile ofpatients treated with CBD (n=80) and associations between social factors andpatient-centered outcomes - overall health status, Quality of Life in Epilepsy-89(QOLIE-89), and Profile of Mood States (POMS) - in this population. Associations were examined using Pearson correlations and multiple ordinary-least-squaresregression (alpha=0.1). The sample was predominantly white (96%) andnon-Hispanic/Latino (96%); 76% of patients had family incomes of $40,000+/year.Some patients/families reported experiencing food scarcity (13%), not being able to make ends meet (6%), or not being able to afford antiepileptic medications(8%). The patients' health ratings declined with age and income (p_0.014), andthere was a statistically significant interaction (p<0.055) between thesevariables: for example, a higher-income 10-year-old had a predicted health ratingof 3 (""very good""), followed by a higher-income 40-year-old with a rating of 2(""good""), a low-income 10-year-old with a rating of 1 (""fair""), and a low-income 40-year-old with a rating of 0 (""poor""). This is the first study reporting thesocial profile of patients taking pharmaceutical grade CBD for the treatment ofepilepsy. The results suggest that despite free access to this treatment somepatients may not be accessing CBD because of their socioeconomic situation orrace/ethnicity.

After an8-week baseline period, patients were randomized 2:1 to ganaxolone 1,500¾mg/dayor placebo for a 10-week treatment period (2-week forced titration and 8-weekmaintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extensionstudy. The primary endpoint was mean weekly seizure frequency. Secondaryendpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing _50% reduction inseizure frequency (responder rate), percent change in mean weekly seizurefrequency, seizure-free days, and quality of life. Safety and tolerabilityassessments included adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, andclinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on theintent-to-treat population.RESULTS: Of 147 randomized patients (98 ganaxolone, 49 placebo), 131 completedthe study; 95% of participants titrated up to 1,500¾mg/day and 78% maintainedthis dose. From baseline to endpoint, mean weekly seizure frequency decreasedwith ganaxolone (6.5-5.2) versus placebo (9.2-10.8), representing an 11.4%decrease versus placebo (p¾=¾0.0489, analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]).

We investigated the diagnosticyield and management implications of whole exome sequencing (WES)-based screeningof selected genes in the routine care of common focal epilepsies suspected tohave a genetic basis.METHODS: We performed WES, followed by targeted analysis of 64 epilepsy genes, on40 consecutive children and adults enrolled prospectively from routine clinicalpractice who had MRI-negative focal epilepsy and a family history of febrileseizures or any type of epilepsy in at least one first- or second-degreerelative. Exclusion criteria were previous genetic testing, severe intellectualdisability and benign focal epilepsies of childhood.RESULTS: 5/40 (12.5%) patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant,detected in SCN1A, DEPDC5, PCDH19, GABRG2 or NPRL2. Identifying a pathogenicSCN1A variant in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy prompted to haltpresurgical investigations due to concern of unfavorable post-surgical outcome.It also led in the same patient to discontinue long-standing carbamazepinetherapy (a potentially aggravating drug in epilepsies due to SCN1A mutations),resulting in complete seizure control. Patients with pathogenic or likelypathogenic variants had a younger median age of seizure onset (range) compared tothose without [18 months (8 months-18 years) vs 18 years (18 months-70 years),p=0.02].SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that WES with targeted gene analysis is aneffective diagnostic tool for patients with common focal epilepsies in whom agenetic etiology is suspected. It can also influence clinical decision-making,including antiepileptic drug selection and consideration of epilepsy surgery,hence supporting its incorporation in the routine clinical care of this patientgroup.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Phenobarbital or potassium bromide as an add-on antiepileptic drug for the management of canine idiopathic epilepsy refractory to imepitoin.,/pubmed/28190495,"Imepitoin has recently been approved in Europe for the management of dogs withidiopathic epilepsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based information available on the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs used as additions to the therapeuticregimen in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy that are not well controlled withimepitoin. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of phenobarbitalor potassium bromide (KBr) as add-on antiepileptic drugs for controlling dogsrefractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin (30_mg/kg twice daily). The study wasperformed as a prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial. The efficacyof phenobarbital and KBr was evaluated by comparing monthly seizure frequency(MSF), monthly seizure day frequency (MSDF), the presence of cluster seizuresduring a retrospective 2-month period with a prospective follow-up of 6 months,and the overall responder rate. Twenty-seven dogs were included in the study, 14 dogs in the phenobarbital group and 13 dogs in the KBr group. Both median MSF andMSDF decreased in the phenobarbital group (both P_=_0.001) and in the KBr group(P_=_0.004 and P_=_0.003, respectively). Overall, the number of dogs with clusterseizures decreased (P_=_0.0005). The responder rate was 79% vs. 69% in thephenobarbital and KBr groups, respectively. We conclude that phenobarbital or KBradd-on treatment decreases median MSF and MSDF in epileptic dogs refractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated andresulted in an improvement in seizure management in the majority of the dogs.",RCT,,,,phenobarbital,potassium bromide,,,idiopathic epilepsy,monthly seizure frequency,
Wordless intervention for people with epilepsy and learning disabilities (WIELD): a randomised controlled feasibility trial.,/pubmed/28186943,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlledtrial of a picture booklet to improve quality of life for people with epilepsyand learning disabilities.TRIAL DESIGN: A randomised controlled feasibility trial. Randomisation was notblinded and was conducted using a centralised secure database and a blocked 1:1allocation ratio.SETTING: Epilepsy clinics in 1 English National Health Service (NHS) Trust.PARTICIPANTS: Patients with learning disabilities and epilepsy who had: a seizurewithin the past 12_months, meaningful communication and a carer with sufficientproficiency in English.INTERVENTION: Participants in the intervention group used a picture booklet with a trained researcher, and a carer present. These participants kept the booklet,and were asked to use it at least twice more over 20_weeks. The control groupreceived treatment as usual, and were provided with a booklet at the end of thestudy.OUTCOME MEASURES: 7 feasibility criteria were used relating to recruitment, data collection, attrition, potential effect on epilepsy-related quality of life(Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life Scale, ELDQOL) at 4-week,12-week and 20-week follow-ups, feasibility of methodology, acceptability of the intervention and potential to calculate cost-effectiveness.OUTCOME: The recruitment rate of eligible patients was 34% and the target of 40participants was reached. There was minimal missing data and attrition. Anintention-to-treat analysis was performed; data from the outcome measures suggesta benefit from the intervention on the ELDQOL behaviour and mood subscales at 4and 20_weeks follow-up. The booklet and study methods were positively received,and no adverse events were reported. There was a positive indication of thepotential for a cost-effectiveness analysis.CONCLUSIONS: All feasibility criteria were fully or partially met, thereforeconfirming feasibility of a definitive trial.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN80067039.",N,,,,,,,,,,
People with epilepsy obtain added value from education in groups: results of a qualitative study.,/pubmed/28181344,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Having epilepsy requires individuals to learn aboutself-management. So far, trials of self-management courses have not includedin-depth qualitative evaluations of how the learning method influencesparticipants' perceptions and behaviour. We aimed to interview participants whohad attended a course, as part of a randomized controlled trial, to examine: (i) their perceptions of what they valued and negative aspects of the intervention,and (ii) whether and in what ways they continued to make use of the training.METHODS: Twenty participants were selected within 6 months of undertaking acourse from the larger randomized controlled trial conducted in England.Semi-structured interviews were based on a topic guide.RESULTS: Participants' characteristics were representative of the clinical anddemographic characteristics of the trial group. Their mean age was 44 years, halfwere male, and three-quarters had had epilepsy for over 10 years and hadexperienced one or more seizures in the previous month. Participants valued theopportunity to meet 'people like them'. Structured learning methods encouragedthem to share and compare feelings and experience. Specific benefits included:overcoming the sense of 'being alone' and improving self-acceptance throughmeeting people with similar experience. Over half reported that this, andcomparison of attitudes and experience, helped them to improve their confidenceto talk openly, and make changes in health behaviours.CONCLUSIONS: People feel socially isolated in long-term poorly controlledepilepsy. They gain confidence and self-acceptance from interactive groups.Expert-facilitated courses that encourage experiential learning can help peoplelearn from each other, and this may enhance self-efficacy and behaviour change.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Protocol for the ENCODE trial: evaluating a novel online depression intervention for persons with epilepsy.,/pubmed/28173780,"BACKGROUND: Depression is common among persons with epilepsy (PwE), affectingroughly one in three individuals, and its presence is associated with personalsuffering, impaired quality of life, and worse prognosis. Despite theavailability of effective treatments, depression is often overlooked and treated inadequately in PwE, in part because of assumed concerns over drug interactionsor proconvulsant effects of antidepressants. Internet-administered psychological interventions might complement antidepressant medication or psychotherapy, andpreliminary evidence suggests that they can be effective. However, no trial hasyet examined whether an Internet intervention designed to meet the needs of PwEcan achieve sustained reductions in depression and related symptoms, such asanxiety, when offered as adjunct to treatment as usual.METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial will include 200 participantswith epilepsy and a current depressive disorder, along with currently at leastmoderately elevated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) sum score ofat least 10). Patients will be recruited via epilepsy treatment centers and othersources, including Internet forums, newspaper articles, flyers, posters, andmedia articles or advertisements, in German-speaking countries. Main inclusioncriteria are: self-reported diagnosis of epilepsy and a depressive disorder, asassessed with a phone-administered structured diagnostic interview, none orstable antidepressant medication, no current psychotherapy, no other majorpsychiatric disorder, no acute suicidality. Participants will be randomlyassigned to either (1) a care-as-usual/waitlist (CAU/WL) control group, in which they receive CAU and are given access to the Internet intervention after 3¾months(that is, a CAU/WL control group), or (2) a treatment group that may also use CAUand in addition immediately receives six-month access to the novel,Internet-administered intervention. The primary outcome measure is the PHQ-9,collected at three months post-baseline; secondary measures include self-reportedanxiety, work and social adjustment, epilepsy symptoms (including seizurefrequency and severity), medication adherence, potential negative treatmenteffects and health-related quality of life. Measurements are collected online at pre-treatment (T0), three months (T1), six months (T2), and nine months (T3).DISCUSSION: Results of this trial are expected to extend the body of knowledgewith regard to effective and efficient treatment options for PwE who experienceelevated depression and anxiety.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02791724 .

Pharmacogenetics of antiepileptic drug efficacy in childhood absence epilepsy.,/pubmed/28165634,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether common polymorphisms in CACNA1G, CACNA1H,CACNA1I, and ABCB1 are associated with differential short-term seizure outcome inchildhood absence epilepsy (CAE).METHODS: Four hundred forty-six CAE children in a randomized double-blind trialof ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproate had short-term seizure outcomedetermined. Associations between polymorphisms (minor allele frequency___15%) in 4 genes and seizure outcomes were assessed. In vitro electrophysiology ontransfected CACNA1H channels determined impact of 1 variant on T-type calciumchannel responsiveness to ethosuximide.RESULTS: Eighty percent (357 of 446) of subjects had informative short-termseizure status (242 seizure free, 115 not seizure free). In ethosuximidesubjects, 2 polymorphisms (CACNA1H rs61734410/P640L, CACNA1I rs3747178) appeared more commonly among not-seizure-free participants (p_=_0.011, odds ratio[OR]_=_2.63, 95% confidence limits [CL]_=_1.25-5.56; p_=_0.026, OR_=_2.38, 95%CL_=_1.11-5.00). In lamotrigine subjects, 1 ABCB1 missense polymorphism(rs2032582/S893A; p_=_0.015, OR_=_2.22, 95% CL_=_1.16-4.17) was more common innot-seizure-free participants, and 2 CACNA1H polymorphisms (rs2753326, rs2753325)were more common in seizure-free participants (p_=_0.038, OR_=_0.52, 95%CL_=_0.28-0.96). In valproate subjects, no common polymorphisms were associatedwith seizure status. In vitro electrophysiological studies showed no effect ofthe P640L polymorphism on channel physiology in the absence of ethosuximide.Ethosuximide's effect on rate of decay of CaV 3.2 was significantly less forP640L channel compared to wild-type channel.INTERPRETATION: Four T-type calcium channel variants and 1 ABCB1 transportervariant were associated with differential drug response in CAE. The in vivo P640Lvariant's ethosuximide effect was confirmed by in vitro electrophysiologicalstudies. This suggests that genetic variation plays a role in differential CAEdrug response.

Subjective seizure counts by epilepsy clinical drug trial participants are not reliable.,/pubmed/28139449,"PURPOSE: Self-reported seizure counts of patients with epilepsy guide individual treatment decisions and often represent the primary outcome measure ofpharmacological trial in epileptology. The validity of these data has recentlybeen challenged and the question is whether this applies to participants ofclinical studies as well. Here we compared self-estimated seizure counting anddocumentation accuracy in participants and nonparticipants of former epilepsyclinical drug trials.METHODS: Adult participants (N=100) from a total of twenty-two phase II, III orIV clinical drug studies performed at our unit (2002-2015) underwent a structuredtelephone interview on self-estimated seizure awareness and seizure documentationaccuracy. Data were compared to data from a recent study in adult epilepsypatients (N=132) who never participated in clinical trials and who answered thesame questions (Blachut et al., Seizure 2015; 29:97-103).RESULTS: Reported seizure frequencies, self-estimated seizure documentationaccuracy (at best 46-53%), and the motivation for seizure-documentation werealmost identical in both groups and no group effect was found except for higherself-reported awareness for nocturnal seizures in former study participants.CONCLUSION: Epilepsy patients having participated in clinical drug trials report comparable erroneous seizure counts as do epilepsy patients in general. Thesedata further corroborate the notion that most clinical trials in epileptology arebased on inaccurate measures.

Effect of patient-initiated versus fixed-interval telePRO-based outpatient follow-up: study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled study.,/pubmed/28122609,"BACKGROUND: The traditional system of routine outpatient follow-up of chronicdisease in secondary care may involve a waste of resources if patients are well. The use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) could support more flexible,cost-saving follow-up activities. AmbuFlex is a PRO system used in outpatientfollow-up in the Central Denmark Region. PRO questionnaires are sent to patients at fixed intervals. The clinicians use the PRO data to decide whether a patientneeds a visit or not (standard telePRO). PRO may make patients become moreinvolved in their own care pathway, which may improve their self-management.Better self-management may also be achieved by letting patients initiate contact.The aim of this study is to obtain data on the effects of patient-initiatedfollow-up (open access telePRO) on resource utilisation, quality of care, and thepatient perspective.METHODS: The study is a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial in outpatientswith epilepsy. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two follow-upactivities: a) standard telePRO or b) open access telePRO. Inclusion criteria areage___15¾years and previous referral to standard telePRO follow-up at AarhusUniversity Hospital, Denmark. Furthermore, patients must have answered the lastquestionnaire via the Internet. The number of contacts will be used as theprimary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include well-being (WHO-5Well-Being Index), general health, number of seizures, treatment side effects,mortality, health literacy (Health Literacy Questionnaire), self-efficacy(General Self-Efficacy scale), patient activation, confidence, safety, andsatisfaction. In addition, the patient perspective will be explored byqualitative methods. Data will be collected at baseline and 18¾month afterrandomisation. Inclusion of patients in the study started in January 2016.Statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. For qualitative data, the interpretive description strategy will be used.DISCUSSION: The benefits and possible drawbacks of the PRO-based open accessapproach will be evaluated. The present study will provide important knowledge toguide future telePRO interventions in relation to effect on resource utilisation,quality of care, and the patient perspective.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02673580 (Registration date January28, 2016).",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical features of benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes in chinese children.,/pubmed/28121917,"This multicenter clinical trial was conducted to examine current practice ofbenign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and especially address the questionthat in what circumstances 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) should bepreferred.Twenty-five medical centers participate in this clinical trial.

Clinical evaluation of a combination therapy of imepitoin with phenobarbital in dogs with refractory idiopathic epilepsy.,/pubmed/28118828,"BACKGROUND: Imepitoin was tested as a combination treatment with phenobarbital inan open-label mono-centre cohort study in dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy.Diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy was based on clinical findings, magneticresonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Three cohorts were treated.In cohort A, dogs not responding to phenobarbital with or without establishedadd-on treatment of potassium bromide or levetiracetam were treated add-on withimepitoin, starting at 10¾mg/kg BID, with titration allowed to 30¾mg/kg BID. Incohort B, the only difference to cohort A was that the starting dose of imepitoinwas reduced to 5¾mg/kg BID. In cohort C, animals not responding to imepitoin at>20¾mg/kg BID were treated with phenobarbital add-on starting at 0.5¾mg/kg BID.RESULTS: The add-on treatment resulted in a reduction in monthly seizurefrequency (MSF) in all three cohorts. A reduction of _50% was obtained in 36-42% of all animals, without significant difference between cohorts. The lowerstarting dose of 5¾mg/kg BID imepitoin was better tolerated, and an up-titration to on average of 15¾mg/kg BID was sufficient in cohort A and B. In cohort C, amean add-on dose of 1.5¾mg/kg BID phenobarbital was sufficient to achieve aclinically meaningful effect. Six dogs developed a clinically meaningful increasein MSF of___50%, mostly in cohort A. Neither imepitoin nor phenobarbital add-ontreatment was capable of suppressing cluster seizure activity, making clusterseizure activity an important predictor for drug-resistance.CONCLUSION: A combination treatment of imepitoin and phenobarbital is a usefultreatment option for a subpopulation of dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy, a low starting dose with 5¾mg/kg BID is recommended.",Single arm,Y,,,imepitoin,,,,idiopathic epilepsy,monthly seizure frequency,

Standardizedassessments of near-transfer effects (i.e., visual and auditory attention and WM)were completed prior to and immediately after intervention and at 3-monthfollow-up. An additional measure assessing the far-transfer effect of fluidreasoning was administered prior to intervention and at 3-month follow-up.RESULTS: Participants exhibited gains in auditory and visual attention and WMimmediately following intervention and gains were generally sustained at 3-month follow-up. Intervention did not improve visual-verbal WM or fluid reasoning. The clinical variables studied (i.e., age of seizure onset, seizure frequency,epilepsy duration, and overall intellectual functioning) did not elucidatereliable relationships with intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Working memory training is possibly efficacious in improving relatedskills which are maintained for 3months in children with active epilepsy.

Oral cannabidiol does not produce a signal for abuse liability in frequent marijuana smokers.,/pubmed/28088032,"BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a naturally occurring constituent of themarijuana plant. In the past few years, there has been great interest in thetherapeutic effects of isolated CBD and it is currently being explored fornumerous disease conditions (e.g., pain, epilepsy, cancer, various drugdependencies). However, CBD remains a Schedule I drug on the U.S. ControlledSubstances Act (CSA). Despite its status, there are no well-controlled dataavailable regarding its abuse liability.METHODS: Healthy, frequent marijuana users (n=31) were enrolled in this withinsubject, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multisite study thatadministered oral cannabidiol (0, 200, 400, 800mg) alone and in combination with smoked marijuana (0.01%, 5.3-5.8% THC).

"Effect of photobiomodulation treatment in the sublingual, radial artery region, and along the spinal column in individuals with multiple sclerosis: Protocol for a randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial.",/pubmed/29742699,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease, for which the formsof treatment are medication and rehabilitation. However, in vitro and in vivostudies have demonstrated that photobiomodulation can be an effective treatmentmodality for inflammatory diseases, including MS. Photobiomodulation has a broad range of benefits, such as the avoidance of cell and tissue death, thestimulation of healing and injury repair, reductions in pain, edema andinflammation, cell proliferation, and even apoptosis. The outcomes ofphotobiomodulation include the regeneration of cells, the stimulation of thegrowth of Schwann cells, a reduction in spasticity, functional improvements, areduction in nitric oxide levels, and the upregulation of the cytokine IL10,demonstrating that this therapeutic modality can offer neuroprotection.METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is proposed. The patients will be divided into 6 groups. Groups 1 and 2 will receive sham andactive photobiomodulation in the sublingual region, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 will receive sham and active photobiomodulation along the spinal cord,respectively. Group 5 will receive placebo treatment with photobiomodulation onthe skin in the region of the radial artery with a specific bracelet.

Therefore,this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of two promisingnon-pharmacological treatments: cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) andmindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Furthermore, this study aims to gain additional knowledge about the aetiology of cognitive problems among MS patients,since this may help to develop and guide effective cognitive treatments.METHODS/DESIGN: In a dual-centre, single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT),120 MS patients will be randomised into one of three parallel groups: CRT, MBCTor enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). Both CRT and MBCT consist of a structured 9-week program. ETAU consists of one appointment with an MS specialist nurse.Measurements will be performed at baseline, post-intervention and 6¾months after the interventions.

Tolerability and efficacy of colestipol hydrochloride for accelerated elimination of teriflunomide.,/pubmed/29064296,"BACKGROUND: Teriflunomide is an oral disease modifying therapy approved for thetreatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Teriflunomide' spharmacokinetics (PK) contribute to its slow elimination, on average taking6-8¾months, though it can take up to 2¾years in some instances. This slowelimination can become problematic in certain clinical situations - such asduring pregnancy, when teriflunomide has potential teratogenic effects. In suchscenarios, an accelerated elimination procedure (AEP) is recommended. Currently, AEPs with oral cholestyramine or activated charcoal are available but arerestricted by adverse effects, limited administration routes, and dosingfrequencies.METHODS: A single-center, PK interaction study was performed in a total of 14healthy volunteers, to investigate colestipol hydrochloride (HCl) as analternative to cholestyramine for the elimination of teriflunomide. Participants received teriflunomide for 14¾days, followed by an AEP with colestipol HCl for15¾days.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The administration of colestipol HCl for 15¾days wassufficient to reduce plasma teriflunomide concentrations by greater than 96%.Although colestipol HCl did not completely eliminate teriflunomide with the same effectiveness as cholestyramine, it may offer an alternative method foraccelerated elimination of teriflunomide with potentially improved tolerabilityand more favorable dosing and administration options.",Single arm,Y,,,teriflunomide followed by colestipol hydrochloride,,,,healthy volunteers,plasma teriflunomide concentrations,
Successful long-term management of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis using a software application (APP): A pilot study.,/pubmed/29055449,"BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a very common syndrome in patients with multiplesclerosis (pwMS), but available treatments lead to sufficient symptom controlonly in one third.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of an individualized training program onimproving spasticity in a prospective pilot trial in pwMS suffering from moderatespasticity (defined as _ 4 on a normative rating scale; NRS).METHODS: PwMS were familiarized with predefined exercises targeting spasticitywhile undergoing inpatient rehabilitation (IR). After IR, 20 pwMS were 1:1randomized either to a newly designed APP-based home therapy program providingsuitable exercises on a daily basis or to a paper-based home therapy program for 3 months. At month 3, all patients received the APP-based home program foranother 3 months. Degree of spasticity was rated on the NRS.RESULTS: Undergoing inpatient rehabilitation for a mean of 32 days led to asignificant reduction in spasticity in pwMS (p = 0.00). Further self-trainingwith the APP-based home program for 3 months led to 1.2 lower mean NRS ascompared to training with the conventional paper-based program (p = 0.09).Spasticity was found to be on low levels again in both groups after 6 months.CONCLUSION: In pwMS, an individually tailored anti-spasticity program deliveredby a software APP is a feasible tool for increasing long-term adherence toself-training thereby positively impacting spasticity in pwMS.",RCT,,,,newly designed APP-based home therapy program,paper-based home therapy program,,,"multiple sclerosis suffering from moderatespasticity",Degree of spasticity,
Towards personalized therapy for multiple sclerosis: prediction of individual treatment response.,/pubmed/29050389,"Timely initiation of effective therapy is crucial for preventing disability inmultiple sclerosis; however, treatment response varies greatly among patients.Comprehensive predictive models of individual treatment response are lacking. Ouraims were: (i) to develop predictive algorithms for individual treatment responseusing demographic, clinical and paraclinical predictors in patients with multiplesclerosis; and (ii) to evaluate accuracy, and internal and external validity ofthese algorithms. This study evaluated 27 demographic, clinical and paraclinical predictors of individual response to seven disease-modifying therapies in MSBase,a large global cohort study. Treatment response was analysed separately fordisability progression, disability regression, relapse frequency, conversion tosecondary progressive disease, change in the cumulative disease burden, and theprobability of treatment discontinuation. Multivariable survival and generalized linear models were used, together with the principal component analysis to reducemodel dimensionality and prevent overparameterization. Accuracy of the individualprediction was tested and its internal validity was evaluated in a separate,non-overlapping cohort. External validity was evaluated in a geographicallydistinct cohort, the Swedish Multiple Sclerosis Registry. In the training cohort (n = 8513), the most prominent modifiers of treatment response comprised age,disease duration, disease course, previous relapse activity, disability,predominant relapse phenotype and previous therapy. Importantly, the magnitudeand direction of the associations varied among therapies and disease outcomes.Higher probability of disability progression during treatment with injectabletherapies was predominantly associated with a greater disability at treatmentstart and the previous therapy. For fingolimod, natalizumab or mitoxantrone, itwas mainly associated with lower pretreatment relapse activity. The probabilityof disability regression was predominantly associated with pre-baselinedisability, therapy and relapse activity. Relapse incidence was associated withpretreatment relapse activity, age and relapsing disease course, with thestrength of these associations varying among therapies. Accuracy and internalvalidity (n = 1196) of the resulting predictive models was high (>80%) forrelapse incidence during the first year and for disability outcomes, moderate forrelapse incidence in Years 2-4 and for the change in the cumulative diseaseburden, and low for conversion to secondary progressive disease and treatmentdiscontinuation. External validation showed similar results, demonstrating highexternal validity for disability and relapse outcomes, moderate external validityfor cumulative disease burden and low external validity for conversion tosecondary progressive disease and treatment discontinuation. We conclude thatdemographic, clinical and paraclinical information helps predict individualresponse to disease-modifying therapies at the time of their commencement.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were initially randomly assigned to receive everolimus 4.5 mg/m2/day (target blood trough 5-15 mg/dl) or placebo and could continue in an open-label extension phase. Angiomyolipomaresponse rates were analyzed in patients aged <18 years with _1 targetangiomyolipoma lesion at baseline. Response was defined as the proportion ofpatients with a _50% reduction in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomatafrom baseline, in the absence of new target angiomyolipomata, a >20% increase in kidney volume from nadir, and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding _ grade 2.Tolerability was also assessed.RESULTS: Overall, this analysis included 33 patients. Renal angiomyolipomaresponse was achieved by 75.8% of patients (95% confidence interval, 57.7-88.9%),with sustained mean reductions in renal angiomyolipoma volume over nearly 4 yearsof treatment. In addition, most (_80%) achieved clinically relevant reductions inangiomyolipoma volume (_50%), beginning at week 24 and continuing for theremainder of the study. Everolimus was generally well tolerated in this subgroup,with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 in severity.CONCLUSIONS: Although everolimus is currently not indicated for this use, thisanalysis from EXIST-1 demonstrates its long-term efficacy and safety for thetreatment of renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients undergoing treatment for TSC-associated SEGA.",Single arm,Y,,,everolimus,placebo,,,subependymal giant cell astrocytomas,Angiomyolipoma response rates,
Heart rate variability decreases after 3_months of sustained treatment with fingolimod.,/pubmed/28993873,"The objective is to prospectively investigate short- and mid-term changes ofheart rate variability (HRV) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiplesclerosis (RRMS), being started on fingolimod. In this prospective clinicaltrial, patient (n¾=¾33) with RRMS starting treatment with fingolimod underwent a time-domain-based analysis of HRV (breathing at rest, deep breath, and inresponse to the Valsalva maneuver) shortly before, 4.5¾h and 3¾months after firstintake. Blood pressure changes after the Valsalva maneuver were used as a marker of the sympathetic noradrenergic system. We used a non-invasive continuousbeat-to-beat heart rate and blood pressure monitoring. In addition, the FatigueSeverity Scale and the refined and abbreviated Composite Autonomic Symptom Score were applied. Significant changes in HRV in RRMS patients, following treatmentwith fingolimod, were detected. After an initial increase in HRV, measured 4.5¾h after the first intake of fingolimod, a substantial decrease in HRV occurredwithin 3¾months on continuous treatment. There is a growing body of evidence for short-term cardiovascular side effects in continuous treatment with fingolimod,driven by the ANS.

Evaluation of Intervention Fidelity in a Multisite Clinical Trial in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28991096,"BACKGROUND: Careful consideration of intervention fidelity is critical toestablishing the validity and reliability of research findings, yet such reports are often lacking in the research literature. It is imperative that intervention fidelity be methodically evaluated and reported to promote the translation ofeffective interventions into sound evidence-based practice.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to explore strategies used to promoteintervention fidelity, incorporating examples from a multisite clinical trial,that illustrate the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium's 5 domains for recommended treatment practices: (1) study design, (2) facilitatortraining, (3) intervention delivery, (4) intervention receipt, and (5)intervention enactment. A multisite randomized clinical trial testing theefficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention for adults with multiple sclerosis is used to illustrate strategies promoting interventionfidelity.METHODS: Data derived from audiotapes of intervention classes, audits of computerexercises completed by participants, participant class attendance, and goalattainment scaling suggested relatively high fidelity to the interventionprotocol.CONCLUSION: This study illustrates how to report intervention fidelity in theliterature guided by best practice strategies, which may serve to promotefidelity monitoring and reporting in future studies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Mii-vitaliSe: a pilot randomised controlled trial of a home gaming system (Nintendo Wii) to increase activity levels, vitality and well-being in people with multiple sclerosis.",/pubmed/28954791,"OBJECTIVES: While the health and well-being benefits of physical activity arerecognised, people with multiple sclerosis (MS) often face greater barriers than the general population. The Nintendo Wii potentially offers a fun, convenient wayof overcoming some of these. The aim was to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Mii-vitaliSe; ahome-based, physiotherapist-supported Nintendo Wii intervention.DESIGN: A single-centre wait-list randomised controlled study.SETTING: MS service in secondary care.PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory, relatively inactive people with clinically confirmedMS.INTERVENTION: Thirty participants were randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe either immediately (for 12 months) or after a 6-month wait (for 6 months). Mii-vitaliSe consisted of two supervised Nintendo Wii familiarisation sessions in the hospitalfollowed by home use (Wii Sports, Sports Resort and Fit Plus software) withphysiotherapist support and personalised resources.OUTCOMES: Included self-reported physical activity levels, quality of life, mood,self-efficacy, fatigue and assessments of balance, gait, mobility and handdexterity at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Interviews (n=25) explored participants' experiences and, at study end, the two Mii-vitaliSe facilitators' experiences of intervention delivery (main qualitative findings reported separately).RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (8.7) years, 90% female, with 47% diagnosed with MS <6 years ago and 60% new to active gaming. The recruitment rate was 31% (95%CI 20% to 44%). Outcome data were available for 29 (97%) at 6 months and 28 (93%)at 12 months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study.Qualitative data indicated that Mii-vitaliSe was well-received. Mean Wii useacross both groups over the initial 6-month intervention period was twice a week for 27_min/day. Mean cost of delivering Mii-vitaliSe was £684 per person.DISCUSSION: Mii-vitaliSe appears acceptable and a future trial feasible andwarranted.

Serum natalizumab and solublevascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were measured using immunoassays.Lymphocyte subsets, _4-integrin expression/saturation, and vascular cell adhesionmolecule-1 (VCAM-1) binding were assessed using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Blood lymphocyte counts (cells/L) in natalizumab-treated patientsincreased from 2.1 _ 109 to 3.5 _ 109. Starting 8 weeks post last natalizumabdose, lymphocyte counts became significantly lower in patients interruptingtreatment than in those continuing treatment (3.1 _ 109 vs 3.5 _ 109; p = 0.031),plateauing at prenatalizumab levels from week 16 onward. All measured cellsubpopulation, _4-integrin expression/saturation, and sVCAM changes demonstrated similar reversibility. Lymphocyte counts remained within the normal range.

Perceived Cognitive Deficits in a Sample of Persons Living With Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28885466,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to describe the nature and diversity ofperceived cognitive deficits using the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ), toassess the reliability of the PDQ, and to explore self-reported predictors of PDQscores in a large community-based sample of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Persons with MS enrolled in a randomized controlled trial provided demographic data and completed the PDQ along with measures of cognitive and memory strategies, cognitive abilities, self-efficacy, and depressivesymptoms and neuropsychological tests.RESULTS: Most of the 183 participants were non-Hispanic white women,approximately 49 years old, and diagnosed with MS 12.5 years prior. The mostfrequent cognitive complaints regarded trouble remembering telephone numbers,mind drifting, and forgetting why one came into a room. The PDQ scores weresignificantly related to self-rated cognitive abilities, depressive symptoms,self-efficacy, and use of cognitive strategies, but not to scores onneuropsychological performance tests. When controlling for other variables,self-rated cognitive abilities was the strongest, significant predictor ofperceived cognitive deficits.CONCLUSION: Persons with MS most frequently experience deficits related toshort-term memory and attention. The PDQ total is a reliable measure of perceivedcognitive deficits in persons with MS, is feasible for use by nurses in clinical settings-can be administered in approximately 5 minutes, and is easily scored.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Light therapy for multiple sclerosis-associated fatigue: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28885372,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom among multiplesclerosis (MS) patients, more than a quarter of whom consider fatigue to be theirmost disabling symptom. However, there are few effective treatment options forfatigue. We aim to investigate whether supplemental exposure to bright whitelight will reduce MS-associated fatigue.METHODS: Eligible participants will have clinically confirmed multiple sclerosis based on the revised McDonald criteria (2010) and a score _36 on the FatigueSeverity Scale (FSS). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to bright white light(10,000 lux; active condition) or dim red light (<300 lux; control condition)self-administered for 1 hour twice daily. The study will include a 2-weekbaseline period, a 4-week treatment period, and a 4-week washout period.Participants will record their sleep duration, exercise, caffeine, and medicationintake daily. Participants will record their fatigue using the Visual AnalogueFatigue Scale (VAFS) 4 times every third day, providing snapshots of theirfatigue level at different times of day. Participants will self-report theirfatigue severity using FSS on 3 separate visits: at baseline (week 0), following completion of the treatment phase (week 6), and at study completion (week 10).The primary outcome will be the change in the average FSS score after lighttherapy. We will perform an intention-to-treat analysis, comparing the active andcontrol groups to assess the postintervention difference in fatigue levelsreported on FSS. Secondary outcome measures include change in global VAFS scores during the light therapy and self-reported quality of life in the MultipleSclerosis Quality of Life-54.DISCUSSION: We present a study design and rationale for randomizing anonpharmacological intervention for MS-associated fatigue, using bright lighttherapy. The study limitations relate to the logistical issues of aself-administered intervention requiring frequent participant self-report in arelapsing condition.

A randomised controlled cross-over double-blind pilot study protocol on THC:CBD oromucosal spray efficacy as an add-on therapy for post-stroke spasticity.,/pubmed/28882919,"INTRODUCTION: Stroke is the most disabling neurological disorder and often causesspasticity. Transmucosal cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol(THC:CBD), Sativex) is currently available to treat spasticity-associatedsymptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. Cannabinoids are being considereduseful also in the treatment of pain, nausea and epilepsy, but may bear andincreased risk for cardiovascular events. Spasticity is often assessed withsubjective and clinical rating scales, which are unable to measure the increased excitability of the monosynaptic reflex, considered the hallmark of spasticity.The neurophysiological assessment of the stretch reflex provides a precise andobjective method to measure spasticity. We propose a novel study to understand ifSativex could be useful in reducing spasticity in stroke survivors andinvestigating tolerability and safety by accurate cardiovascular monitoring.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 50 patients with spasticity followingstroke to take THC:CBD in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study.Spasticity will be assessed with a numeric rating scale for spasticity, themodified Ashworth scale and with the electromyographical recording of the stretchreflex. The cardiovascular risk will be assessed prior to inclusion. Bloodpressure, heart rate, number of daily spasms, bladder function, sleep disruption and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. A mixed-model analysisof variance will be used to compare the stretch reflex amplitude between the timepoints; semiquantitative measures will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test(THC:CBD vs placebo) and Wilcoxon test (baseline vs treatment).ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was registered on the EudraCT database withnumber 2016-001034-10 and approved by both the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) and local Ethics Committee 'Comitato Etico Regionale della Liguria'.

Anti-inflammatory disease-modifying treatment and short-term disability progression in SPMS.,/pubmed/28794248,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of disease-modifying treatment on short-termdisability outcomes in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).METHODS: Using MSBase, an international cohort study, we previously validated ahighly accurate definition of SPMS. Here, we identified patients in MSBase whowere either untreated or treated with a disease-modifying drug when meeting this definition. Propensity score matching was used to select subpopulations withcomparable baseline characteristics. Disability outcomes were compared in paired,pairwise-censored analyses adjusted for treatment persistence, visit density, andrelapse rates.RESULTS: Of the 2,381 included patients, 1,378 patients were matchable (treated n= 689, untreated n = 689). Median pairwise-censored follow-up was 2.1 years(quartiles 1.2-3.8 years). No difference in the risk of 6-month sustaineddisability progression was observed between the groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.9,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.1, p = 0.27). We also did not find differencesin any of the secondary endpoints: risk of reaching Expanded Disability StatusScale (EDSS) score _7 (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.1, p = 0.10), sustained disabilityreduction (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.3, p = 0.79), or change in disability burden(area under the EDSS-time curve, _ = -0.05, p = 0.09). Secondary and sensitivity analyses confirmed the results.CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled analysis of the currently available disease-modifyingagents used after conversion to SPMS suggests that, on average, these therapieshave no substantial effect on relapse-unrelated disability outcomes measured bythe EDSS up to 4 years.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that forpatients with SPMS, disease-modifying treatment has no beneficial effect onshort-term disability progression.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,

Effect of photodynamic therapy in the reduction of halitosis in patients with multiple sclerosis: clinical trial.,/pubmed/28742057,"Smell and odours play a vital role in social interaction. Halitosis is a socialproblem that affects one third of the population, causing a negative impact onthe quality of life. There is little knowledge on the prevalence and managementof halitosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The present study aims toevaluate the presence of halitosis in patients with MS when compared to a controlgroup, and also evaluate treatment of the problem with antimicrobial photodynamictherapy (aPDT). This is a case-control clinical study in which 60 patients wereevaluated: 30 MS patients in treatment at the Specialties Clinic School ofMedicine, and 30 healthy patients, matched in age and gender for the controlgroup. Data was collected on the duration of the disease as well as the degree ofdisability and medication use in the MS group. For all patients, halitosis wasassessed with Oral ChromaÈ. Individuals with halitosis underwent treatment withtongue scraping and aPDT. The photosensitizer was methylene blue (0.005%) and aTHERAPY XT-ECÂ laser (660 nm, 9 J, 100 mW for 90 s per point, 320 J cm-2, 3537 mWcm-2) was used. Six points 1 cm apart from each other were irradiated in thetongue dorsum. There was a positive correlation between the disability anddisease duration. No parameter was correlated with halitosis. Patients with MShave higher levels of SH2 compounds when compared to the control group(p¾=¾0.003, Mann-Whitney), but after aPDT both groups significantly reduced thelevels to under the halitosis threshold. The aPDT scraping treatment waseffective in the immediate reduction of halitosis in both groups.",Single arm,Y,,,"tongue scraping and antimicrobial photodynamictherapy",,,,halitosis in multiple sclerosis,Levels of SH2 compounds,
Evaluation of the Impact of Cognitive Training on Quality of Life in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28738376,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitiverehabilitation in a group of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.METHODS: Thirty-four patients were included in this study and randomly allocated either to treatment with multidisciplinary rehabilitation plus cognitive trainingor to treatment with multidisciplinary rehabilitation alone.RESULTS: After 3 months of cognitive treatment, the patients assigned to therehabilitation plus cognitive training group displayed an improvement in thecognitive test of executive function and a marked improvement in quality of life (QoL). The patients treated with multidisciplinary rehabilitation withoutcognitive training improved in the physical composite score alone. Both groups ofpatients displayed an improvement in depression, though the improvement wasconfirmed at the 6-month follow-up examination (p¾= 0.036) only in patientstreated with multidisciplinary rehabilitation plus cognitive training.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the multidisciplinary rehabilitationtreatment is the best approach to treat MS. The specific effect of each treatmentneeds to be assessed to be able to determine its role within a multidisciplinary approach. Cognitive rehabilitation is an important aspect of thismultidisciplinary approach insofar as it may improve the QoL of MS people.",RCT,,,,multidisciplinary rehabilitation plus cognitive training,multidisciplinary rehabilitation,,,multiple sclerosis,cognitive test of executive function,

Seventy-fivepatients with early-stage MS were scanned monthly, over a period of 12-24 months,using 3T MRI after administration of triple-dose gadolinium. A total of 1,188scans were included in the analysis. A total of 139 were selected using an image pipeline algorithm that integrated the image information from cortical graymatter masks and gadolinium-enhancing lesion masks. These scans were evaluated toidentify gadolinium-enhancing lesions affecting the cortex.RESULTS: The total number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions was 2,044. The numberof gadolinium-enhancing lesions affecting the cortex was 120 (6%), 95% of whichwere leukocortical. The number of patients who showed gadolinium-enhancinglesions affecting the cortex was 27 (36%). The number of gadolinium-enhancinglesions affecting the cortex at baseline was 25 (21%) and the number of newlesions that developed in follow-up scans was 49 (41%). The number of persistent lesions was 46 (38%).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of enhancing lesions affecting the cortex and adjacent white matter, although transient and not frequent, suggests that at least somecortical lesions are related to blood-brain barrier disruption. Our data support the concept that there may be an acute inflammatory phase in the development ofleukocortical MS lesions.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00176592.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Metabolomic analysis identifies altered metabolic pathways in Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28720279,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease that affects thecentral nervous system and is characterized by a complex pathogenesis anddifficult management. The identification of new biomarkers would be clinicallyuseful for more accurate diagnoses and disease monitoring. Metabolomics, theidentification of small endogenous molecules, offers an instantaneous molecularsnapshot of the MS phenotype. Here the metabolomic profiles (utilizing plasmafrom patients with MS) were characterized with a Gas cromatography-massspectrometry-based platform followed by a multivariate statistical analysis andcomparison with a healthy control (HC) population. The obtained partial leastsquare discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model identified and validated significant metabolic differences between individuals with MS and HC (R2X=0.223, R2Y=0.82,Q2=0.562; p<0.001). Among discriminant metabolites phosphate, fructose,myo-inositol, pyroglutamate, threonate, l-leucine, l-asparagine, l-ornithine,l-glutamine, and l-glutamate were correctly identified, and some resulted asunknown. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with AUC 0.84 (p=0.01;CI: 0.75-1) generated with the concentrations of the discriminant metabolites,supported the strength of the model. Pathway analysis indicated asparagine andcitrulline biosynthesis as the main canonical pathways involved in MS. Changes inthe citrulline biosynthesis pathway suggests the involvement of oxidative stress during neuronal damage. The results confirmed metabolomics as a useful approachto better understand the pathogenesis of MS and to provide new biomarkers for thedisease to be used together with clinical data.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Sativex¬ effects on promoter methylation and on CNR1/CNR2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of progressive multiple sclerosis patients.,/pubmed/28716266,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating central nervous system (CNS)disease that involve oligodendrocyte loss and failure to remyelinate damagedbrain areas causing a progressive neurological disability. Studies in MS mousemodel suggest that cannabinoids ameliorate symptoms as spasticity, tremor andpain reducing inflammation via cannabinoid-mediated system. The aim of our study is to investigate the changes in cannabinoid type 1 (CNR1) and 2 (CNR2) receptorsmRNA expression levels and promoter methylation in peripheral blood mononuclearcells (PBMCs) of MS secondary progressive (MSS-SP) patients treated withSativexÂ. Our cohort included MSS-SP patients, that at the time of SativexÂtreatment, are treated (n=7), not treated (n=11) or that had terminatedinterferon-_-1b (IFN-_-1b) therapy (n=12). By Methylation Sensitive HighResolution Melting (MS-HRM), we characterized the methylation profile of CNR1 andCNR2 promoter region, while the relative mRNA transcript levels of these twogenes were evaluated in the same samples by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. We did not find different pattern of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)methylation in the CNR1/CNR2 promoter region of all MSS-SP patients treated with SativexÂ. In addition, CNR1 and CNR2 expression did not significantly differ inMSS-SP patients not treated with IFN-_-1b vs. them that have suspended, while in MSS-SP patients treated with IFN-_-1b during SativexÂ therapy we found a specificdecrease of the CNR2 expression levels.

FLS can lead to poor treatment adherence and early IFN_discontinuation. The involvement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the occurrence of FLShas been suggested. We hypothesized that cetirizine, a second-generationhistamine H1 receptor antagonist able to reduce the levels of IL-6, might improveIFN_-induced FLS.METHODS: We conducted a pilot, cross-over, randomized, placebo-controlled,double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of cetirizine 10 mg added after each IFN_ injection to the standard of care for FLS (acetaminophen or nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs) on FLS in patients with RRMS treated with IFN_. Patientswere randomized to two treatment sequences: 1) 4-week treatment with placeboadded to the standard treatment for FLS, followed by 4-week treatment withcetirizine added to the standard of care, and 2) first addition of cetirizine,then of placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change of FLSseverity [11-point visual analog scale (VAS)] after 4 weeks of treatment withineach sequence.RESULTS: Forty-five patients (71.1% female, mean age 39.1 years, mean time fromRRMS diagnosis 5.8 years) were randomized to treatment sequences 1 and 2. Thedifferences between cetirizine and placebo in the intensity of FLS were notstatistically significant: total mean VAS scores at 4 hours from IFN_ injectionwere 3.57 and 3.42 for cetirizine and placebo, respectively (difference -0.15;95% confidence interval: from -0.74 to 0.44; p = 0.6029).

Big conductance calcium-activated potassium channel openers control spasticity without sedation.,/pubmed/28677901,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our initial aim was to generate cannabinoid agents thatcontrol spasticity, occurring as a consequence of multiple sclerosis (MS), whilstavoiding the sedative side effects associated with cannabis. VSN16R wassynthesized as an anandamide (endocannabinoid) analogue in an anti-metaboliteapproach to identify drugs that target spasticity.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Following the initial chemistry, a variety of biochemical,pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches, using isolated cells,tissue-based assays and in vivo animal models, were used to demonstrate theactivity, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action of VSN16R.Toxicological and safety studies were performed in animals and humans.KEY RESULTS: VSN16R had nanomolar activity in tissue-based, functional assays anddose-dependently inhibited spasticity in a mouse experimental encephalomyelitismodel of MS. This effect occurred with over 1000-fold therapeutic window, withoutaffecting normal muscle tone. Efficacy was achieved at plasma levels that arefeasible and safe in humans. VSN16R did not bind to known CB1 /CB2 /GPPR55cannabinoid-related receptors in receptor-based assays but acted on a vascularcannabinoid target. This was identified as the major neuronal form of the bigconductance, calcium-activated potassium (BKCa ) channel. Drug-induced opening ofneuronal BKCa channels induced membrane hyperpolarization, limiting excessiveneural-excitability and controlling spasticity.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We identified the neuronal form of the BKCa channelas the target for VSN16R and demonstrated that its activation alleviates neuronalexcitability and spasticity in an experimental model of MS, revealing a novelmechanism to control spasticity. VSN16R is a potential, safe and selective ligandfor controlling neural hyper-excitability in spasticity.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacyof dual-lead thalamic DBS (one targeting the ventralis intermedius-ventralisoralis posterior nucleus border [the VIM lead] and one targeting the ventralisoralis anterior-ventralis oralis posterior border [the VO lead]) for thetreatment of multiple sclerosis tremor.METHODS: We did a single centre, single-blind, prospective, randomised pilottrial at the University of Florida Center for Movement Disorders andNeurorestoration clinic (Gainesville, FL, USA). We recruited adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis tremor refractory to previous medical therapy. Before surgery to implant both leads, we randomly assigned patients(1:1) to receive 3 months of optimised single-lead DBS-either VIM or VO. We didthe randomisation with a computer-generated sequence, using three blocks of four patients, and independent members of the Center did the assignment. Patients and all clinicians other than the DBS programming nurse were masked to the choice of lead. Patients underwent surgery 1 month after their baseline visit forimplantation of the dual lead DBS system. A pulse generator and two extensioncables were implanted in a second surgery 3-4 weeks later. Patients then receivedan initial 3-month period of continuous stimulation of either the VIM or VO lead followed by blinded safety assessment of their tremor with the Tolosa-Fahn-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) during optimised VIM or VO lead stimulation at the end of the 3 months. After this visit, both leads were activated in all patients for an additional 3 months, and optimally programmed during serial visits as dictatedby a prespecified programming algorithm. At the 6-month follow-up visit, TRSscore was measured, and mood and psychological batteries were administered under four stimulation conditions: VIM on, VO on, both on, and both off (the order oftesting was chosen by a computer-generated random sequence, assigned byindependent members of the centre, and enacted by an unmasked DBS programmingnurse). Each of four stimulation settings were tested over 4 consecutive days,with stimulation settings held constant for at least 12 h before testing. Theprimary outcome was change in mean total TRS score at the 6-month postoperativeassessment with both leads activated, compared with the preoperative baselinemean TRS score. Analysis was by intention to treat. Safety was analysed in allpatients who received the surgical implantation except in one patient whodiscontinued before the safety assessment. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00954421.FINDINGS: Between Jan 16, 2007, and Dec 17, 2013, we enrolled 12 patients whowere randomly assigned either to 3 initial months of VIM-only or VO-onlystimulation. One patient from the VO-only group developed an infectionnecessitating DBS explantation, and was excluded from the assessment of theprimary outcome. Compared with the mean baseline TRS score of 57à0 (SD 10à2), themean score at 6 months decreased to 40à1 (17à6), -29à6% reduction; t=-0à28,p=0à03. Three of 11 patients did not respond to surgical intervention. Onepatient died suddenly 2 years after surgery, but this was judged to be unrelated to DBS implantation. Serious adverse events included a superficial woundinfection in one patient that resolved with antibiotic therapy, and transientaltered mental status and late multiple sclerosis exacerbation in anotherpatient. The most common non-serious adverse events were headache and fatigue.INTERPRETATION: Dual lead thalamic DBS might be a safe and effective option forimproving severe, refractory multiple sclerosis tremor. Larger studies arenecessary to show whether this technique is widely applicable, safe in thelong-term, and effective in treating multiple sclerosis tremor or other severetremor disorders.FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health, the Cathy Donnellan, Albert EEinstein, and Birdie W Einstein Fund, and the William Merz Professorship.",RCT,,,,"dual-lead thalamic DBS (deep brain stimulation) targeting the ventralis intermedius-ventralisoralis posterior nucleus border",dual-lead thalamic DBS (deep brain stimulation) targeting the ventralis oralis anterior-ventralis oralis posterior border,,,refractory multiple sclerosis tremor,"change in mean total TRS (Tolosa-Fahn-Marin Tremor Rating Scale) score at the 6-month postoperative assessment",
Interpreting Lymphocyte Reconstitution Data From the Pivotal Phase 3 Trials of Alemtuzumab.,/pubmed/28604916,"Importance: Alemtuzumab, a CD52-depleting monoclonal antibody, effectivelyinhibits relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) but is associated with a highincidence of secondary B-cell autoimmunities that limit use. These effects may beavoided through control of B-cell hyperproliferation.Objective: To investigate whether the data describing the effect of alemtuzumabon lymphocyte subsets collected during the phase 3 trial program revealmechanisms explaining efficacy and the risk for secondary autoimmunity withtreatment of MS.Design, Setting, and Participants: Lymphocyte reconstitution data from regulatorysubmissions of the pivotal Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy inMultiple Sclerosis I and II (CARE-MS I and II) trials were obtained from theEuropean Medicines Agency via Freedom of Information requests. Data used in this study were reported from June 22 to October 12, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures: Tabulated data from T- and B-lymphocyte subsetanalysis and antidrug antibody responses were extracted from the supplieddocuments.Results: Alemtuzumab depleted CD4+ T cells by more than 95%, including regulatorycells (-80%) and CD8+ T cells (>80% depletion), which remained well belowreference levels throughout the trials. However, although CD19+ B cells wereinitially also depleted (>85%), marked (180% increase) hyperrepopulation ofimmature B cells occurred with conversion to mature B cells over time. Theselymphocyte kinetics were associated with rapid development of alemtuzumab-bindingand -neutralizing antibodies and subsequent occurrence of secondary B-cellautoimmunity. Hyperrepopulation of B cells masked a marked, long-term depletionof CD19+ memory B cells that may underpin efficacy in MS.Conclusions and Relevance: Although blockade of memory T and B cells may limitMS, rapid CD19+ B-cell subset repopulation in the absence of effective T-cellregulation has implications for the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab.Controlling B-cell proliferation until T-cell regulation recovers may limitsecondary autoimmunity, which does not occur with other B-cell-depleting agents.",Single arm,Y,,,Alemtuzumab,,,,relapsing multiple sclerosis ,T- and B-lymphocyte subset analysis and antidrug antibody responses,
Manufacture of Autologous CD34(+) Selected Grafts in the NIAID-Sponsored HALT-MS and SCOT Multicenter Clinical Trials for Autoimmune Diseases.,/pubmed/28602891,"To ensure comparable grafts for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation(HCT) in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsoredInvestigational New Drug protocols for multiple sclerosis (HALT-MS) and systemic sclerosis (SCOT), a Drug Master File approach to control manufacture wasimplemented, including a common Master Production Batch Record and site-specific standard operating procedures with ""Critical Elements."" We assessed comparabilityof flow cytometry and controlled rate cryopreservation among sites and stability of cryopreserved grafts using hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from healthy donors. Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells, Apheresis-CD34+ Enriched, for Autologous Use (Auto-CD34+HPC) graft specifications included _70% viable CD34+ cells before cryopreservation. For the 2 protocols, 110 apheresis collections were performed; 121 lots of Auto-CD34+HPC were cryopreserved, and 107 of these (88.4%) metrelease criteria. Grafts were infused at a median of 25 days (range, 17 to 68)post-apheresis for HALT-MS (n_=_24), and 25 days (range, 14 to 78) for SCOT(n_=_33). Subjects received precryopreservation doses of a median 5.1 __106viable CD34+ cells/kg (range, 3.9 to 12.8)_ for HALT-MS and 5.6 __106 viableCD34+ cells/kg (range, 2.6 to 10.2)_for SCOT. Recovery of granulocytes occurredat a median of 11 days (range, 9 to 15) post-HCT for HALT-MS and 10 days (range, 8 to 12) for SCOT, independent of CD34+ cell dose. Subjects received their lastplatelet transfusion at a median of 9 days (range, 6 to 16) for HALT-MS and 8days (range, 6 to 23) for SCOT; higher CD34+/kg doses were associated with fasterplatelet recovery. Stability testing of cryopreserved healthy donor CD34+ HPCsover 6 months of vapor phase liquid nitrogen storage demonstrated consistent 69% to 73% recovery of viable CD34+ cells.

"Effect of high-dose simvastatin on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and health-related quality-of-life measures in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: secondary analyses from the MS-STAT randomised, placebo-controlled trial.",/pubmed/28600189,"BACKGROUND: In the 24-month MS-STAT phase 2 trial, we showed that high-dosesimvastatin significantly reduced the annualised rate of whole brain atrophy inpatients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). We now describethe results of the MS-STAT cognitive substudy, in which we investigated thetreatment effect on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and health-relatedquality-of-life (HRQoL) outcome measures.METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of MS-STAT, a 24-month, double-blind,controlled trial of patients with SPMS done at three neuroscience centres in the UK between Jan 28, 2008, and Nov 4, 2011. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1)to either 80 mg simvastatin (n=70) or placebo (n=70). The cognitive assessmentsdone were the National Adult Reading Test, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale ofIntelligence, Graded Naming Test, Birt Memory and Information Processing Battery (BMIPB), Visual Object and Space Perception battery (cube analysis), FrontalAssessment Battery (FAB), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test.Neuropsychiatric status was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scaleand the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using theself-reported 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) version 2. Assessments were done at study entry, 12 months, and 24 months. Patients, treating physicians, andoutcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were by intentionto treat. MS-STAT is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00647348.FINDINGS: Baseline assessment revealed impairments in 60 (45%) of 133 patients onthe test of frontal lobe function (FAB), and in between 13 (10%) and 43 (33%) of 130 patients in tests of non-verbal and verbal memory (BMIPB). Over the entiretrial, we noted significant worsening on tests of verbal memory (T score decline of 5à7 points, 95% CI 3à6-7à8; p<0à0001) and non-verbal memory (decline of 6à8points, 4à8-8à7; p<0à0001). At 24 months, the FAB score was 1à2 points higher in the simvastatin-treated group than in the placebo group (95% CI 0à2-2à3). Thesimvastatin group also had a 2à5 points better mean physical component score ofthe SF-36 (95% CI 0à3-4à8; p=0à028). A treatment effect was not noted for anyother outcomes.INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this SPMS cohort is the largest studied to datewith comprehensive longitudinal cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and HRQoLassessments. We found evidence of a positive effect of simvastatin on frontallobe function and a physical quality-of-life measure. Although we found no effectof simvastatin on the other outcome measures, these potential effects warrantconfirmation and underline the importance of fully assessing cognition andquality of life in progressive multiple sclerosis treatment trials.FUNDING: The Moulton Foundation, the Berkeley Foundation, the Multiple Sclerosis Trials Collaboration, the Rosetrees Trust, a personal contribution from A WPidgley CBE, and the National Institute for Health Research University CollegeLondon Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre and University College London.",RCT,,,,simvastatin,placebo,,,secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,National Adult Reading Test,
Vitamin D(3) supplementation in multiple sclerosis: Symptoms and biomarkers of depression.,/pubmed/28566173,"Depressive symptoms are common in multiple sclerosis (MS), and both depressionand MS have been associated with a poor vitamin D status. As cytokine-mediatedinflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of both disorders, wehypothesized that vitamin D3 supplementation reduces depressive symptoms in MSvia its immunomodulatory properties. In this randomized pilot study relapsingremitting (RR) MS patients received either vitamin D3 supplementation (n=20;14.000IU/day) or placebo (n=20) during 48weeks. Pre- and post-supplementationdepression scores, measured using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)depression subscale (HADS-D), showed a significant decrease within the vitamin D3group (median HADS-D 4.0 to 3.0, p=0.02), a trend towards a decrease within theplacebo group (median HADS-D 3.0 to 2.0, p=0.06), but no significantly different reductions between groups (p=0.78). Furthermore, no reductions in pro- andanti-inflammatory cytokine balances, secreted by stimulated leukocytes and CD8+ Tcells, were found in the vitamin D3 compared to the placebo arm. Therefore, wefound no evidence for a reduction of depressive symptoms or related biomarkersupon vitamin D3 supplementation in RRMS patients in this exploratory study.Whether vitamin D3 supplementation is of benefit in manifest depression in MSneeds to be assessed by additional studies.",RCT,,,,vitamin D3 supplementation,placebo,,,relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)depression subscale (HADS-D)",
Trial of Minocycline in a Clinically Isolated Syndrome of Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28564557,"BACKGROUND: On the basis of encouraging preliminary results, we conducted arandomized, controlled trial to determine whether minocycline reduces the risk ofconversion from a first demyelinating event (also known as a clinically isolated syndrome) to multiple sclerosis.METHODS: During the period from January 2009 through July 2013, we randomlyassigned participants who had had their first demyelinating symptoms within theprevious 180 days to receive either 100 mg of minocycline, administered orallytwice daily, or placebo. Administration of minocycline or placebo was continueduntil a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was established or until 24 months after randomization, whichever came first. The primary outcome was conversion tomultiple sclerosis (diagnosed on the basis of the 2005 McDonald criteria) within 6 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes included conversion to multiple sclerosis within 24 months after randomization and changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 6 months and 24 months (change in lesion volume on T2-weightedMRI, cumulative number of new lesions enhanced on T1-weighted MRI [""enhancinglesions""], and cumulative combined number of unique lesions [new enhancinglesions on T1-weighted MRI plus new and newly enlarged lesions on T2-weightedMRI]).RESULTS: A total of 142 eligible participants underwent randomization at 12Canadian multiple sclerosis clinics; 72 participants were assigned to theminocycline group and 70 to the placebo group. The mean age of the participantswas 35.8 years, and 68.3% were women. The unadjusted risk of conversion tomultiple sclerosis within 6 months after randomization was 61.0% in the placebogroup and 33.4% in the minocycline group, a difference of 27.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.4 to 43.9; P=0.001). After adjustment for thenumber of enhancing lesions at baseline, the difference in the risk of conversionto multiple sclerosis within 6 months after randomization was 18.5 percentagepoints (95% CI, 3.7 to 33.3; P=0.01); the unadjusted risk difference was notsignificant at the 24-month secondary outcome time point (P=0.06). All secondary MRI outcomes favored minocycline over placebo at 6 months but not at 24 months.Trial withdrawals and adverse events of rash, dizziness, and dental discolorationwere more frequent among participants who received minocycline than among thosewho received placebo.CONCLUSIONS: The risk of conversion from a clinically isolated syndrome tomultiple sclerosis was significantly lower with minocycline than with placeboover 6 months but not over 24 months.

Sodium intake and multiple sclerosis activity and progression in BENEFIT.,/pubmed/28556498,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a high-salt diet, as measured by urinary sodiumconcentration, is associated with faster conversion from clinically isolatedsyndrome (CIS) to multiple sclerosis (MS) and MS activity and disability.METHODS: BENEFIT was a randomized clinical trial comparing early versus delayedinterferon beta-1b treatment in 465 patients with a CIS. Each patient provided a median of 14 (interquartile range = 13-16) spot urine samples throughout the5-year follow-up. We estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion level at each time point using the Tanaka equations, and assessed whether sodium levels estimatedfrom the cumulative average of the repeated measures were associated withclinical (conversion to MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) and magneticresonance imaging (MRI) outcomes.RESULTS: Average 24-hour urine sodium levels were not associated with conversion to clinically definite MS over the 5-year follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91,95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-1.24 per 1g increase in estimated dailysodium intake), nor were they associated with clinical or MRI outcomes (newactive lesions after 6 months: HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.97-1.13; relative change in T2 lesion volume: -0.11, 95% CI = -0.25 to 0.04; change in EDSS: -0.01, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.08; relapse rate: HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.56-1.07).

The patients were distributed in two groups: 16 to the experimentalgroup (combined cognitive training with aerobic exercises) and 16 patients to thecontrol group (aerobic exercises). The intervention was planned for six weekscombining cognitive tasks by means of a game of dynamic board of cubes and signs (TaDiCS Â) and a program of aerobic exercises. The Brief Repeatable Battery ofNeuropsychological Test and the Stroop Test were applied to evaluate thecognitive yield. Also, the Beck Depression Inventory was administered.RESULTS: There were found significant differences in the intergrupal analysisafter the intervention in the variable learning and visuoespacial long termmemory (p = 0.000), attention (p = 0.026) and inhibitory control (p = 0.007).Also, in the intragroup analysis there were found significant differences inthese variables and information processing speed in the group that received thecombined training.

Relationship between soluble CD25 and gene expression in healthy individuals and patients with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/28511943,"Genome wide association studies and fine mapping has established a firm linkbetween the IL2RA gene, encoding the interleukin-2 receptor _-chain CD25, andsusceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). We hypothesized that gene expressionin peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls (HCs) and MS patients are associated with IL2RA SNP rs2104286 and that gene expression levels correlate with soluble CD25 (sCD25) concentrations - that are affected byrs2104286. We used the Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 microarray to analyze geneexpression levels in PBMCs from 18 HCs and 51MS patients. Plasma concentrationsof sCD25 were measured by ELISA in all individuals. In HCs 266 genes correlatedwith sCD25 with Spearman's rho_0.707; 70 of these genes had a false discoveryrate (FDR) value of q<0.05. These genes were highest expressed in cells belongingto the innate immune system. Gene-networks were focused around NFKB1, TNF, BCL6and STAT1. Eighteen genes correlated with sCD25 with rho_0.707 in relapsingremitting MS versus 33 in secondary progressive and 34 in primary progressive MS.None had a FDR<0.05. Thirty-eight and 23 genes were differentially expressedbetween rs2104286 genotype-groups in MS patients and HCs respectively, howeverthey were not significant after FDR correction. Our study indicates thatrs2104286 influences gene expression in PBMCs in HCs as shown by the highcorrelations with the rs2104286-affected sCD25 protein. Correlations werestrongest in HCs suggesting that immunological alterations may obscure the roleof the IL2RA SNP rs2104286 in established MS.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reconstitution of immune cell populations in multiple sclerosis patients after autologous stem cell transplantation.,/pubmed/28498568,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. In aPhase II clinical trial, high-dose immunosuppressive therapy combined withautologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell transplant resulted in 69à2% ofsubjects remaining disease-free without evidence of relapse, loss of neurologicalfunction or new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions to year 5post-treatment.

At month 2, monocytes andnatural killer (NK) cells were proportionally more abundant, while CD4 T cellsand B cells were reduced, relative to baseline. In contrast to the changesobserved at earlier time-points in the T cell compartment, B cells wereproportionally more abundant and expansion in the proportion of naive B cells wasobserved 1 and 2 years post-therapy.

Although fatigue increases duringperiods of inflammation, for some patients it persists when disease is inremission. Compared to other long-term conditions where fatigue has beenextensively researched, optimal management of fatigue in patients with IBD isunknown and fatigue has rarely been the primary outcome in intervention studies. To date, interventions for the management of IBD-fatigue are sparse, haveshort-term effects and have not been implemented within the existing healthsystem. There is a need to integrate current best evidence across differentconditions, patient experience and clinical expertise in order to developinterventions for IBD-fatigue management that are feasible and effective.Modifying an existing intervention for patients with multiple sclerosis, thisstudy aims to assess the feasibility and initial estimates of efficacy of acognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for the management of fatigue inpatients with IBD.METHODS: The study will be a two-arm pilot randomised controlled trial. Patients will be recruited from one outpatient IBD clinic and randomised individually toeither: Group 1 (CBT manual for the management of fatigue, one 60-min session andseven 30-min telephone/Skype sessions with a therapist over an eight-weekperiod); or Group 2 (fatigue information sheet to use without therapist help).Self-reported IBD-fatigue (Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Fatigue Scale) andIBD-quality of life (United Kingdom Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire) andself-reported disease activity will be collected at baseline, three, six and12¾months post randomisation. Illness perceptions, daytime sleepiness, anxietyand depression explanatory variables will be collected only at three months post randomisation. Clinical and sociodemographic data will be retrieved from thepatients' medical notes. A nested qualitative study will evaluate patient andtherapist experience, and healthcare professionals' perceptions of theintervention.DISCUSSION: The study will provide evidence of the feasibility and initialestimates of efficacy of a CBT intervention for the management of fatigue inpatients with IBD. Quantitative and qualitative findings from the study willcontribute to the development and implementation of a large-scale randomisedcontrolled trial assessing the efficacy of CBT interventions for IBD-fatigue.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN17917944 .

The Effects of Gain- versus Loss-Framed Messages Following Health Risk Information on Physical Activity in Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28481157,"Few people with multiple sclerosis engage in physical activity. Messaginginterventions may motivate more physical activity among these individuals. Thepurpose of this online study was to evaluate an intervention presentingparticipants with multiple sclerosis (N¾=¾237) with risk information (i.e.,information demonstrating people with multiple sclerosis are more likely toexperience certain health issues) or no risk information followed by gain- orloss-framed physical activity messages. Participants completed questionnaires on Days 1, 6, and 28 and received information material on Days 2-5. The dependentvariables were as follows: physical activity intentions and behavior, responseand task efficacy, perceived threat (i.e., perception of threat to health issues relevant to people with multiple sclerosis), and avoidance (i.e., avoidingthinking about/doing something about the health issues presented in themessages). Analyses indicated physical activity and response efficacy increasedover time. Also, participants receiving risk information had higher levels ofphysical activity and perceived threat. However, manipulation checks showed nodifferences between participants regarding perceptions of risk information orgain/loss-framed messages. Despite the lack of impact of the framingintervention, this study suggests that a brief informational intervention canpositively influence physical activity and certain correlates of physicalactivity among people with multiple sclerosis.",RCT,,,,Intervention presenting participants with multiple sclerosis with risk information,No risk information followed by gain- or loss-framed messages,,,multiple sclerosis,Physical activity and response efficacy,
Robotic gait training in multiple sclerosis rehabilitation: Can virtual reality make the difference? Findings from a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28477702,"Gait, coordination, and balance may be severely compromised in patients withmultiple sclerosis (MS), with considerable consequences on the patient's dailyliving activities, psychological status and quality of life. For this reason, MS patients may benefit from robotic-rehabilitation and virtual reality trainingsessions. Aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of robot-assistedgait training (RAGT) equipped with virtual reality (VR) system in MS patientswith walking disabilities (EDSS 4.0 to 5.5) as compared to RAGT without VR. Weenrolled 40 patients (randomized into two groups) undergoing forty RAGT±VRsessions over eight weeks. All the patients were assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment by using specific scales. Effect sizes were very small andnon-significant between the groups for Berg Balance Scale (-0.019, CI95% -2.403to 2.365) and TUG (-0.064, 95%CI -0.408 to 0.536) favoring RAGT+VR. Effects were moderate-to-large and significant for positive attitude (-0.505, 95%CI -3.615 to 2.604) and problem-solving (-0.905, 95%CI -2.113 to 0.302) sub-items of CopingOrientation to Problem Experienced, thus largely favoring RAGT+VR. Our findingsshow that RAGT combined with VR is an effective therapeutic option in MS patientswith walking disability as compared to RAGT without VR. We may hypothesize thatVR may strengthen RAGT thanks to the entrainment of different brain areasinvolved in motor panning and learning.",RCT,,,,robot-assisted gait training equipped with virtual reality (VR),robot-assisted gait training equipped without virtual reality (VR),,,multiple scelorsis patients with walking disabilities,Berg Balance Scale,
Effects of Acupuncture on Gait of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28410453,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is considered a complex and heterogeneous disease.Approximately 85% of patients with multiple sclerosis indicate impaired gait asone of the major limitations in their daily life. Acupuncture studies found areduction of spasticity and improvement of fatigue and imbalance in patients withmultiple sclerosis, but there is a lack of studies regarding gait.DESIGN: We designed a study of acupuncture treatment, according to the Heidelbergmodel of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), to investigate if acupuncture can bea useful therapeutic strategy in patients with gait impairment in multiplesclerosis of relapsing-remitting type. The sample consisted of 20 individualswith diagnosis of multiple sclerosis of relapsing-remitting type. Gait impairmentwas evaluated by the 25-foot walk test.RESULTS: The results showed differences in time to walk 25 feet following trueacupuncture. In contrast, there was no difference in time to walk 25 feetfollowing sham acupuncture. When using true acupuncture, 95% of cases showed animprovement in 25-foot walk test, compared with 45% when sham acupuncture wasdone.CONCLUSIONS: Our study protocol provides evidence that acupuncture treatment can be an attractive option for patients with multiple sclerosis, with gaitimpairment.",RCT,,,,acupuncture,sham acupuncture,,,"gait impairment in multiplesclerosis of relapsing-remitting type",25-foot walk test,
Improving Patient-Centered Care by Assessing Patient Preferences for Multiple Sclerosis Disease-Modifying Agents: A Stated-Choice Experiment.,/pubmed/28406788,"CONTEXT: Long-term adherence to pharmaceutical treatment for multiple sclerosis(MS) is poor. A focus on patient preferences when determining the patient'stherapeutic plan may improve this experience.OBJECTIVE: To identify factors important to patients with MS when evaluatingtheir options for pharmaceutical agents that deliver disease-modifying therapy.DESIGN: Stated-choice experiment to a sample of patients with MS from privatelyand publicly insured enrollees in a regional health plan. The experimentpresented each respondent with a set of 8 drug choices for MS, asking them toselect their preferred disease-modifying agent (DMA). Each respondent wasrandomized to 1 of 6 possible sets of 8 drug choices, for a total of 48 drugpairings in the experiment. Each choice included 2 hypothetical DMAs and a ""nodrug"" option. Drug attributes included dosage type and modality, efficacy,relapse risk, and drug side effects.RESULTS: The ""no drug"" alternative was a stronger substitute than the alternativedrug when the focal drug characteristics changed, and the most important drivers of choice were type of side effects and risk of severe relapse.DISCUSSION: The heterogeneity of our sample and the inclusion of a ""no drug""alternative in the DMA choice scenarios make this study an important contributionto this body of literature. The importance of the ""no drug"" alternative in ourresults is consistent with poor long-term adherence to DMAs.CONCLUSION: Patient-centered MS therapy using DMAs should include discussion ofside effects and relapse risk.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A Multimodal, Nonpharmacologic Intervention Improves Mood and Cognitive Function in People with Multiple Sclerosis.",/pubmed/28394724,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether participation in a 12-month multimodal intervention would improve mood and cognitive function inadults with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).METHODS: In this one-arm, open-label feasibility trial, participants wereprescribed a home-based multimodal intervention, including (1) a modifiedPaleolithic diet; (2) an exercise program (stretching and strengthening of thetrunk and lower limb muscles); (3) neuromuscular electrical stimulation (EStim)of trunk and lower limb muscles; and (4) stress management (meditation andself-massage). Individuals completed measures of mood (Beck Anxiety andDepression Inventories) and cognitive (Cognitive Stability Index, CognitiveScreening Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System) and executive function(Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12¾months after the start of the intervention. Dosage of the multimodal intervention was assessedat 3, 6, 9, and 12¾months.RESULTS: The more individuals participated in the intervention activities, thegreater improvements they had from baseline to 12¾months on self-report measures of anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]; ps = 0.001 to 0.02), depression (BeckDepression Inventory [BDI]; ps = <0.0001 to 0.09), cognitive function (Cognitive Stability Index [CSI/T], Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [DKEFS]; ps =0.001 to 0.06), and executive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS];ps = <0.0001 to 0.09). Mood and cognitive improvements were more closely related to a higher intake of the modified Paleolithic diet than to exercise and stressmanagement dosage. Anxiety and depression changes were evident after just a fewmonths, whereas changes in cognitive function were generally not observed untillater in the intervention period. Mood and cognitive function changes frombaseline to 12¾months were significantly associated with fatigue improvements (ps= <0.0001 to 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: A modified Paleolithic diet, exercise, EStim, and stress management intervention like this one has the potential to improve the mood and cognitivesymptoms that can lead to considerable suffering in people with MS, potentiallyimproving quality of life and function for people with progressive MS.",Single arm,Y,,,home-based multimodal intervention,,,,progressive multiple sclerosis,"measures of mood (Beck Anxiety andDepression Inventories)",
Population-Based Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of Peginterferon Beta-1a in Patients With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28394418,"Peginterferon beta-1a reduced annualized relapse rate as compared with placeboand was approved to treat multiple sclerosis patients.

Body mass index was the mostsignificant covariate that impacted both clearance and volume of distribution,which in turn impacted area under the curve and maximum serum concentration.Cumulative monthly area under the curve and annualized relapse rate were bestdescribed by a Poisson-gamma (negative binomial) model, demonstrating that theimproved efficacy of every-2-weeks dosing was driven by greater drug exposure.The results supported the superior efficacy of the every-2-week dosing regimencompared with the every-4-weeks dosing regimen.",RCT,,,,Peginterferon beta-1a,placebo,,,multiple sclerosis,pharmacokinetics and annualized relapse rate,
Impact of an electronic monitoring device and behavioral feedback on adherence to multiple sclerosis therapies in youth: results of a randomized trial.,/pubmed/28393317,"PURPOSE: To report the results of a randomized controlled trial using anelectronic monitoring device (EM) plus a motivational interviewing (MI)intervention to enhance adherence to disease-modifying therapies (DMT) inpediatric MS.METHODS: Fifty-two youth with MS (16.03¾±¾2.2¾years) were randomized to receiveeither MI (n¾=¾25) (target intervention) or a MS medication video (n¾=¾27)(attention control). Primary endpoint was change in adherence. Secondary outcomesincluded changes in quality of life, well-being and self-efficacy. Random effectsmodeling and Cohen's effect size computation evaluated intervention impact.RESULTS: Longitudinal random effect models revealed that the MI group decreasedtheir EM adherence (GroupxTime interaction¾=¾-0.19), while increasing frequencyof parental DMT reminder (26.01)/administration (11.69). We found decreased EMuse in the MI group at 6¾months (Cohen's d¾=¾-0.61), but increased pharmacyrefill adherence (d¾=¾0.23).

High dose vitamin D supplementation does not affect biochemical bone markers in multiple sclerosis - a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28376767,"BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis have high risk of osteoporosis andfractures. A poor vitamin D status is a risk factor for MS, and vitamin Dsupplementation has been recommended both to prevent MS progression and tomaintain bone health.METHODS: We assessed the effect of 20,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly compared toplacebo on biochemical markers of bone metabolism in 68 persons with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis.RESULTS: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D more than doubled in the vitamin Dgroup, and parathyroid hormone decreased in the vitamin D group compared to theplacebo group at week 48 and week 96. There was however no effect on boneformation as measured by procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP), or on boneresorption as measured by C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen(CTX1). Neither PINP nor CTX1 predicted bone loss from baseline to week 96.CONCLUSIONS: These findings corroborate the previously reported lack of effect ofweekly high dose vitamin D supplementation on bone mass density in the samepatients, and suggest that such vitamin D supplementation does not prevent boneloss in persons with MS who are not vitamin D deficient.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on April 42008, registration number NCT00785473 .",RCT,,,,vitamin D3,placebo,,,relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,biochemical markers of bone metabolism,

"Protocol for a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial of Melatonin for treatment of Nocturia in adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MeNiMS).",/pubmed/28347292,"BACKGROUND: Nocturia (the symptom of needing to wake up to pass urine) is common in progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Moderate-to-severe nocturiaaffects quality of life, can exacerbate fatigue and may affect capacity to carry out daily activities. Melatonin is a natural hormone regulating circadian cycles,released by the pineal gland at night-time, and secretion is impaired in MS.Melatonin levels can be supplemented by administration in tablet form at bedtime.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of melatonin on mean number ofnocturia episodes per night in MS patients. Secondary outcome measures willassess impact upon quality of life, urinated volumes, lower urinary tractsymptoms (LUTS), cognition, sleep quality and sleep disturbance of partners.METHODS: A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trialconsisting of two, six week treatment phases (active drug melatonin 2¾mg orplacebo), with a 1¾month wash-out period in between. The primary outcome (change in nocturia episodes per night) in this two arm, two treatment, two periodcrossover design, will be objectively measured using frequency volume charts(FVC) at baseline and following both treatment phases.

Patient-reported questionnaires in MS rehabilitation: responsiveness and minimal important difference of the multiple sclerosis questionnaire for physiotherapists (MSQPT).,/pubmed/28302081,"BACKGROUND: The Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire for Physical Therapists (MSQPT) is a patient-rated outcome questionnaire for evaluating the rehabilitation ofpersons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Responsiveness was evaluated, and minimalimportant difference (MID) estimates were calculated to provide thresholds forclinical change for four items, three sections and the total score of the MSQPT.METHODS: This multicentre study used a combined distribution- and anchor-basedapproach with multiple anchors and multiple rating of change questions.Responsiveness was evaluated using effect size, standardized response mean (SRM),modified SRM and relative efficiency. For distribution-based MID estimates, 0.2and 0.33 standard deviations (SD), standard error of measurement (SEM) andminimal detectable change were used. Triangulation of anchor- anddistribution-based MID estimates provided a range of MID values for each of thefour items, the three sections and the total score of the MSQPT. The MID valueswere tested for their sensitivity and specificity for amelioration anddeterioration for each of the four items, the three sections and the total score of the MSQPT. The MID values of each item and section and of the total score withthe best sensitivity and specificity were selected as thresholds for clinicalchange. The outcome measures were the MSQPT, Hamburg Quality of LifeQuestionnaire for Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS), rating of change questionnaires, Expanded Disability Status Scale, 6-metre timed walking test, Berg Balance Scale and 6-minute walking test.RESULTS: The effect size ranged from 0.46 to 1.49. The SRM data showed comparableresults. The modified SRM ranged from 0.00 to 0.60. Anchor-based MID estimateswere very low and were comparable with SD- and SEM-based estimates. The MSQPT wasmore responsive than the HAQUAMS in detecting improvement but less responsive in finding deterioration. The best MID estimates of the items, sections and totalscore, expressed in percentage of their maximum score, were between 5.4%(activity) and 22% (item 10) change for improvement and between 5.7% (totalscore) and 22% (item 10) change for deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: The MSQPT is a responsive questionnaire with an adequate MID thatmay be used as threshold for change during rehabilitation of MS patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was retrospectively (01/24/2015) registered inClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02346279.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Potential Life-Threatening Reaction to Glatiramer Acetate in Rett Syndrome.,/pubmed/28254244,"BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordermanifesting with severe intellectual disability in females caused by variousmutations in the MECP2 gene. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one ofthe main proteins regulated by the MECP2 protein; its overexpression in the MeCP2mouse model partially corrects the Rett phenotype. Pharmacologic manipulationsthat lead to increased BDNF in individuals with Rett syndrome are expected tohave a positive effect on the disorder. Glatiramer acetate, a well-known and safemultiple sclerosis immune modulator, increases BDNF levels in multiple sclerosis animal models and patients responding to treatment, as well as in Rett mousemodels.METHODS: Fourteen patients with mutation-proven Rett syndrome were recruited for a clinical trial with glatiramer acetate. Baseline data and follow-up data werecollected during the trial, which had to be stopped because of a severe adverseevent. Our objective is to describe this unexpected potentially life-threatening event in response to glatiramer in patients with Rett syndrome.RESULTS: Four of 14 patients with Rett syndrome who were recruited and treatedwith daily injections of glatiramer acetate as part of an open-label clinicaltrial developed an exaggerated immediate postinjection response, which wasexperienced as life threatening in three of the patients, necessitating arrest ofthe trial.CONCLUSION: Despite the known safety profile of glatiramer acetate in adult andpediatric patients with multiple sclerosis, its use in Rett syndrome should becautiously reconsidered. The described severe adverse event can be related tothese patients' primary autonomic nervous system dysfunction.",Single arm,Y,,,Glatiramer acetate,,,,mutation-proven Rett syndrome,"unexpected potentially life-threatening event",
Time course of strength adaptations following high-intensity resistance training in individuals with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/28251398,"PURPOSE: No evidence exists regarding the time course and clinical relevance ofmuscle strength improvements following resistance training in people withmultiple sclerosis (PwMS). The purpose of this study was to investigate thetemporal course and the clinical meaningfulness of the changes in strengthinduced by high-intensity resistance training and whether these changes impact onmuscle endurance to fatigue and functional outcomes.METHODS: PwMS with predominantly unilateral hyposthenia of the ankle dorsiflexorsunderwent a 6-week isokinetic training of the more affected ankle dorsiflexionmuscles. Maximal strength was measured at baseline, during the training on aweekly basis, at the end of the intervention (POST) and at the 12-week follow-up.Muscle endurance to fatigue, mobility and walking outcomes were assessed atbaseline, POST and follow-up. Reproducibility and responsiveness analyses wereperformed.RESULTS: Significant gains in muscle strength were already detected after 3¾weeksof training with no further improvements in the following weeks. Theseimprovements exceeded the cutoff values for relevant changes and were alsopositively correlated to improved muscle endurance to fatigue and mobilitymeasures. None of the observed changes in muscle performance and functionaloutcomes was retained at the follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence showed that 3¾weeks of high-intensityresistance training induces consistent and meaningful improvements in muscleperformance of the ankle dorsiflexors in PwMS. These findings may have practical dose-response and cost-effectiveness implications in the management of MS-inducedmuscle weakness, potentially enhancing the understanding of the response totraining exhibited by PwMS.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02010398; December2013.",Single arm,Y,,,high-intensity resistance training,,,,multiple sclerosis,Maximal strength,

The aims of this study are: (1) to test theeffectiveness on gait speed, mobility, balance, fatigue and QoL of RAGT compared to conventional therapy (CT) in progressive MS and (2) to explore changes ofclinical and circulating biomarkers of neural plasticity.METHODS: This will be a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design withthe assessor blinded to the group allocation of participants. Ninety-eight (49per arm) progressive MS patients (EDSS scale 6-7) will be randomly assigned toreceive twelve 2-h training sessions over a 4-week period (three sessions/week)of either: (1) RAGT intervention on a robotic-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat,Hocoma, Switzerland). The training parameters (torque of the knee and hip drives,treadmill speed, body weight support) are set during the first session andprogressively adjusted during training progression or (2) individual conventionalphysiotherapy focusing on over-ground walking training performed with thehabitual walking device. The same assessors will perform outcome measurements at four time points: baseline (before the first intervention session); intermediate (after six training sessions); end of treatment (after the completion of 12sessions); and follow-up (after 3¾months from the end of the training program).The primary outcome is gait speed, assessed by the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. Wewill also assess walking endurance, balance, depression, fatigue and QoL as well as instrumental laboratory markers (muscle metabolism, cerebral venoushemodynamics, cortical activation) and circulating laboratory markers (rarecirculating cell populations pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines,growth factors, neurotrophic factors, coagulation factors, other plasma proteins suggested by transcriptomic analysis and metabolic parameters).DISCUSSION: The RAGT training is expected to improve mobility compared to theactive control intervention in progressive MS. Unique to this study is theanalysis of various potential markers of plasticity in relation with clinicaloutcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02421731 .

Immediate affective responses of gait training in neurological rehabilitation: A randomized crossover trial.,/pubmed/28218343,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the immediate effects of physical therapy androbotic-assisted gait training on affective responses of gait training inneurological rehabilitation.DESIGN: Randomized crossover trial with blinded observers.PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with neurological disorders (stroke, traumatic braininjury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis).METHODS: All patients underwent 2 single treatment sessions: physical therapy androbotic-assisted gait training. Both before and after the treatment sessions, theself-report Mood Survey Scale was used to assess the effects of the treatment on distinct affective states. The subscales of the Mood Survey Scale were tested forpre-post changes and differences in effects between treatments, usingnon-parametric tests.RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the study.

Flow cytometric analysis reveals the high levels of platelet activation parameters in circulation of multiple sclerosis patients.,/pubmed/28210898,"The epidemiological studies confirm an increased risk of cardiovascular diseasein multiple sclerosis, especially prothrombotic events directly associated withabnormal platelet activity. The aim of our study was to investigate the level of blood platelet activation in the circulation of patients with chronic phase ofmultiple sclerosis (SP MS) and their reactivity in response to typical platelets'physiological agonists. We examined 85 SP MS patients diagnosed according to the revised McDonald's criteria and 50 healthy volunteers as a control group. Theplatelet activation and reactivity were assessed using flow cytometry analysis ofthe following: P-selectin expression (CD62P), activation of GP IIb/IIIa complex(PAC-1 binding), and formation of platelet microparticles (PMPs) and plateletaggregates (PA) in agonist-stimulated (ADP, collagen) and unstimulated wholeblood samples. Furthermore, we measured the level of soluble P-selectin(sP-selectin) in plasma using ELISA method, to evaluate the in vivo level ofplatelet activation, both in healthy and SP MS subjects. We found a statisticallysignificant increase in P-selectin expression, GP IIb/IIIa activation, andformation of PMPs and PA, as well as in unstimulated and agonist-stimulated (ADP,collagen) platelets in whole blood samples from patients with SP MS in comparisonto the control group. We also determined the higher sP-selectin level in plasmaof SP MS subjects than in the control group. Based on the obtained results, wemight conclude that during the course of SP MS platelets are chronicallyactivated and display hyperreactivity to physiological agonists, such as ADP orcollagen.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Peginterferon beta-1a improves MRI measures and increases the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: 2-year results from the ADVANCE randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28183276,"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous peginterferon beta-1a has previously been shown toreduce the number of T2-hyperintense and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions over 2¾years in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and toreduce T1-hypointense lesion formation and the proportion of patients showingevidence of disease activity, based on both clinical and radiological measures,compared with placebo over 1¾year of treatment. The objectives of the currentanalyses were to evaluate T1 lesions and other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)measures, including whole brain volume and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of normal appearing brain tissue (NABT), and the proportions of patients with noevidence of disease activity (NEDA), over 2¾years.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the ADVANCE study received continuous peginterferonbeta-1a every 2 or 4¾weeks for 2¾years, or delayed treatment (placebo in Year 1; peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4¾weeks in Year 2). MRI scans were performed at baseline and Weeks 24, 48, and 96. Proportions of patients with NEDA werecalculated based on radiological criteria (absence of Gd_+_andnew/newly-enlarging T2 lesions) and clinical criteria (no relapse or confirmeddisability progression) separately and overall.RESULTS: Peginterferon beta-1a every 2¾weeks significantly reduced the number andvolume of T1-hypointense lesions compared with delayed treatment over 2¾years.Changes in whole brain volume and MTR of NABT were suggestive of pseudoatrophyduring the first 6¾months of peginterferon beta-1a treatment, which subsequently began to resolve. Significantly more patients in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2¾weeks group compared with the delayed treatment group met MRI-NEDA criteria(41% vs 21%; odds ratio [OR] 2.56; p_<_0.0001), clinical-NEDA criteria (71% vs57%; OR 1.90; p_<_0.0001) and achieved overall-NEDA (37% vs 16%; OR 3.09;p_<_0.0001).CONCLUSION: Peginterferon beta-1a provides significant improvements in MRImeasures and offers patients a good chance of remaining free from evidence ofMRI, clinical and overall disease activity over a sustained 2-year period.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00906399 ; Registered on: May 20,2009.",RCT,,,,"continuous peginterferonbeta-1a",delayed treatment (placebo),,,relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,T1 lesions and other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures,

Should learners reason one step at a time? A randomised trial of two diagnostic scheme designs.,/pubmed/28150431,"CONTEXT: Making a diagnosis can be difficult for learners as they must integrate multiple clinical variables. Diagnostic schemes can help learners with thiscomplex task. A diagnostic scheme is an algorithm that organises possiblediagnoses by assigning signs or symptoms (e.g. systolic murmur) to groups ofsimilar diagnoses (e.g. aortic stenosis and aortic sclerosis) and providesdistinguishing features to help discriminate between similar diagnoses (e.g.carotid pulse). The current literature does not identify whether scheme layoutsshould guide learners to reason one step at a time in a terminally branchingscheme or weigh multiple variables simultaneously in a hybrid scheme. We compareddiagnostic accuracy, perceptual errors and cognitive load using two schemelayouts for cardiac auscultation.METHODS: Focused on the task of identifying murmurs on Harvey, a cardiopulmonary simulator, 86 internal medicine residents used two scheme layouts. The terminallybranching scheme organised the information into single variable decisions. Thehybrid scheme combined single variable decisions with a chart integratingmultiple distinguishing features. Using a crossover design, participantscompleted one set of murmurs (diastolic or systolic) with either the terminallybranching or the hybrid scheme. The second set of murmurs was completed with the other scheme. A repeated measures manova was performed to compare diagnosticaccuracy, perceptual errors and cognitive load between the scheme layouts.RESULTS: There was a main effect of the scheme layout (Wilks' _ = 0.841, F3,80 = 5.1, p = 0.003). Use of a terminally branching scheme was associated withincreased diagnostic accuracy (65 versus 53%, p = 0.02), fewer perceptual errors (0.61 versus 0.98 errors, p = 0.001) and lower cognitive load (3.1 versus 3.5/7, p = 0.023).CONCLUSIONS: The terminally branching scheme was associated with improveddiagnostic accuracy, fewer perceptual errors and lower cognitive load, suggestingthat terminally branching schemes are effective for improving diagnosticaccuracy. These findings can inform the design of schemes and other clinicaldecision aids.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous HCT for relapsing-remitting MS.,/pubmed/28148635,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of multiple sclerosis(MS) disease stabilization after high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) andautologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).METHODS: High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is a phase II clinical trial of HDIT/HCT for patients withrelapsing-remitting (RR) MS who experienced relapses with disability progression (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 3.0-5.5) while on MS disease-modifyingtherapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), defined as survival without death or disease activity from any one of: disability progression,relapse, or new lesions on MRI. Participants were evaluated through 5 yearsposttransplant. Toxicities were reported using the National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AE).RESULTS: Twenty-five participants were evaluated for transplant and 24participants underwent HDIT/HCT. Median follow-up was 62 months (range 12-72).EFS was 69.2% (90% confidence interval [CI] 50.2-82.1).

Serum neurofilament is associated with progression of brain atrophy and disability in early MS.,/pubmed/28148632,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate a potential effect of riluzole on serum neurofilaments (Nf) compared to placebo and the relationship between longitudinal clinical andMRI outcomes and serum Nf levels.METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from participants enrolled in a randomizeddouble-blind trial of neuroprotection with riluzole vs placebo as an add-on toweekly interferon-_ (IFN-_)-1a IM initiated 3 months after randomization. Nfmeasurements were performed by ELISA and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.RESULTS: Longitudinal serum samples were available from 22 riluzole and 20placebo participants over 24 months. There was no observed treatment effect with riluzole. Nf light chain (NfL) levels decreased over time (p = 0.007 at 24months), whereas the Nf heavy chain was unchanged (p = 0.997). Changes in NfLwere correlated with EDSS change (p = 0.009) and neuropsychological outcomes.Brain volume decreased more rapidly in patients with high baseline NfL (p = 0.05 at 12 months and p = 0.008 at 24 months) and this relationship became stronger at24 months (p = 0.024 for interaction). Higher and increasing NfL predicted highernumber of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (p < 0.001 for both).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential value of serum NfL as a marker ofneuroaxonal injury in early multiple sclerosis. Its reduction over time couldrepresent regression to the mean, or a possible treatment effect of IFN-_-1a. Theassociation with whole brain atrophy and the formation of acute white matterlesions has relevant implications to use serum NfL as a noninvasive biomarker of the overall consequences of brain damage and ongoing disease activity.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00501943.",RCT,,,,riluzole,placebo,,,early multiple sclerosis,serum neurofilaments ,
Monitoring long-term efficacy of fampridine in gait-impaired patients with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/28148629,"OBJECTIVE: To expand upon the limited knowledge of the long-term effects ofprolonged-release (PR) fampridine in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS)regarding safety, walking improvements, and changes in drug responsiveness.METHODS: Fifty-three PwMS who completed the FAMPKIN core study were included inthis extension trial. Drug efficacy was assessed in an open-label and randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study design with regular baseline assessmentsover a period of 2 years using the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 6-Minute Walk Test(6MWT), and 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) as outcome measures.RESULTS: The data showed good tolerability and persisting efficacy of PRfampridine during long-term treatment in PwMS. Significant improvements inwalking speed, endurance, and self-perceived ambulatory function were observedduring open-label (T25FW: +11.5%; 6MWT: 10.7%; MSWS-12: 6.1 points) anddouble-blind controlled treatment with PR fampridine (T25FW: +13.1%; 6MWT: 11.9%;MSWS-12: 7.4 points). Several patients showed changes in drug responsiveness overtime, resulting in an increased proportion of patients exceeding 10% or 20%improvements in walking measures after long-term treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and tolerability data confirmed PR fampridine as a valuablelong-term treatment for improving ambulatory function in gait-impaired PwMS.Similar results in open-label and double-blind phases reveal that the walkingtests used are objective and reliable. The considerable proportion of patients inwhom responsiveness to PR fampridine changed over time emphasizes the importance of regular reassessment of drug efficacy in clinical practice to optimizetreatment. Such reassessments seem to be particularly important in patients with poor initial drug responses, as this group demonstrated enhanced responsivenessafter long-term treatment.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01576354.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that PRfampridine significantly improved gait compared to placebo in a 2-week study inPwMS who had been using PR fampridine for 2 years.",RCT,,,,prolonged-release (PR) fampridine,placebo,,,multiple sclerosis,Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW),
[Effect of cerebrolysin on remyelination processes in multiple sclerosis patients in stage of relapse regression].,/pubmed/28139626,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin (EVER Neuro Pharma GmbH,Austria) in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in stage ofrelapse regression.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 40 patients with remitting MS (McDonald criteria 2010) in stage of MS relapse regression after pulse therapy withmethylprednisolone 1000 mg/day 5. Patients randomized into 2 groups: group 1 (G1,n=20) received cerebrolysin 20 ml per 200 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution 1 times perday 10; Group 2 (G2, n=20) - only 200 ml 0.9% NaCl solution on analogical scheme.All patients before and 3-4 weeks after the treatment were carried out assessmentof vital signs, routine laboratory tests, tests of cognitive-motor functions(SDMT), visual acuity (LCAT), a comprehensive neurophysiological examinations(CNE). 4 patients in the G1 with presence of previously identified G+ lesions(G+L) were conducted MRI of brain after 3-4 weeks after treatment.RESULTS: In G1 the average age of the patients was 27.35 (5.65) years, the ratio of M/F - 40/60%, the duration of the disease 29.9 (11.01) months, the EDSS inrelapse stage - 3.5 [2.0; 4.5] points. The average age of patients in G2 was26.65 (4.93) years, the ratio of M/F - 35/65%, the duration of the disease -30.25 (11.98) months, the EDSS in relapse stage - 3.0 [1.5; 4.5] points. Clinicalrelapse of MS was categorized into groups as follows: optic neuritis (15% vs.30%; p=0.26), stem dysfunction (15% vs. 25%; p=0.43), hemispheric dysfunction(50% vs. 35%; p=0.34), transverse myelitis (20% vs. 10%; p=0.38). 17 patients(85%) in G1 and 18 patients (90%) in G2 completed a full course of treatment. In both groups showed significant regression estimation EDSS (2.0 [1.75; 2.5] vs.2.5 [1.75; 2.5]), while significant intergroup differences were not found(p=0.665). In G1 was noted more pronounced dynamics of performance improved intesting MSFC and SDMT (p=0.038 and p=0.026, respectively). Significant intergroupdifferences in the dynamics of improvement VCAT values were not found (p=0.658). Also in G1 was revealed greater regression of total variance in the CNE than G2(70.59% vs. 27.78%, p=0.028), while in almost all cases the previously identifiedneurophysiological abnormalities are not completely regressed. In addition to G1 was marked a tendency to reduce of progressive deterioration of CNE indicators(10% vs. 30%; p=0.228). On MRI cerebrolysin treatment was not associated with an increase of G+L (G+L number before treatment in 4 patients - 14, after treatment - 12), which indicates a potential anti-inducing effect of the drug on theintrathecal inflammation in MS.CONCLUSION: Cerebrolysin positive role in the stimulation of remyelinationprocess in MS has been confirmed by CNE and the selected treatment regimen hasdemonstrated its safety.

Long-term efficacy and safety of fingolimod in Japanese patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis: 3-year results of the phase 2 extension study.,/pubmed/28129749,"BACKGROUND: The low level of disease activity and manageable safety profile seen with fingolimod versus placebo in a 6-month, phase 2, randomized controlled trialin Japanese patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS; ClinicalTrials.govIdentifier NCT00537082) were maintained in the initial 6-month observationalstudy extension. Here, we report long-term safety and efficacy results of the3-year follow-up to the phase 2 study extension.METHODS: The 6-month core study was completed by 147 patients, of whom 143entered the extension and took at least one dose of fingolimod. Those originally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to fingolimod 1.25¾mg (n_=_23) or 0.5¾mg(n_=_27). During the extension, the patients taking fingolimod 1.25¾mg (n_=_46)were switched to open-label fingolimod 0.5¾mg, and those originally randomized tofingolimod 0.5¾mg (n_=_47) continued with open-label fingolimod 0.5¾mg.RESULTS: Continuous fingolimod treatment was associated with a sustained lowlevel of MRI and relapse activity for the duration of the extension phase;75-100% (range across all assessment time points up to end of study) of patients remained free of Gd-enhanced T1 lesions, 88-100% remained free of new/newlyenlarged T2 lesions, and 45-62% remained relapse-free. In patients who switchedto the active treatment, a 79.5% decrease in annualized relapse rate (ARR; from1.131 before switch to 0.232 6-months after switch) was observed in the first6¾months of the extension phase and thereafter remained low until the end ofstudy (0.16-0.31 across all assessment time points after switch up to end ofstudy).

The effect of Fampridine-SR on cognitive fatigue in a randomized double-blind crossover trial in patients with MS.,/pubmed/28104253,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive fatigue (CF) is a common complaint in persons with MS(PwMS). Fampridine-SR improves ambulation, fatigue and endurance, due toenhancing action potential formation by blocking potassium channels indemyelinated axons. Thus, through this same mechanism, it is hypothesized thatFampridine-SR could improve CF.OBJECTIVE: To determine if Fampridine-SR objectively improves CF in PwMS.METHODS: Sixty PwMS of any type with CF, defined as 3 or less correct responseswhen comparing the last third to the first third on the Paced Auditory SerialAddition Test (PASAT), were recruited from a tertiary care MS clinic in London(ON) Canada. Subjects also had to be between 18 and 64 years of age, inclusive,not had a relapse in the last 60 days or corticosteroids in the last 30 days,EDSS 0.0-7.0, and no other diagnosis that could cause cognitive impairment. Arandomized double blind crossover design was used: subjects were randomized toeither placebo or Fampridine-SR for 4 weeks, then after at least a one weekwashout, received the opposite treatment. Subjects were assessed before and aftereach treatment block. The primary outcome was the PASAT CF score after treatment with Fampridine-SR compared to placebo. T-tests and chi-square were used tocompare demographics between the two groups (placebo-Fampridine-SR vs. FampridineSR-placebo). Treatment effects were assessed using factorial ANOVA, withtreatment (Fampridine-SR vs. placebo) and time (before and after treatment) aswithin-subject variables.RESULTS: Of the 60 subjects randomized, 48 completed the study; three wereremoved due to an adverse event while in the treatment arm (one due to relapsewhile on placebo, one due to urinary retention and one due to dizziness andheadache while on Fampridine-SR). The subjects had a mean age of 46.5±10.0 years,education of 13.6±1.9 years, and were diagnosed with MS 10.6±9.6 years ago. Themajority were female (46, 76.7%), had relapsing remitting MS (41, 68.3%) withmedian EDSS of 3.5 (range 1.0-7.0). There were no significant demographicdifferences between the two groups. The treatment x time interaction within thefactorial ANOVA on PASAT CF scores was statistically significant, F(1, 45)=8.28, p=0.006, suggesting there is a difference between the treatments (placebo vs.Fampridine-SR), over the course of the study. An evaluation of the mean scoressuggests, however, that subjects saw a greater improvement when they were giventhe placebo, than when they were given the active medication. Similarly,individuals showed a greater increase in their information processing speed (asmeasured by the PASAT) over the course of treatment when they were given theplacebo, as compared with the active medication F(1,45)=4.17, p=0.047.CONCLUSION: Although this small pilot study does not suggest that Fampridine-SRresults in a statistically significant improvement of CF in MS patients, ascompared to placebo, individuals demonstrated an improvement in both information processing speed and CF, suggesting further studies are warranted.",RCT,,,,Fampridine-SR,placebo,,,multiple sclerosis,Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test scores,

Clinicalrelapses and safety were also assessed.RESULTS: New active lesions developed at a significantly lower mean rate innatalizumab-treated patients (0.06 lesions/24 weeks) than in placebo-treatedpatients (0.35 lesions/24 weeks) (p<0.001). The annualized relapse rate was 0.53 for natalizumab and 1.73 for placebo (p<0.001). Twice as many natalizumab-treatedpatients (79%) as placebo-treated patients (38%) were relapse-free (p<0.001). Thesafety, PK, and PD profiles of natalizumab in this study were consistent withdata in Caucasian RRMS patients.CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese RRMS patients, natalizumab treatment every 4 weeks for24 weeks was well tolerated and reduced the development of new brain lesions and relapses (Funded by Biogen; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01440101).",RCT,,,,natalizumab,placebo,,,relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"rate of development of new active lesions(gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 lesions) over 24 weeks",
Impact of daclizumab versus interferon beta-1a on patient-reported outcomes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/28104250,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide information on treatmenteffects from the patient's perspective that complement outcomes on clinicalmeasures. In DECIDE, daclizumab demonstrated superior efficacy in reducingrelapses, 24-week confirmed disability progression, and brain lesions (assessedby magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a inrelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of daclizumab versus interferon beta-1a on PROs in DECIDE.METHODS: DECIDE was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 study comparing daclizumab 150mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks with interferon beta-1a30mcg intramuscular once weekly. The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale(MSIS-29) and EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) were assessed at baseline and every 24weeks. Mean changes from baseline were analyzed using analysis of covariancemodels. Individual items for the MSIS-29 physical (PHYS) and psychological(PSYCH) subscales were analyzed post hoc.RESULTS: Daclizumab treatment resulted in greater mean improvements relative tobaseline in MSIS-29 PHYS and PSYCH scores starting at week 24 that persisted over96 weeks. Mean improvements from baseline in MSIS-29 PHYS and PSYCH scores weresignificantly greater for daclizumab versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a atweek 96.

Enantioselectivity in the Metabolism of Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Multiple or Systemic Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28083951,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the enantioselective pharmacokinetics ofcyclophosphamide and its metabolites 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide andcarboxyethylphosphoramide mustard in patients with systemic or multiplesclerosis. Patients with systemic sclerosis (n = 10) or multiple sclerosis (n =10), genotyped for the allelic variants of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 and of theCYP2B6 G516T polymorphism, were treated with 50 mg cyclophosphamide/kg daily for 4 days. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after administrationof the last cyclophosphamide dose. Cyclophosphamide, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide,and carboxyethylphosphoramide enantiomers were analyzed in plasma samples usingliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled to chiral column ChiralcelOD-R or Chiralpak AD-RH. Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL- 12p70,IL-17, TNF-_, and INT-_ in the plasma samples collected before cyclophosphamideinfusion were analyzed by Milliplex MAP human cytokine/chemokine.

Myxovirus Resistance Protein A mRNA Expression Kinetics in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated with IFN_.,/pubmed/28081207,"INTRODUCTION: Interferon-_ (IFN_) is the first-line treatment forrelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) is amarker of IFN_ bioactivity, which may be reduced by neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) against IFN_. The aim of the study was to analyze the kinetics of MxA mRNAexpression during long-term IFN_ treatment and assess its predictive value.METHODS: A prospective, observational, open-label, non-randomized study wasdesigned in multiple sclerosis patients starting IFN_ treatment. MxA mRNA wasassessed prior to initiation of IFN_ therapy and every three months subsequently.NAbs were assessed every six months. Assessment of relapses was scheduled everythree months during 24 months of follow up. The disease activity was correlatedto the pretreatment baseline MxA mRNA value. In NAb negative patients, clinicalstatus was correlated to MxA mRNA values.RESULTS: 119 patients were consecutively enrolled and 107 were included in thefinal analysis. There was no correlation of MxA mRNA expression levels betweenbaseline and month three. Using survival analysis, none of the selected baseline MxA mRNA cut off points allowed prediction of time to first relapse on thetreatment. In NAb negative patients, mean MxA mRNA levels did not significantlydiffer in patients irrespective of relapse status.CONCLUSION: Baseline MxA mRNA does not predict the response to IFN_ treatment or the clinical status of the disease and the level of MxA mRNA does not correlatewith disease activity in NAb negative patients.",Single arm,Y,,,Interferon-?,,,,relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,Myxovirus resistance protein A,

Descriptive statistics,logistic, truncated linear, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression modelswere used to estimate differences in income between SPMS, PPMS andrelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients.RESULTS: RRMS patients earned almost twice as much as PPMS and SPMS patients (on average SEK 204,500, SEK 114,500, and SEK 79,800 in 2010, respectively). Thedifference in earnings between PPMS and SPMS was not statistically significantwhen analyzed with multivariable regression. The estimated odds ratio for PPMSpatients to have income from earnings was not significantly different from SPMSpatients (95% CI 0.98 to 1.59). PPMS and RRMS patients were less likely toreceive benefits when compared to SPMS patients (by 6% and 27% lower,respectively).CONCLUSION: Our findings argue for similarities between PPMS and SPMS andhighlight the socioeconomic importance of preventing RRMS patients convert toSPMS.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Double-Blind Controlled Randomized Trial of Cyclophosphamide versus Methylprednisolone in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/28045953,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options are limited in secondary progressive multiplesclerosis (SPMS). Open-label studies suggested efficacy of monthly IVcyclophosphamide (CPM) without induction for delaying progression but norandomized trial was conducted so far.OBJECTIVE: To compare CPM to methylprednisolone (MP) in SPMS.METHODS: Randomized, double-blind clinical trial on two parallel groups. Patient with SPMS, with a documented worsening of the Expanded Disability Status Scale(EDSS) score during the last year and an EDSS score between 4à0 and 6à5 wererecruited and received one intravenous infusion of treatment (CPM: 750 mg /m2body surface area-MP: 1g) every four weeks for one year, and every eight weeksfor the second year. The primary endpoint was the time to EDSS deterioration,when confirmed sixteen weeks later, analyzed using a Cox model.RESULTS: Due to recruitment difficulties, the study was terminated prematurelyafter 138 patients were included (CPM, n = 72; MP, n = 66). In the CPM group, 33 patients stopped treatment prematurely, mainly due to tolerability, compared with22 in the MP group. Primary endpoint: the hazard ratio for EDSS deterioration in the CPM in comparison with the MP group was 0.61 [95% CI: 0à31-1à22](p = 0à16).According to the secondary multistate model analysis, patients in the CPM groupwere 2.2 times more likely ([1à14-4.29]; p = 0.02) to discontinue treatment than those in the MP group and 2.7 times less likely (HR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17-0.84; p = 0.02) to experience disability progression when they did not stop treatmentprematurely.

Natalizumab-Related Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in Multiple Sclerosis: Findings from an Italian Independent Registry.,/pubmed/27997580,"BACKGROUND: The monoclonal antibody natalizumab (NTZ) is a highly effectivetreatment for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, this drug isassociated with increased risk of developing Progressive MultifocalLeukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic infection of central nervous system(CNS) caused by the John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV).OBJECTIVE: To describe the 12-month clinical course of 39 patients with MS (28women, 11 men) who developed NTZ-related PML after a mean exposure of 39infusions.METHODS: An Italian independent collaborative repository initiative collected andanalyzed socio-demographic, clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data andnumber of JCV-DNA copies detected on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples ofpatients diagnosed as affected by NTZ-related PML. The evolution of disability,measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, was assessed at NTZ start, atPML diagnosis and after 2, 6 and 12 months from PML diagnosis. The effect ofclinical and paraclinical characteristics at PML diagnosis on the final outcomewas also investigated.RESULTS: Ten patients (25.6%) were diagnosed before 24 NTZ infusions. In sixcases (15.4%) the PML suspect was made on the basis of highly suggestive MRIfindings in absence of any detectable change of clinical conditions (asymptomaticPML). In patients with symptomatic PML, the diagnosis was quicker for those whopresented with cognitive symptoms (n = 12) rather than for those with otherneurological pictures (n = 21) (p = 0.003). Three patients (7.7%) died during the12-month observation period, resulting in a survival rate of 92.3%. Asymptomatic PML, more localized brain involvement and gadolinium-enhancement detected at MRI,as well as lower viral load were associated with a better disability outcome(p-values<0.01).CONCLUSION: Our findings support that early PML diagnosis, limited CNSinvolvement and initial signs of immune restoration are associated with a better outcome and higher survival rate, and confirm the utility of MRI as asurveillance tool for NTZ-treated patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Supplementary icons indicate the corresponding group's actualcondition. The study used an application showing effects of immunotherapyintended to slow disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). In a four-armweb-based randomized controlled trial, CLARIFIG was compared to the referencestandard, multifigure pictographs (MFP), regarding comprehension (primaryoutcome) and processing time. Both formats were presented as static and animated versions. People with MS were recruited through the website of the German MSsociety.RESULTS: Six hundred and eighty-two patients were randomized and analysed for theprimary end point. There were no differences in comprehension rates (MFPstatic=46%, CLARIFIGstatic =44%; P=.59; MFPanimated =23%, CLARIFIGanimated =30%;P=.134).

Consideration of absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat (NNT) provides an alternative approach toassess the magnitude of treatment effect and can provide valuable additionalinformation on therapeutic gain. Using data from pivotal studies of DMF (DEFINE, NCT00420212; CONFIRM, NCT00451451), fingolimod (FREEDOMS, NCT00289978; FREEDOMSII, NCT00355134), and teriflunomide (TEMSO, NCT00134563; TOWER, NCT00751881), we calculated NNTs to prevent any relapse, more severe relapses (such as thoseleading to hospitalization or requiring intravenous corticosteroids), anddisability worsening. Higher relative reductions were reported for DMF andfingolimod vs placebo on overall relapse and relapses requiring intravenouscorticosteroids in both individual and pooled studies (pooled data unavailablefor fingolimod). However, NNTs for each outcome were similar for DMF andteriflunomide, with marginally lower NNTs observed with fingolimod. By contrast, for relapses requiring hospitalization, relative reductions were higher and NNTs were substantially lower for teriflunomide compared with DMF. For fingolimod,there were inconsistent outcomes between the two studies for relapses requiringhospitalization; thus, comparative conclusions against DMF or teriflunomidecannot be clearly established. The risk of disability worsening was significantlyreduced in both teriflunomide studies, but only in a single study for DMF(DEFINE) and fingolimod (FREEDOMS). NNTs to prevent one patient from experiencingdisability worsening were similar in DEFINE, FREEDOMS, and TEMSO and TOWER butwere higher in CONFIRM and FREEDOMS II. This NNT analysis demonstrates broadlycomparable effects for DMF, fingolimod, and teriflunomide across key clinicaloutcomes. These observations are clinically relevant and may help to informtreatment decisions by providing additional information on therapeutic gainbeyond informal assessments of relative reductions alone.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Effect of slow release-Fampridine on muscle strength, rate of force development, functional capacity and cognitive function in an enriched population of MS patients. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study.",/pubmed/27919481,"DESIGN: This study was conducted as a randomized, double blind,placebo-controlled parallel group trial preceded by open label enrichment phase.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were 1) to examine the effect ofSR-Fampridine treatment on muscle strength in terms of maximal voluntarycontraction (MVC) and rate of force development (RFD) of the lower extremitiesand 2) to replicate previously published data on the effect of slowrelease-Fampridine (SR-Fampridine) on the functional capacity of the lower limbs,the upper limb and cognitive function, in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).METHODS: Previously identified responders to SR-Fampridine were randomized to SR-Fampridine or placebo treatment for four weeks. On days 0 and 26-28 participants underwent testing by isokinetic dynamometry, Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), SymbolDigit Modalities Test (SDMT), Six Spot Step Test (SSST), Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FW) and 5-Times Sit-to-Stand (5-STS).RESULTS: A statistical significant effect of SR-Fampridine on MVC wasdemonstrated during knee extension, knee flexion and hip flexion of the weakestleg, as well as on RFD during knee extension and knee flexion of the weakest leg.Furthermore, a significant effect of SR-Fampridine on T25FW, SSST and 5-STS wasdemonstrated.CONCLUSION: Gold standard dynamometry assessment of muscle strength showedimproved MVC and RFD in persons with MS treated with SR-Fampridine compared toplacebo. Furthermore, previous findings on the effects of SR-Fampridine onfunctional capacity of the lower limbs were replicated.

Results of a feasibility randomised controlled study of the guidelines for exercise in multiple sclerosis project.,/pubmed/27916699,"There is increasing recognition that exercise is an efficacious strategy formanaging many consequences of multiple sclerosis (MS), yet persons with MS arenot engaging in sufficient exercise for accruing health benefits. Poor exerciseuptake might be associated with the design of previous research. We conducted arandomised controlled trial (RCT) for examining the feasibility of a 4-monthhome-based, exercise-training program designed based on recent physical activity guidelines for MS and supplemented by behavioural strategies for compliance.Feasibility was assessed in the domains of process (e.g., recruitment), resource (e.g., monetary costs), management (e.g., personnel time requirements) andscientific outcomes (e.g., treatment effect). We recruited persons withmild-to-moderate MS who were randomised into an intervention or wait-list controlcondition. Intervention participants received a pedometer, elastic resistancebands, DVD, training manual, calendars, log-book, video coaching calls andnewsletters. Participants in both conditions completed home-based assessmentsbefore and after the 4-month period. Ninety-nine persons with MS were assessedfor eligibility, and 57 were randomised. Fifty-one persons completed the study(90%). Total costs of the study were US $5331.03. Personnel time to conduct thestudy totaled 263h. Participants in the intervention group complied fully with71% of all exercise sessions. There was a moderate increase in self-reportedexercise behaviour of the intervention participants as measured by the GodinLeisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (d_0.5). The results support the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based exercise intervention based on physicalactivity guidelines and supplemented with behavioural strategies for adults with mild-to-moderate MS.",RCT,,,,"home-based, exercise-training program",wait-list control,,,multiple sclerosis,Total costs,
"Amaze: a double-blind, multicentre randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding an ablation device-based maze procedure as an adjunct to routine cardiac surgery for patients with pre-existing atria",/pubmed/29701167,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be treated using a maze procedure duringplanned cardiac surgery, but the effect on clinical patient outcomes, and thecost-effectiveness compared with surgery alone, are uncertain.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not the maze procedure is safe, improvesclinical and patient outcomes and is cost-effective for the NHS in patients with AF.DESIGN: Multicentre, Phase III, pragmatic, double-blind, parallel-arm randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised on a 1_:_1 basis using random permutedblocks, stratified for surgeon and planned procedure.SETTING: Eleven acute NHS specialist cardiac surgical centres.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged __18 years, scheduled for elective or in-house urgentcardiac surgery, with a documented history (>_3 months) of AF.INTERVENTIONS: Routine cardiac surgery with or without an adjunct maze procedure administered by an AF ablation device.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were return to sinus rhythm (SR) at12 months and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 2 years afterrandomisation. Secondary outcomes included return to SR at 2 years, overall andstroke-free survival, drug use, quality of life (QoL), cost-effectiveness andsafety.RESULTS: Between 25 February 2009 and 6 March 2014, 352 patients were randomised to the control (n_=_176) or experimental (n_=_176) arms. The odds ratio (OR) for return to SR at 12 months was 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.54;p_=_0.0091]. The mean difference (95% CI) in QALYs at 2 years between the twotrial arms (maze/control) was -0.025 (95% CI 0.129 to 0.078; p_=_0.6319). The OR for SR at 2 years was 3.24 (95% CI 1.76 to 5.96). The number of patientsrequiring anticoagulant drug use was significantly lower in the maze arm from 6months after the procedure. There were no significant differences between the twoarms in operative or overall survival, stroke-free survival, need forcardioversion or permanent pacemaker implants, New York Heart AssociationFunctional Classification (for heart failure), EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version score and Short Form questionnaire-36 items score at any time point.Sixty per cent of patients in each trial arm had a serious adverse event(p_=_1.000); most events were mild, but 71 patients (42.5%) in the maze arm and84 patients (45.5%) in the control arm had moderately severe events; 31 patients (18.6%) in the maze arm and 38 patients (20.5%) in the control arm had severeevents. The mean additional cost of the maze procedure was £3533 (95% CI £1321 to£5746); the mean difference in QALYs was -0.022 (95% CI -0.1231 to 0.0791). Themaze procedure was not cost-effective at £30,000 per QALY over 2 years in anyanalysis. In a small substudy, the active left atrial ejection fraction wassmaller than that of the control patients (mean difference of -8.03, 95% CI-12.43 to -3.62), but within the predefined clinically equivalent range.LIMITATIONS: Low recruitment, early release of trial summaries and intermittentresource-use collection may have introduced bias and imprecise estimates.CONCLUSIONS: Ablation can be practised safely in routine NHS cardiac surgicalsettings and increases return to SR rates, but not survival or QoL up to 2 years after surgery. Lower anticoagulant drug use and recovery of left atrial function support anticoagulant drug withdrawal provided that good atrial function isconfirmed.FURTHER WORK: Continued follow-up and long-term clinical effectiveness andcost-effectiveness analysis.

Effect of intralipid on myocardial injury during valve replacement surgery with concomitant radiofrequency ablation: A randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/29505549,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intralipidpostconditioning (ILPC) on myocardial damage in patients undergoing valvereplacement surgery with concomitant radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for atrialfibrillation (AF).METHODS: Randomized patient and assessor-blind controlled trial conducted inadult patients undergoing valve replacement surgery with concomitant RFA.Sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to ILPC group (n_=_34) or controlgroup (n_=_35): ILPC group received an intravenous infusion of 20% intralipid(2_mL/kg) just 10_minutes before aortic cross-unclamping, and control groupreceived an equivalent volume of normal saline. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT)and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was measured before surgery and at 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72_hours after surgery. The primary endpoints were the 72-hour area under thecurve (AUC) for cTnT and CK-MB.RESULTS: The total 72-hour AUC of cTnT (P_=_.33) and CK-MB (P_=_.52) werecomparable between 2 groups. The left ventricle ejection fraction at discharge(P_=_.011) was higher in the ILPC group than that in the control group, while theAF recurrence did not differ significantly between 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: There was no observed beneficial effect of ILPC on myocardial injurydocumented by the cardiac biomarkers in patients undergoing valve replacementsurgery with concomitant RFA, and the effect of intralipid against myocardial I/Rinjury is undetectable within the background of massive biomarker releasefollowing ablation owing to localized myocardial necrosis. Besides, there are no other published data about the cardioprotective role of intralipid in patientsundergoing this procedure and benefits of this protection need further studies tovalidate.",RCT,,,,intralipid postconditioning,control group,,,atrial fibrillation,72-hour area under the curve (AUC) for cTnT and CK-MB,
A new clinical decision support tool for improving the adequacy of anticoagulant therapy and reducing the incidence of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: A randomized clinical trial in primary care.,/pubmed/29504981,"INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and increases the risk of ischemic stroke 4 to 5-fold. The first choice ofanticoagulant therapy (AT) is the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Contraindication toVKA or poor control of the International Normalized Ratio leads to theadministration of direct-acting oral anticoagulants. There is a trend towardinadequate AT in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) patients.AIM: To evaluate the impact of the implementation of a decision support toollinked to the digital clinical history on the adequacy of AT, the incidence ofcomplications, and the mortality in patients with NVAF in primary care centers(PCCs) of the Catalan Institute of Health (ICS).METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomized clinical trial in 287 PCCs, formed by 2 groups(intervention and control).POPULATION: patients controlled in PCCs, diagnosed with NVAF 1 year before theimplementation of the decision support tool and with VKA treatment over a minimumof 1 year. A simple randomization method will be performed at a sector level. Thedecision support tool will be available for 1 year. The time in therapeutic range(TTR) will be available in the digital clinical history only to professionals of the intervention group. The information system for primary care researchdevelopment database will be used for the data extraction.

Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation with Heart Failure.,/pubmed/29385358,"BACKGROUND: Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrialfibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone.Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means ofimproving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment.METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, hadunacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergoeither catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythmcontrol) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-basedtherapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% orless, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite ofdeath from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end pointoccurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in themedical-therapy group (51 patients [28.5%] vs. 82 patients [44.6%]; hazard ratio,0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P=0.007). Significantly fewerpatients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4%] vs. 46 [25.0%];hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P=0.01), were hospitalized forworsening heart failure (37 [20.7%] vs. 66 [35.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI,0.37 to 0.83; P=0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2%] vs. 41[22.3%]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P=0.009).CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heartfailure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end pointof death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than wasmedical therapy.

Patients With Undetermined Stroke Have Increased Atrial Fibrosis: A Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,/pubmed/29371431,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Some patients with ischemic strokes that are currentlyclassified as having an undetermined cause may have structural or functionalchanges of the left atrium (LA) and left atrial appendage, which increase theirrisk of thromboembolism. We compared the LA and left atrial appendage of patientswith different ischemic stroke causes using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: We prospectively included a consecutive sample of ischemic strokepatients. Patients with structural changes on echocardiography currentlyconsidered as causal for stroke in the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute StrokeTreatment (TOAST) classification were excluded. A 3-T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed.RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients were evaluated. Patients with anundetermined cause had a higher percentage of LA fibrosis (P=0.03) than patients with other stroke causes and lower, although not statistically significant,values of LA ejection fraction. Patients with atrial fibrillation andundetermined stroke cause showed a similar value of atrial fibrosis.CONCLUSIONS: The LA phenotype that was found in patients with undetermined cause supports the hypothesis that an atrial disease may be associated with stroke.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Time-to-Effect-Based Dosing Strategy for Cryoballoon Ablation in Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Results of the plusONE Multicenter Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial.,/pubmed/29247029,"BACKGROUND: The optimal dosage of cryotherapy during cryoballoon ablation ofpulmonary veins is still unclear. This trial tested the noninferiority of anovel, individualized, cryotherapy-dosing strategy for each vein.METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, randomized, multicenter, noninferioritystudy included 140 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which wasrefractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned to aconventional strategy of 180-second cryoballoon applications per vein with abonus freeze (control group, n=70) or to a shorter-time application protocol,with 1 application that lasted the time required for electric block time toeffect plus 60- and a 120-second freeze bonus (study group, n=70). Patients were followed with a long-term monitoring system of 30 days. At 1-year follow-up, nodifference was observed in terms of free atrial fibrillation-recurrence rates:79.4% in control versus 78.3% in study group (_=1.15%; 90% confidence interval,-10.33% to 12.63%; P=0.869). Time to effect was detected in 72.1% of veins. Thecontrol and study groups had similar mean number of applications per patient(9.6±2 versus 9.9±2.4; P=0.76). Compared with controls, the study group had asignificantly shorter cryotherapy time (28.3±7 versus 19.4±4.3 minutes; P<0.001),left atrium time (104±25 versus 92±23 minutes; P<0.01), and total procedure time (135±35 versus 119±31 minutes; P<0.01).

Prognostic Significance of Blood Pressure Variability on Beat-to-Beat Monitoring After Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke.,/pubmed/29229726,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visit-to-visit and day-to-day blood pressure (BP)variability (BPV) predict an increased risk of cardiovascular events but onlyreflect 1 form of BPV. Beat-to-beat BPV can be rapidly assessed and might also bepredictive.METHODS: In consecutive patients within 6 weeks of transient ischemic attack ornondisabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study), BPV (coefficient of variation) wasmeasured beat-to-beat for 5 minutes (Finometer), day-to-day for 1 week on homemonitoring (3 readings, 3_ daily), and on awake ambulatory BP monitoring. BPVafter 1-month standard treatment was related (Cox proportional hazards) torecurrent stroke and cardiovascular events for 2 to 5 years, adjusted for meansystolic BP.RESULTS: Among 520 patients, 26 had inadequate beat-to-beat recordings, and 22patients were in atrial fibrillation. Four hundred five patients had all forms ofmonitoring. Beat-to-beat BPV predicted recurrent stroke and cardiovascular eventsindependently of mean systolic BP (hazard ratio per group SD, stroke: 1.47[1.12-1.91]; P=0.005; cardiovascular events: 1.41 [1.08-1.83]; P=0.01), includingafter adjustment for age and sex (stroke: 1.47 [1.12-1.92]; P=0.005) and all riskfactors (1.40 [1.00-1.94]; P=0.047). Day-to-day BPV was less strongly associated with stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29 [0.97-1.71]; P=0.08) but similarly with cardiovascular events (1.41 [1.09-1.83]; P=0.009). BPV on awake ambulatory BPmonitoring was nonpredictive (stroke: 0.89 [0.59-1.35]; P=0.59; cardiovascularevents: 1.08 [0.77-1.52]; P=0.65). Despite a weak correlation (r=0.119; P=0.02), beat-to-beat BPV was associated with risk of recurrent stroke independently ofday-to-day BPV (1.41 [1.05-1.90]; P=0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Beat-to-beat BPV predicted recurrent stroke and cardiovascularevents, independently of mean systolic BP and risk factors but short-term BPV on ambulatory BP monitoring did not.

Predictors of perioperative major bleeding in patients who interrupt warfarin for an elective surgery or procedure: Analysis of the BRIDGE trial.,/pubmed/29224638,"BACKGROUND: The use of low-molecular weight heparin bridge therapy duringwarfarin interruption for elective surgery/procedures increases bleeding. Otherpredictors of bleeding in this setting are not well described.METHODS: BRIDGE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ofbridge therapy with dalteparin 100 IU/kg twice daily in patients with atrialfibrillation requiring warfarin interruption. Bleeding outcomes were documentedfrom the time of warfarin interruption until up to 37 days postprocedure.Multiple logistic regression and time-dependent hazard models were used toidentify major bleeding predictors.RESULTS: We analyzed 1,813 patients of whom 895 received bridging and 918received placebo. Median patient age was 72.6 years, and 73.3% were male.Forty-one major bleeding events occurred at a median time of 7.0 days(interquartile range, 4.0-18.0 days) postprocedure. Bridge therapy was a baselinepredictor of major bleeding (odds ratio [OR]=2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-4.8), as were ahistory of renal disease (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0), and high-bleeding riskprocedures (vs low-bleeding risk procedures) (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-5.9).Perioperative aspirin use (OR=3.6, 95% CI: 1.1-11.9) and postprocedureinternational normalized ratio >3.0 (OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.5-3.1) were time-dependentpredictors of major bleeding. Major bleeding was most common in the first 10 dayscompared with 11-37 days postprocedure (OR=3.5, 95% CI: 1.8-6.9).CONCLUSIONS: In addition to bridge therapy, perioperative aspirin use,postprocedure international normalized ratio >3.0, a history of renal failure,and having a high-bleeding risk procedure increase the risk of major bleedingaround the time of an elective surgery/procedure requiring warfarin interruption.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Laser Balloon or Wide-Area Circumferential Irrigated Radiofrequency Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: A Multicenter Prospective Randomized Study.,/pubmed/29217521,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone of ablation forpersistent atrial fibrillation (AF). The role of balloon catheters in thispatient population remains ill defined. We sought to compare efficacy and safety of the laser balloon (LB) with wide-area circumferential pulmonary vein isolationusing irrigated radiofrequency current (RF) ablation and 3-dimensional mapping.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 6 European centers, patients with persistent AF wereprospectively randomized. Follow-up included 3-day Holter ECG recordings andoffice visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary efficacy end point was freedom from AF between 90 and 365 days after a single ablation. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of any periprocedural complications. Of 152 enrolledpatients, 134 (n=68 LB and 66 RF; 63% men; mean age, 66+10 years) with persistentAF (median AF history, 14 months; Q1-Q3, 7-36 months) underwent pulmonary veinisolation and completed the entire follow-up.

Pharmacologic Prevention of Incident Atrial Fibrillation: Long-Term Results From the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial).,/pubmed/29212812,"BACKGROUND: Although atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines indicate thatpharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may be considered forprimary AF prevention in hypertensive patients, previous studies have yieldedconflicting results. We sought to determine whether randomization to lisinoprilreduces incident AF or atrial flutter (AFL) compared with chlorthalidone in alarge clinical trial cohort with extended post-trial surveillance.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a secondary analysis of the ALLHAT(Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial that enrolledhypertensive individuals _55 years of age with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine,lisinopril, or chlorthalidone.

Letermovir is an antiviral drugthat inhibits the CMV-terminase complex.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assignedCMV-seropositive transplant recipients, 18 years of age or older, in a 2:1 ratio to receive letermovir or placebo, administered orally or intravenously, throughweek 14 after transplantation; randomization was stratified according to trialsite and CMV disease risk. Letermovir was administered at a dose of 480 mg perday (or 240 mg per day in patients taking cyclosporine). Patients in whomclinically significant CMV infection (CMV disease or CMV viremia leading topreemptive treatment) developed discontinued the trial regimen and receivedanti-CMV treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients, amongpatients without detectable CMV DNA at randomization, who had clinicallysignificant CMV infection through week 24 after transplantation. Patients whodiscontinued the trial or had missing end-point data at week 24 were imputed ashaving a primary end-point event. Patients were followed through week 48 aftertransplantation.RESULTS: From June 2014 to March 2016, a total of 565 patients underwentrandomization and received letermovir or placebo beginning a median of 9 daysafter transplantation. Among 495 patients with undetectable CMV DNA atrandomization, fewer patients in the letermovir group than in the placebo grouphad clinically significant CMV infection or were imputed as having a primaryend-point event by week 24 after transplantation (122 of 325 patients [37.5%] vs.103 of 170 [60.6%], P<0.001). The frequency and severity of adverse events weresimilar in the two groups overall. Vomiting was reported in 18.5% of the patientswho received letermovir and in 13.5% of those who received placebo; edema in14.5% and 9.4%, respectively; and atrial fibrillation or flutter in 4.6% and1.0%, respectively. The rates of myelotoxic and nephrotoxic events were similarin the letermovir group and the placebo group. All-cause mortality at week 48after transplantation was 20.9% among letermovir recipients and 25.5% amongplacebo recipients.CONCLUSIONS: Letermovir prophylaxis resulted in a significantly lower risk ofclinically significant CMV infection than placebo. Adverse events with letermovirwere mainly of low grade.

Off-pump versus On-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Frail Patients: Study Protocol for the FRAGILE Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/29211225,"INTRODUCTION: Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer andhealthier lives. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored asa risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomizedcontrolled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients.Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique inpatients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress. In this study, the authors introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized,controlled trial ""FRAGILE"", to be developed in the main cardiac surgery centersof Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in frail patients.METHODS: FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individuallyrandomized (1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blindedoutcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), whichaims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump versus on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successfulresuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, andcoronary reintervention. Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac andcerebrovascular events, operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamicshock, new onset of atrial fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperationfor bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay inhospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of completerevascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery, quality oflife after cardiac surgery and costs.DISCUSSION: FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior toconventional on-pump CABG in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frailpatients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02338947.

Combined Cryoballoon and Radiofrequency Ablation Versus Radiofrequency Ablation Alone for Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/29208256,"BACKGROUND: To achieve sinus rhythm, ablation of long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) usually requires substrate modification in addition topulmonary vein isolation (PVI). In the present article, we aimed to compareclinical and substrate modification effects of 2 distinct PVI strategies duringstepwise ablation in patients with LSPAF: (1) Combined approach: cryoballoon (CB)for PVI and radiofrequency (RF) ablation for substrate modification and (2)RF-only approach: RF ablation for both PVI and substrate modification.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 34 patients were divided into 2 groups: 19 inthe combined group and 15 in the RF group. Left atrial (LA) complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) maps were acquired before and after PVI and comparedbetween groups. The groups were compared for acute atrial fibrillationtermination (AFT) rates and long-term arrhythmia-free survival.RESULTS: A significant reduction on total LA CFAE area was observed with PVI inboth groups. In the CB group, when pulmonary veins were excluded, the reductionof LA CFAE area was the most significant on the posterior wall of left atrium andwhich was greater than in the RF group. Although the ratio of AFT was higher inthe CB group (44% versus 33%, respectively), single-procedure arrhythmia-freesurvival at 1 year was comparable between groups (68% in the CB group versus 66% in the RF group). Times of total procedure, fluoroscopy and post-PVI RF were all shorter in the CB group.CONCLUSIONS: CB may cause greater substrate modification on the posterior walland increase AFT rate during LSPAF ablation.",RCT,,,,cryoballoon (CB) for PVI and radiofrequency (RF) ablation for substrate modification,radiofrequency (RF) ablation for both PVI and substrate modification,,,long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation,acute atrial fibrillation termination (AFT) rates,
Complications After Self-expanding Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.,/pubmed/29195573,"Procedural complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are usually reported as retrospectiveanalyses. We report the first comparison of complications following SAVR orself-expanding TAVR from a prospectively randomized study of high-risk SAVRpatients. Three hundred ninety-five TAVR and 402 SAVR patients were prospectivelyenrolled and randomized 1:1 to TAVR with a CoreValve bioprosthesis or a surgical bioprosthetic valve. The rates of major procedural and vascular complicationsoccurring (periprocedurally (0-3 days) and early (4-30 days)) were compared forTAVR vs SAVR patients. All-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, andmajor infection were similar in both periods post procedure. Within 0-3 days, themajor vascular complication rate was significantly higher with TAVR (P_=_0.003). Life-threatening or disabling bleeding (P_<_0.001), encephalopathy (P_=_0.02),atrial fibrillation (P_<_0.001), and acute kidney injury (P_<_0.001) weresignificantly higher with SAVR. Non-iliofemoral TAVR approaches had a higherincidence of major or life-threatening or disabling bleeding at 0-3days(P_<_0.05). Procedural complications unique to TAVR included coronary occlusion0.5% (2) and TAVR pop outs 2.8% (11) with no valve embolizations. Pop outs weresimilar between iliofemoral 2.8% (9/324) and non-iliofemoral approaches 3.0%(2/66). Procedural complications unique to SAVR included aortic dissection 0.8%(3/357) and injury to other heart structures 2.0% (7/357). The proceduralcomplication profiles of TAVR and SAVR are unique. Intraoperative deaths wereseen in TAVR only. Mortality at 3 and 30 days was similar.

Primary endpoints were responder rate defined as 50%reduction in migraine attacks and adverse events. Secondary endpoints includedreduction in migraine days and efficacy in patients with versus without aura.RESULTS: Of 1,653 subjects consented, 230 were enrolled. There was no difference in responder rate in the PFO closure (45 of 117) versus control (33 of 103)groups. One serious adverse event (transient atrial fibrillation) occurred in 205subjects who underwent PFO closure.

"Determinants of Informal Care, Burden, and Risk of Burnout in Caregivers of Stroke Survivors: The CONOCES Study.",/pubmed/29183953,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this article was to analyze the likelihood of receiving informal care after a stroke and to study the burden and risk ofburnout of primary caregivers in Spain.METHODS: The CONOCES study is an epidemiological, observational, prospective,multicenter study of patients diagnosed with stroke and admitted to a Stroke Unitin the Spanish healthcare system. At 3 and 12 months post-event, we estimated thetime spent caring for the patient and the burden borne by primary caregivers.Several multivariate models were applied to estimate the likelihood of receiving informal caregiving, the burden, and the likelihood of caregivers being at a highrisk of burnout.RESULTS: Eighty percent of those still alive at 3 and 12 months poststroke werereceiving informal care. More than 40% of those receiving care needed a secondarycaregiver at 3 months poststroke. The likelihood of receiving informal care wasassociated with stroke severity and the individual's health-related quality oflife. When informal care was provided, both the burden borne by caregivers andthe likelihood of caregivers being at a high risk of burnout was associated with (1) caregiving hours; (2) the patient's health-related quality of life; (3) theseverity of the stroke measured at discharge; (4) the patient having atrialfibrillation; and (5) the degree of dependence.CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the heavy burden borne by the caregivers ofstroke survivors. Our analysis also identifies explanatory and predictivevariables for the likelihood of receiving informal care, caregiver burden, andhigh risk of burnout.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Investigator training and supervision anddata monitoring were conducted by the US site (Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston).RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3±14.7 years, 67.2% men. The median admissionNational Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10 (interquartile range,5-15) and 24.5% had National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale _16. Hypertension (60.8%), diabetes mellitus (35.7%), and tobacco use (32.2%, includingbidi/smokeless tobacco) were common risk factors. Only 4% had atrialfibrillation. All patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonanceimaging; 81% had cerebrovascular imaging. Stroke etiologic subtypes were largeartery (29.9%), cardiac (24.9%), small artery (14.2%), other definite (3.4%), andundetermined (27.6%, including 6.7% with incomplete evaluation). Intravenous orintra-arterial thrombolysis was administered in 13%. In-hospital mortality was7.9%, and 48% achieved modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2 at 90 days. Onmultivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus predicted poor 3-month outcome andyounger age, lower admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale andsmall-artery etiology predicted excellent 3-month outcome.CONCLUSIONS: These comprehensive and novel clinical imaging data will proveuseful in refining stroke guidelines and advancing stroke care in India.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Type of Atrial Fibrillation and Outcomes in_Patients With Heart Failure and Reduced_Ejection_Fraction.,/pubmed/29145948,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in heart failure (HF), but theoutcome by type of AF is largely unknown.OBJECTIVES: This study investigated outcomes related to type of AF (paroxysmal,persistent or permanent, or new onset) in 2 recent large trials in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction.METHODS: The study analyzed patients in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective comparisonof ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in¾Patients withHeart Failure) trials. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes related to AF type.RESULTS: Of 15,415 patients, 5,481 (35.6%) had a history of AF at randomization, and of these, 1,645 (30.0%) had paroxysmal AF. Compared with patients without AF,patients with paroxysmal AF at randomization had a higher risk of the primarycomposite endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (HR: 1.20; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.09 to 1.32; p¾< 0.001), HF hospitalization (HR: 1.34;95% CI: 1.19 to 1.51; p¾< 0.001), and stroke (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.76;p¾=¾0.037), whereas the corresponding risks in patients with persistent orpermanent AF were not elevated. Neither type of AF was associated with highermortality.

"STABLE-SR (Electrophysiological Substrate Ablation in the Left Atrium During Sinus Rhythm) for the Treatment of Nonparoxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: A Prospective, Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial.",/pubmed/29141843,"BACKGROUND: Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) alone or combinedwith adjuvant substrate modifications is unsatisfactory for atrial fibrillation(AF) control in nonparoxysmal AF patients. Ablation targeting the fibrotic areas after CPVI (STABLE-SR [Electrophysiological Substrate Ablation in the Left AtriumDuring Sinus Rhythm]) is a newly evolved substrate modification strategy.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, randomized clinical trial, 229symptomatic nonparoxysmal AF patients were 1:1 randomized to STABLE-SR group(n=114) or conventional STEPWISE group (n=115). In the STABLE-SR group, afterCPVI, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm, leftatrial high-density mapping was performed. Areas with low-voltage and complexelectrogram were further homogenized and eliminated, respectively. Dechannelingwould be done if necessary. In the STEPWISE group, additional linear lesions and defragmentation were performed.The primary end point was freedom from documented atrial tachyarrhythmias for _30 s after a single ablation procedure withoutantiarrhythmic medications at 18 months. At 18 months, 74.0% of the patients inthe STABLE-SR group and 71.5% in the STEPWISE group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95%confidence interval, 0.47-1.29; P=0.325) achieved success according tointention-to-treat analysis. However, less procedure time (186.8±52.7 versus210.5±48.0 minutes, P<0.001), reduced post-CPVI fluoroscopic time (11.0±7.8versus 13.7±8.9 minutes, P=0.006), and shorter energy delivery time (60.1±25.1versus 75.0±24.3 minutes, P<0.001) were observed in the STABLE-SR group compared with the STEPWISE group.CONCLUSIONS: STABLE-SR is a simplified, personalized, and effective ablationstrategy in nonparoxysmal AF patients.

Mean age was 64.3±10 and 64.2±11 years. Mean time intherapeutic range was progressively lower with reducing CrCl strata, being 66.8% in those with CrCl >30 to _50 compared with 71.8% in those with CrCl _80. Theodds ratios for the primary efficacy and safety end points were comparable forthe different predefined renal function strata; given the small numbers, the 95% CI included 1.0. In the subset of those with CrCl _95, the odds ratios showedconsistency with the other CrCl strata. When CrCl was assessed as a continuousvariable, there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher major or clinicallyrelevant nonmajor bleeding with reducing CrCl levels, with no significantdifferences between the 2 treatment arms.

5-Year Outcomes After Left Atrial Appendage Closure: From the PREVAIL and PROTECT AF Trials.,/pubmed/29103847,"BACKGROUND: The PROTECT AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for EmbolicProtection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial demonstrated that leftatrial appendage closure (LAAC) with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, St. Paul, Minnesota) was equivalent to warfarin for preventing stroke in atrialfibrillation, but had a high rate of complications. In a second randomized trial,PREVAIL (Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With¾AtrialFibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy), the complication rate was low.The warfarin cohort experienced an unexpectedly low ischemic stroke rate,rendering the efficacy endpoints inconclusive. However, these outcomes were basedon relatively few patients followed for a relatively short time.OBJECTIVES: The final results of the PREVAIL trial, both alone and as part of apatient-level meta-analysis with the PROTECT AF trial, are reported with patientsin both trials followed for 5 years.METHODS: PREVAIL and PROTECT AF are prospective randomized clinical trials withpatients randomized 2:1 to LAAC or warfarin; together, they enrolled 1,114patients for 4,343 patient-years. Analyses are by intention-to-treat, and ratesare events per 100 patient-years.RESULTS: For the PREVAIL trial, the first composite coprimary endpoint of stroke,systemic embolism (SE), or cardiovascular/unexplained death did not achievenoninferiority (posterior probability for noninferiority¾=¾88.4%), whereas thesecond coprimary endpoint of post-procedure ischemic stroke/SE did achievenoninferiority (posterior probability for noninferiority¾=¾97.5%); the warfarinarm maintained an unusually low ischemic stroke rate (0.73%). In themeta-analysis, the composite endpoint was similar between groups (hazard ratio[HR]: 0.820; p¾=¾0.27), as were all-stroke/SE (HR: 0.961; p¾=¾0.87). The ischemicstroke/SE rate was numerically higher with LAAC, but this difference did notreach statistical significance (HR: 1.71; p¾=¾0.080). However, differences inhemorrhagic stroke, disabling/fatal stroke, cardiovascular/unexplained death,all-cause death, and post-procedure bleeding favored LAAC (HR: 0.20; p¾=¾0.0022; HR: 0.45; p¾=¾0.03; HR: 0.59; p¾=¾0.027; HR: 0.73; p¾=¾0.035; HR: 0.48;p¾=¾0.0003, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: These 5-year outcomes of the PREVAIL trial, combined with the 5-yearoutcomes of the PROTECT AF¾trial, demonstrate that LAAC with Watchman providesstroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation comparable to¾warfarin, withadditional reductions in major bleeding, particularly hemorrhagic stroke, andmortality.

Echocardiographic Risk Factors for Stroke and Outcomes in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulated With Apixaban or Warfarin.,/pubmed/29089455,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few data exist on the long-term outcomes of patients withspontaneous echo contrast (SEC), left atrial/left atrial appendage (LA/LAA)thrombus, and complex aortic plaque (CAP), in patients with atrial fibrillationreceiving oral anticoagulation. We explored the relationship between these 3echocardiographic findings and clinical outcomes, and the comparative efficacyand safety of apixaban and warfarin for each finding.METHODS: Patients from the ARISTOTLE trial (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) with SEC, LA/LAA thrombus, orCAP diagnosed by either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography werecompared with patients with none of these findings on transesophagealechocardiography.RESULTS: A total of 1251 patients were included: 217 had SEC, 127 had LA/LAAthrombus, 241 had CAP, and 746 had none. The rates of stroke/systemic embolismwere not significantly different among patients with and without theseechocardiographic findings (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval,0.25-3.60 for SEC; hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-6.86 forLA/LAA thrombus; hazard ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-6.85 for CAP).Rates of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, andall-cause death were also not different between patients with and without thesefindings. For patients with either SEC or CAP, there was no evidence of adifferential effect of apixaban over warfarin. For patients with LA/LAA thrombus,there was also no significant interaction, with the exception of all-cause death and any bleeding where there was a greater benefit of apixaban compared withwarfarin among patients with no LA/LAA thrombus.CONCLUSIONS: In anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation and risk factorsfor stroke, echocardiographic findings do not seem to add to the risk ofthromboembolic events.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Sex differences in AFepidemiology are insufficiently understood.METHODS: In N=79_793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age,49.6 years; age range, 24.1-97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-basedEuropean studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of theBiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe),we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common risk factors,biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.RESULTS: Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men(N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile atbaseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular diseasewas more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar(>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sexdifferences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio perstandard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.23 inwomen versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25-1.38 in men; interaction P value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater riskreduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.90 versus 0.92; 95%CI, 0.88-0.97 in men; interaction P value of 0.023). No sex differences were seenfor C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. Thepopulation-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was observed for body mass index.CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated withincreased mortality both in women and men.

Reconstruction left atrium and isolation pulmonary veins of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using single contact force catheter with zero x-ray exposure: A CONSORT Study.,/pubmed/29019873,"BACKGROUND: Conventional ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) isassociated with radiation risks for patients and laboratory staff.Three-dimensional (3D) mapping system capable of showing contact force (CF) anddirection of catheter tip may compensate for nonfluoroscopic safety issues.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of zero x-rayexposure during reconstruction left atrium (LA) and ablation.METHODS: Single, CF catheter, and 3D mapping system were used to reconstruct LAand isolate pulmonary veins (PV) in all patients. The patients were randomlydivided into 2 groups after LA angiography. In group 1, reconstruction LA andisolation PV was performed with the help of 3D system (without x-ray), whereas ingroup 2, x-ray and 3D system were utilized to reconstruct LA and ablate PVantrum. After ablation, Lasso catheter was used to confirm the PV isolation. All patients were followed up to 12 months.RESULTS: A total of 342 PAF patients were continuously enrolled. The basicclinical characteristics between the 2 groups had no significant difference.Parameters related to the procedure, average procedure time, ablation proceduretime, average contact force (CF) applied, the percentage of time within CFsettings, and average power applied during radiofrequency application showed nosignificant difference between the 2 groups. In group 1, the average fluoroscopy time before LA reconstruction was similar to that in group 2 (2.8_±_0.4 vs.2.4_±_0.6 minutes, P_=_.75). The average fluoroscopy time during ablation wassignificantly lower than that in group 2 (0 vs. 7.6_±_1.3 minutes, P_<_.001). Thetotal x-ray exposure dose of the procedure in group 1 was significantly lowerthan that in group 2 (19.6_±_9.4 vs. 128.7_±_62.5 mGy, respectively, P_<_.001).Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that there were no statistical differences in theprobability of freedom from atrial arrhythmia (AF/AFL/AT) recurrence at 12 monthsbetween group 1 and group 2 (P_=_.152). The success rate after a single ablation procedure and without drugs (Class I/III AAD) at 12 months was not significantly different between the 2 groups (67.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 62%-79.5% ingroup 1 and 68.9%, 95% CI: 63%-80.7% in group 2, P_=_.207). Procedural-relatedadverse events showed no significant different incidence between group 1 andgroup 2. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors wasperformed to evaluate the effectiveness outcome, which demonstrated that thepercentage of CF (within the investigator-selected work ranges) during therapywas significantly associated with positive outcomes (odds ratio: 3.68; 95% CI:1.65-10.6, P_=_.008), whereas the LA dimension was negatively associated witheffectiveness outcomes (odds ratio: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52-0.84, P_=_.016).CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction LA and isolation PV ablation using single CF-assistedcatheter without x-ray exposure was both safe and effective.

Randomised clinical trial of cryoballoon versus irrigated radio frequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation-the effect of double short versus standard exposure cryoablation duration during pulmonary vein isolation (CIRCA-DOSE): methods and rationa,/pubmed/28982836,"INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is an effective therapy forparoxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), but it has limitations. The two mostsignificant recent advances have centred on the integration of real-timequantitative assessment of catheter contact force into focal radio frequency (RF)ablation catheters and the development of dedicated ablation tools capable ofachieving PVI with a single ablation lesion (Arctic Front cryoballoon, Medtronic,Minneapolis, MN, USA). Although each of these holds promise for improving theclinical success of catheter ablation of AF, there has not been a rigorouscomparison of these advanced ablation technologies. Moreover, the optimalduration of cryoablation (freezing time) has not been determined.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients undergoing an initial PVI procedure for paroxysmalAF will be recruited. Patients will be randomised 1:1:1 between contact-forceirrigated RF ablation, short duration cryoballoon ablation (2_min applications)and standard duration cryoballoon ablation (4_min applications). The primaryoutcome is time to first documented AF recurrence on implantable loop recorder.With a sample size of 111 per group and a two-sided 0.025 significance level (to account for the two main comparisons), the study will have 80% power (using alog-rank test) to detect a difference of 20% between contact force RF catheterablation and either of the two cryoballoon ablation groups.

Effectiveness and Safety of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Asian Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28974629,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are limited real-world data comparing theeffectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in Asians with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety between NOACs and warfarin users in the Koreanatrial fibrillation population, with particular focus on high-risk patients.METHODS: Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we analyzedthe risk of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) events, and all-cause death in NOAC users (n=11_611 total, n=5681 taking rivaroxaban, n=3741 takingdabigatran, and n=2189 taking apixaban) compared with propensity score-matchedwarfarin users (n=23_222) among patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation(CHA2DS2-VASc score _2) between 2014 and 2015.RESULTS: NOAC treatment was associated with similar risk of ischemic stroke andlower risk of ICH and all-cause mortality compared with warfarin. All 3 NOACswere associated with a similar risk of ischemic stroke and a lower risk of ICHcompared with warfarin. Dabigatran and apixaban were associated with a lower riskof total mortality and the composite net clinical outcome (ischemic stroke, ICH, and all-cause death) compared with warfarin, whereas this was nonsignificant for rivaroxaban. Among previously oral anticoagulant-naive patients (n=23_262),dabigatran and apixaban were superior to warfarin for ICH prevention, whereasrivaroxaban and warfarin were associated with similar risk of ICH.CONCLUSIONS: In real-world practice among a high-risk Asian atrial fibrillationpopulation, all 3 NOACs demonstrated similar risk of ischemic stroke and lowerrisk of ICH compared with warfarin.

Systolic Blood Pressure Visit-to-Visit Variability and Major Adverse Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation: The AFFIRM Study (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management).,/pubmed/28974568,"Hypertension and atrial fibrillation predict major adverse events independently. Visit-to-visit variability (VVV) in systolic blood pressure (SBP) predictsoutcomes beyond SBP itself, but risk associated with SBP-VVV in atrialfibrillation remains uncertain. We evaluated relationships between SBP-VVV,quality of oral anticoagulation control, and outcomes in patients with atrialfibrillation. Data from the AFFIRM trial (atrial fibrillation follow-upinvestigation of rhythm management) were analyzed. SBP-VVV was defined according to SD of SBP (SBP-SD) during follow-up. SBP-VVV was categorized by quartiles(1st, <10.09; 2nd, 10.09-13.85; 3rd, 13.86-17.33; and 4th, _17.34 mm Hg) and as acontinuous variable. Among the original cohort, 3843 (94.7%) patients wereeligible. Time in therapeutic range and percentage of international normalizedratio in range were progressively lower by quartiles (both P<0.001). An inverselinear association existed between SBP-SD and time in therapeuticrange/percentage of international normalized ratio in range (P<0.001). After amedian (interquartile range) follow-up of 3.6 (2.7-4.6) years, stroke and majorbleeding rates progressively increased by SBP-VVV quartile (both P<0.001).Patients in the 4th quartile had the highest rate of cardiovascular and all-causedeath (P=0.005 and P<0.001). A Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that 3rd and4th quartiles were associated independently with a higher risk for stroke(P=0.042 and P=0.004) and major bleeding (P=0.009 and P<0.001). Patients in 4thquartile had also a higher risk for all-cause death (P=0.048). SBP-SD as acontinuous variable was associated with increased risk for all outcomes. Inconclusion, SBP-VVV is inversely associated with quality of anticoagulationcontrol and independently predicts major adverse outcomes.

We investigated the efficacy of the addition ofezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adversecardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: VytorinEfficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke beforerandomization.METHODS: Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to aplacebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of6 years. Treatment efficacy was assessed for the entire population and bysubgroups for the first and total (first and subsequent) events for the endpoints of stroke of any etiology, stroke subtypes, and the primary trial endpoint at 7 years.RESULTS: Of 18_144 patients, 641 (3.5%) experienced at least 1 stroke; most were ischemic (527, 82%). Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke,older age, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus,myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. There was a nonsignificantreduction in the first event of stroke of any etiology (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.00; P=0.052) withezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21%reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.94;P=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%;HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93-2.04; P=0.11).

Shared decision making for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28962662,"BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common ongoing healthproblem that places patients at risk of stroke. Whether and how a patientaddresses this risk depends on each patient's goals, context, and values.Consequently, leading cardiovascular societies recommend using shared decisionmaking (SDM) to individualize antithrombotic treatment in patients with AF. Theaim of this study is to assess the extent to which the ANTICOAGULATION CHOICEconversation tool promotes high-quality SDM and influences anticoagulation uptakeand adherence in patients with AF at risk of strokes.METHODS: This study protocol describes a multicenter, encounter-level, randomizedtrial to assess the effect of using the ANTICOAGULATION CHOICE conversation tool in the clinical encounter, compared to usual care. The participating centersinclude an academic hospital system, a suburban community group practice, and an urban safety net hospital, all in Minnesota, USA. Patients with ongoingnonvalvular AF at risk of strokes (CHA2DS2-VASc score___1 in men, or___2 inwomen) will be eligible for participation. We aim to include 999 patients andtheir clinicians. The primary outcome is the quality of SDM as perceived byparticipants, and as assessed by a post-encounter survey that ascertains (a)knowledge transfer, (b) concordance of the decision made, (c) quality ofcommunication, and (d) satisfaction with the decision-making process. Recordings of encounters will be reviewed to assess the extent of patient involvement andhow participants use the tool (fidelity). Anticoagulant use, choice of agent, andadherence will be drawn from patients' medical and pharmacy records. Strokes and bleeding events will be drawn from patient records.DISCUSSION: This study will provide a valid and precise measure of the effect of the ANTICOAGULATION CHOICE conversation tool on SDM quality and processes, and onthe treatment choices and adherence to therapy among AF patients at risk ofstroke.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02905032 .

Effect of ramadan fasting on acenocoumarol-induced antocoagulant effect.,/pubmed/28958959,"Eating patterns, food intake and type of alimentation vary greatly during themonth of ramadan. Furthermore, fasting, which practiced during the month oframadan, can have an impact on drug's metabolism. These two factors, fasting and eating habits changes during the month of ramadan, may impact acenocoumarolanticoagulant effect, translated by variations of INR values. The aim of ourstudy was to see ramadan fasting effects on INR variations in patients treated byacenocoumarol. A prospective monocentric study was conducted during the ramadanmonth on fasting outpatients that were treated by acenocoumarol. Baseline INRvalues (e.i. most recent available value before the month of ramadan) werecompared to INR values obtained during the month of ramadan. All patients weremonitored for signs of secondary haemorrhagic complications linked to treatmentby anti-vitamin K (AVK). Thirty patients were included in the study with a sexratio 1. Patients mean age was 65 years. Around two thirds of the patients weretreated by AVK for atrial fibrillation. The majority of patients (94%) have been treated by AVK for more than a year. Mean INR was significantly higher during themonth of ramadan than baseline (3.51 vs 2.52; p<¾0.0001). There were also moreoverdoses during the month of ramadan than baseline (9 vs. 0; p=0.014).

Association of sST2 and hs-CRP levels with new-onset atrial fibrillation in coronary artery disease.,/pubmed/28942872,"BACKGROUND: The data on biomarkers as predictors of atrial fibrillation (AF) inpatients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are limited.METHODS: A total of 1946 patients with CAD were recruited to the ARTEMIS study.At baseline, the study patients underwent clinical and echocardiographicexaminations and had laboratory tests. The patients (n=1710) with the informationabout the occurrence of new-onset AF during the follow-up were included in thepresent analysis.RESULTS: During 5.7±1.5years of follow-up, 143 (8.4%) patients developed anew-onset AF. Higher values of soluble ST2 (sST2) (20.2±10.8 vs. 17.5±7.2ng/mL,p=0.005), high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) (11.9±10.2 vs. 10.3±8.3ng/L,p=0.005), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (3.3±5.9 vs. 2.0±4.4mg/L, p<0.001) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (85.6±77.5 vs. 64.9±73.5ng/L,p<0.001) had significant associations with the occurrence of new-onset AF. In theCox clinical hazards model, higher age (p=0.004), greater weight (p=0.045),larger left atrial diameter (p=0.001), use of asthma/chronic obstructivepulmonary disease medication (p=0.001) and lack of cholesterol loweringmedication (p=0.008) had a significant association with the increased risk of AF.When the biomarkers were tested in the Cox clinical hazards model, sST2(HR=1.025, 95% CI=1.007-1.043, p=0.006) and hs-CRP (HR=1.027, 95% CI=1.008-1.047,p=0.006) retained their significant power in predicting AF.CONCLUSION: A biomarker of fibrosis, sST2, and a biomarker of inflammation,hs-CRP, predict the risk of occurrence of new-onset AF in patients with CAD.These biomarkers contributed to the discrimination of the AF risk model, but did not improve it markedly.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, ClinicalModification codes, we identified patients who underwent percutaneoustranscatheter PFO closure within 1 year of ischemic stroke or TIA. Our outcomewas an adverse event occurring during the hospitalization for PFO closure,defined as in prior studies as atrial fibrillation or flutter, cardiac tamponade,pneumothorax, hemothorax, a vascular access complication, or death. Crude rateswere reported with exact confidence intervals.RESULTS: We identified 1887 patients who underwent PFO closure after ischemicstroke or TIA. The rate of any adverse outcome during the hospitalization for PFOclosure was 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9%-8.2%).

Predicting Major Bleeding in Ischemic Stroke Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28931618,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Performance of risk scores for major bleeding in patientswith atrial fibrillation and a previous transient ischemic attack or ischemicstroke is not well established. We aimed to validate risk scores for majorbleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulantsafter cerebral ischemia and explore the net benefit of oral anticoagulants among bleeding risk categories.METHODS: We analyzed 3623 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack orstroke included in the RE-LY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-TermAnticoagulation Therapy). We assessed performance of HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic orrenal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older age, reduced platelet count orfunction, hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fallrisk, and stroke), Shireman, HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liverfunction, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile internationalnormalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), ATRIA (Anticoagulationand Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), and ORBIT scores (older age, reducedhaemoglobin/haematocrit/history of anaemia, bleeding history, insufficient kidneyfunction, and treatment with antiplatelet) with C statistics and calibrationplots. Net benefit of oral anticoagulants was explored by comparing riskreduction in ischemic stroke with risk increase in major bleedings on warfarin.RESULTS: During 6922 person-years of follow-up, 266 patients experienced a major bleed (3.8 per 100 person-years). C statistics ranged from 0.62 (Shireman) to0.67 (ATRIA). Calibration was poor for ATRIA and moderate for other models. Thereduction in recurrent ischemic strokes on warfarin was larger than the increase in major bleeding risk, irrespective of bleeding risk category.CONCLUSIONS: Performance of prediction models for major bleeding in patients withcerebral ischemia and atrial fibrillation is modest but comparable withperformance in patients with only atrial fibrillation. Bleeding risk scorescannot guide treatment decisions for oral anticoagulants but may still be useful to identify modifiable risk factors for bleeding. Clinical usefulness may be bestfor ORBIT, which is based on a limited number of easily obtainable variables and showed reasonable performance.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Integrated management of atrial fibrillation including tailoring of anticoagulation in primary care: study design of the ALL-IN cluster randomised trial.,/pubmed/28928175,"INTRODUCTION: In our ageing society, we are at the merge of an expected epidemic of atrial fibrillation (AF). AF management requires an integrated approach,including rate or rhythm control, stroke prevention with anticoagulation andtreatment of comorbidities such as heart failure or type 2 diabetes. As such,primary care seems to be the logical healthcare setting for the chronicmanagement of patients with AF. However, primary care has not yet played adominant role in AF management, which has been in fact more fragmented betweendifferent healthcare providers. This fragmentation might have contributed to highhealthcare costs. To demonstrate the feasibility of managing AF in primary care, studies are needed that evaluate the safety and (cost-)effectiveness ofintegrated AF management in primary care.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ALL-IN trial is a multicentre, pragmatic, clusterrandomised, non-inferiority trial performed in primary care practices in asuburban region in the Netherlands. We aim to include a minimum of 1000 patients with AF aged 65 years or more from around 18 to 30 practices. Duration of thestudy is 2_years. Practices will be randomised to either the intervention arm(providing integrated AF management, involving a trained practice nurse andcollaboration with secondary care) or the control arm (care as usual). Theprimary endpoint is all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints are cardiovascularmortality, (non)-cardiovascular hospitalisation, major adverse cardiac events,stroke, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, quality of lifeand cost-effectiveness.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the Medical EthicalCommittee of the Isala Hospital Zwolle, the Netherlands. Patients in theintervention arm will be asked informed consent for participating in theintervention.

The study willenroll 180 adults with non-valvular AF who are receiving anticoagulation forstroke prevention and randomize them to receive a 30-day intervention(smartphone-based ECA/Kardia) or standard of care, which will include a symptomand adherence journal. The primary end-points are improvement in HRQoL andself-reported adherence to anticoagulation. The secondary end-points are theacceptability of the intervention to participants, its use by participants, andacceptability to referring physicians.CONCLUSIONS: The AF-LITT pilot aims to evaluate the efficacy of the ECA/Kardia toimprove HRQoL and anticoagulant adherence, and to guide its implementation in alarger, multicenter clinical trial. The intervention has potential to improveHRQoL, adherence, and health care utilization in individuals with chronic AF.",Protocol,,Y,,smartphone-based ECA/Kardia,standard of care,,,Atrial Fibrillation,improvement in HRQoL ,
Self-detection of atrial fibrillation in an aged population: three-year follow-up of the LietoAF intervention study.,/pubmed/28915862,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic and undiagnosed until an ischaemic stroke occurs. An irregular pulse is a key manifestation of AF. Weassessed whether pulse self-palpation is feasible in screening of AF.METHODS: Altogether 205 residents of Lieto municipality aged _75¾years wererandomized in 2012 to receive brief education on pulse palpation focusing onevaluating rhythm regularity. Self-detected pulse irregularity and new AFdiagnoses were recorded, and the subjects' quality of life and use of health careservices were assessed during a three-year follow-up.RESULTS: The subjects' median age was 78.2 [3.8] years, and 89 (43.4%) were men. Overall, 139 (68%) subjects had initial good motivation/capability for regularpalpation. At four months, 112 (80.6%) subjects with good and 26 (39.4%) withinadequate motivation/capability palpated their pulse daily. At 12¾months, 120(58.5%) and at 36¾months, 69 (33.7%) subjects palpated their pulse at leastweekly. During the intervention, 67 (32.7%) subjects reported pulse irregularity.New AF was found in 10 (4.9%) subjects, 7 (70%) of whom had reported pulseirregularity. Pulse irregularity independently predicted new AF, but only one(0.5%) subject with new AF sought undelayed medical attention due to pulseirregularity. Quality of life and number of outpatient clinic visits remainedunchanged during follow-up.CONCLUSION: Pulse palpation can be learned also by the elderly, but it ischallenging to form a continuing habit. The low persistence of pulseself-palpation limits its value in the screening of AF, and strategies to promotepersistence and research on alternative screening methods are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01721005.

Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Anticoagulation vs. Antiplatelets after Stroke.,/pubmed/28902593,"BACKGROUND: Trials of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure to prevent recurrentstroke have been inconclusive. We investigated whether patients with cryptogenic stroke and echocardiographic features representing risk of stroke would benefitfrom PFO closure or anticoagulation, as compared with antiplatelet therapy.METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients 16 to 60 years of age who had had a recent stroke attributed toPFO, with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, totranscatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy (PFO closuregroup), antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group), or oralanticoagulation (anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1). Patients withcontraindications to anticoagulants or to PFO closure were randomly assigned tothe alternative noncontraindicated treatment or to antiplatelet therapy(randomization groups 2 and 3). The primary outcome was occurrence of stroke. Thecomparison of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy with antiplatelet therapyalone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 2, and thecomparison of oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 3.RESULTS: A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a mean (±SD) of 5.3±2.0 years. In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 2, no stroke occurred among the 238 patients in the PFO closure group, whereas strokeoccurred in 14 of the 235 patients in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.26; P<0.001). Procedural complications fromPFO closure occurred in 14 patients (5.9%). The rate of atrial fibrillation washigher in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (4.6% vs.0.9%, P=0.02). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (P=0.56). In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 3, stroke occurred in 3 of 187 patients assigned to oral anticoagulants andin 7 of 174 patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke attributed toPFO with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, therate of stroke recurrence was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapyalone.

Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Antiplatelet Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke.,/pubmed/28902580,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in theprevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. Weinvestigated the effect of PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone on the risks of recurrent stroke and new braininfarctions.METHODS: In this multinational trial involving patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, we randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to undergo PFOclosure plus antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group) or to receive antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group). Imaging of the brain was performed atthe baseline screening and at 24 months. The coprimary end points were freedomfrom clinical evidence of ischemic stroke (reported here as the percentage ofpatients who had a recurrence of stroke) through at least 24 months afterrandomization and the 24-month incidence of new brain infarction, which was acomposite of clinical ischemic stroke or silent brain infarction detected onimaging.RESULTS: We enrolled 664 patients (mean age, 45.2 years), of whom 81% hadmoderate or large interatrial shunts. During a median follow-up of 3.2 years,clinical ischemic stroke occurred in 6 of 441 patients (1.4%) in the PFO closure group and in 12 of 223 patients (5.4%) in the antiplatelet-only group (hazardratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.62; P=0.002). The incidence of new brain infarctions was significantly lower in the PFO closure group than inthe antiplatelet-only group (22 patients [5.7%] vs. 20 patients [11.3%]; relativerisk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.91; P=0.04), but the incidence of silent braininfarction did not differ significantly between the study groups (P=0.97).Serious adverse events occurred in 23.1% of the patients in the PFO closure groupand in 27.8% of the patients in the antiplatelet-only group (P=0.22). Seriousdevice-related adverse events occurred in 6 patients (1.4%) in the PFO closuregroup, and atrial fibrillation occurred in 29 patients (6.6%) after PFO closure.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, the riskof subsequent ischemic stroke was lower among those assigned to PFO closurecombined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelettherapy alone; however, PFO closure was associated with higher rates of devicecomplications and atrial fibrillation.

Rivaroxaban vs Warfarin Sodium in the Ultra-Early Period After Atrial Fibrillation-Related Mild Ischemic Stroke: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/28892526,"Importance: In atrial fibrillation (AF)-related acute ischemic stroke, theoptimal oral anticoagulation strategy remains unclear.Objective: To test whether rivaroxaban or warfarin sodium is safer and moreeffective for preventing early recurrent stroke in patients with AF-related acuteischemic stroke.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blindedend point evaluation, comparative phase 2 trial was conducted from April 28,2014, to December 7, 2015, at 14 academic medical centers in South Korea amongpatients with mild AF-related stroke within the previous 5 days who were deemedsuitable for early anticoagulation. Analysis was performed on a modifiedintent-to-treat basis.Interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive rivaroxaban, 10 mg/dfor 5 days followed by 15 or 20 mg/d, or warfarin with a target internationalnormalized ratio of 2.0-3.0, for 4 weeks.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the composite of newischemic lesion or new intracranial hemorrhage seen on results of magneticresonance imaging at 4 weeks. Primary analysis was performed in patients whoreceived at least 1 dose of study medications and completed follow-up magneticresonance imaging. Key secondary end points were individual components of theprimary end point and hospitalization length.Results: Of 195 patients randomized, 183 individuals (76 women and 107 men; mean [SD] age, 70.4 [10.4] years) completed magnetic resonance imaging follow-up andwere included in the primary end point analysis.

Outcome of Patients Receiving Thrombolytic Therapy While on Rivaroxaban for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (from Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atr,/pubmed/28886856,"The safety of intravenous thrombolysis in patients taking rivaroxaban has notbeen well established. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of all patientswho received thrombolytic therapy in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral DirectFactor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). A review of medical andadverse event records for patients receiving thrombolytic therapy while enrolled in ROCKET AF was performed to determine their baseline characteristics,indications for thrombolysis, and type of agent used. Safety end points were30-day post-thrombolytic rates of stroke, bleeding, and mortality. A total of 28 patients in ROCKET AF received thrombolytic therapy, with 19 patients onrivaroxaban and 9 patients on warfarin. Ischemic stroke was the most commonindication for thrombolysis (n_=_10), and alteplase was the most commonly usedfibrinolytic agent (n_=_14). Of the 19 patients in the rivaroxaban group, therewere 2 nonfatal bleeding events and 2 deaths, mostly occurring when thrombolytic therapy was administered within 48 hours of the last rivaroxaban dose. Of the 9patients in the warfarin group, there was 1 nonfatal bleeding event and 3 deaths,most occurring when thrombolytic therapy was administered outside of 48 hoursfrom the last warfarin dose. In conclusion, these observations suggest thatcareful assessment of the time since the last dose may be of clinicalsignificance in patients on novel oral anticoagulants who require emergentthrombolysis.",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Natriuretic Propeptides as Markers of Atrial Fibrillation Burden and Recurrence (from the AMIO-CAT Trial).,/pubmed/28865890,"Natriuretic peptides are established plasma markers of systolic heart failure,but their usefulness for the evaluation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown.We examined mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) andN-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients undergoingablation for AF. A subpopulation of 102 patients (median age 60 [52;65], 82%male) from the AMIO-CAT trial (Recurrence of arrhythmia following short-term oralAMIOdarone after CATheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: a double-blind,randomized, placebo-controlled study) undergoing ablation for paroxysmal (n_=_55)or persistent (n_=_47) AF was studied. MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were measuredbefore ablation and at 1, 3, and 6 months' follow-up. Three-day Holter monitoringwas performed before ablation, and 6 to 8 weeks and 6 months after ablation.Plasma MR-proANP and NT-proBNP concentrations were higher during AF than duringsinus rhythm before ablation (188_pmol/L [131;260] vs 94_pmol/L [64;125],p_<0.001; 78_pmol/L [43;121] vs 10.3_pmol/L [5.9;121], p_<0.001) and at 1, 3, and6 months' follow-up. Categories of AF burden on 3-day Holter monitoring (0%, 0%to 99%, and 99% to 100%) were associated with plasma concentrations of bothMR-proANP (94_pmol/L [55;127] vs 117_pmol/L [88;185] vs 192_pmol/L [127;261],p_<0.001) and NT-proBNP (10_pmol/L [5.9;22] vs 22_pmol/L [8.9;53] vs 81_pmol/L[45;116], p_<0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, however, there was nosignificant association between baseline propeptide concentrations and recurrenceof AF at 6 months' follow-up. In conclusion, AF was associated with higher plasmaconcentrations of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP than sinus rhythm. Moreover, AF burden was associated with subsequent concentrations of both MR-proANP and NT-proBNP.The results suggest that natriuretic propeptide measurement reflects functionalcardiac dysfunction during AF, and that AF burden should be included inbiochemical assessment of left ventricular dysfunction.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impact of Spontaneous Extracranial Bleeding Events on Health State Utility in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Trial.,/pubmed/28862934,"BACKGROUND: The impact of different types of extracranial bleeding events onhealth-related quality of life and health-state utility among patients withatrial fibrillation is not well understood.METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With FactorXa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction48) Trial compared edoxaban with warfarin with respect to the prevention ofstroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. Data from the EuroQol-5D(EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire, prospectively collected at 3-month intervals for up to 48¾months, were used to estimate the impact of different categories of bleedingevents on health-state utility over 12¾months following the event. Longitudinalmixed-effect models revealed that major gastrointestinal bleeds and majornongastrointestinal bleeds were associated with significant immediate decreasesin utility scores (-0.029 [-0.044 to -0.014; P<0.001] and -0.029 [-0.046 to-0.012; P=0.001], respectively). These effects decreased in magnitude over time, and were no longer significant for major nongastrointestinal bleeds at 9¾months, but remained borderline significant for major gastrointestinal bleeds at12¾months. Clinically relevant nonmajor and minor bleeds were associated withsmaller but measurable immediate impacts on utility (-0.010 [-0.016 to -0.005]and -0.016 [-0.024 to -0.008]; P<0.001 for both), which remained relativelyconstant and statistically significant over the 12 months following the bleeding event.CONCLUSIONS: All categories of bleeding events were associated with negativeimpacts on health-state utility in patients with atrial fibrillation. Majorbleeds were associated with relatively large immediate decreases in utilityscores that gradually diminished over 12¾months; clinically relevant nonmajor andminor bleeds were associated with smaller immediate decreases in utility thatpersisted over 12¾months.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.

Catheter Ablation Versus Medical Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation and Systolic Dysfunction: The CAMERA-MRI Study.,/pubmed/28855115,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction(LVSD) frequently co-exist despite adequate rate control. Existing randomizedstudies of AF and LVSD of varying etiologies have reported modest benefits with arhythm control strategy.OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether catheter ablation(CA) for AF could improve LVSD compared with medical rate control (MRC) where theetiology of the LVSD was unexplained, apart from the presence of AF.METHODS: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients withpersistent AF and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction[LVEF]¾_45%). After optimization of rate control, patients underwent cardiacmagnetic resonance (CMR) to assess LVEF and late gadolinium enhancement,indicative of ventricular fibrosis, before randomization to either CA or ongoing MRC. CA included pulmonary vein isolation and posterior wall isolation. AF burdenpost-CA was assessed by using an implanted loop recorder, and adequacy of MRC wasassessed by using serial Holter monitoring. The primary endpoint was change inLVEF on repeat CMR at 6¾months.RESULTS: A total of 301 patients were screened; 68 patients were enrolled betweenNovember 2013 and October 2016 and randomized with 33 in each arm (accounting for2 dropouts). The average AF burden post-CA was 1.6 ± 5.0% at 6¾months. In theintention-to-treat analysis, absolute LVEF improved by 18 ± 13% in the CA groupcompared with 4.4 ± 13% in the MRC group (p¾< 0.0001) and normalized (LVEF¾_50%) in 58% versus 9% (p¾=¾0.0002). In those undergoing CA, the absence of lategadolinium enhancement predicted greater improvements in absolute LVEF (10.7%;p¾=¾0.0069) and normalization at 6¾months (73% vs. 29%; p¾=¾0.0093).CONCLUSIONS: AF is an underappreciated reversible cause of LVSD in thispopulation despite adequate rate control. The restoration of sinus rhythm with CAresults in significant improvements in ventricular function, particularly in the absence of ventricular fibrosis on CMR. This outcome challenges the currenttreatment paradigm that rate control is the appropriate strategy in patients withAF and LVSD.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation: The REHEARSE-AF Study.,/pubmed/28851729,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in theaging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity andmortality.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using anAliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) inambulatory patients. Patients _65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score _2 freefrom AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participantsacquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic)onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithmand by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosisof AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECGinterpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate thecost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patientattitudes/experience were also evaluated.RESULTS: We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years ofage; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%;hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemicattack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenlydistributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosedwith AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9;95% confidence interval=1.4-10.4; P=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10_780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidenceinterval=0.22-1.69; P=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied withthe device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causinganxiety.CONCLUSIONS: Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remoteinterpretation in ambulatory patients _65 years of age at increased risk ofstroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group ofpatients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-drivenclinical trial.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.isrctn.com.

A device that might be suitable for prolonged ECG monitoring is asmartphone-compatible ECG device (Kardia Mobile, Alivecor, San Francisco, CA,USA) that allows the patient to record a single-lead ECG without the presence of trained health care staff. The MOBILE-AF trial will investigate the effectivenessof the ECG device for AF detection in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA. Inthis paper, the rationale and design of the MOBILE-AF trial is presented.METHODS: For this international, multicentre trial, 200 patients with cryptogenicstroke or TIA will be randomised. One hundred patients will receive the ECGdevice and will be asked to record their ECG twice daily during a period of1¾year. One hundred patients will receive a 7-day Holter monitor.DISCUSSION: The primary outcome of this study is the percentage of patients inwhich AF is detected in the first year after the index ischaemic stroke or TIA.Secondary outcomes include markers for AF prediction, orally administeredanticoagulation therapy changes, as well as the incidence of recurrent stroke andmajor bleeds.

Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran after PCI in Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28844193,"BACKGROUND: Triple antithrombotic therapy with warfarin plus two antiplateletagents is the standard of care after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) forpatients with atrial fibrillation, but this therapy is associated with a highrisk of bleeding.METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2725 patients withatrial fibrillation who had undergone PCI to triple therapy with warfarin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and aspirin (for 1 to 3 months)(triple-therapy group) or dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twicedaily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and no aspirin (110-mg and 150-mg dual-therapy groups). Outside the United States, elderly patients (_80years of age; _70 years of age in Japan) were randomly assigned to the 110-mgdual-therapy group or the triple-therapy group. The primary end point was a majoror clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event during follow-up (mean follow-up, 14 months). The trial also tested for the noninferiority of dual therapy withdabigatran (both doses combined) to triple therapy with warfarin with respect to the incidence of a composite efficacy end point of thromboembolic events(myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, or unplannedrevascularization.RESULTS: The incidence of the primary end point was 15.4% in the 110-mgdual-therapy group as compared with 26.9% in the triple-therapy group (hazardratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.63; P<0.001 fornoninferiority; P<0.001 for superiority) and 20.2% in the 150-mg dual-therapygroup as compared with 25.7% in the corresponding triple-therapy group, which didnot include elderly patients outside the United States (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The incidence of the compositeefficacy end point was 13.7% in the two dual-therapy groups combined as compared with 13.4% in the triple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.29;P=0.005 for noninferiority). The rate of serious adverse events did not differsignificantly among the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone PCI, therisk of bleeding was lower among those who received dual therapy with dabigatran and a P2Y12 inhibitor than among those who received triple therapy with warfarin,a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin. Dual therapy was noninferior to triple therapywith respect to the risk of thromboembolic events.

The primary safety endpoint was a composite of cardiacdeath, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. The primary efficacy endpointwas the incidence of clinically driven target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of 448 DCS and 431 BMS recipients were similar,78.8% had histories of atrial fibrillation, and 21% presented with acute coronarysyndromes. Four hundred patients in the DCS group and 376 in the BMS group weredischarged on OAC after percutaneous coronary intervention. At 2 years, for theDCS and BMS recipients, respectively, the incidence of clinically driven targetlesion revascularization was 7.5% versus 11.2% (hazard¾ratio: 0.63; 95%confidence interval: 0.40 to 1.01; p¾= 0.0514), the safety endpoint was reachedby 14.4% and 15.0% (p¾= NS), and the rates of major bleeding events (BleedingAcademic Research Consortium 3 to 5) were 10.7% and 12.9% (p¾= NS).CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy advantage of DCS over BMS up to 2 years appearsconfirmed in patients on long-term OAC.

Clinical data from 2prospectively collected datasets at our institution were reviewed: the CardiacSurgery Perioperative Outcomes Database and the Society of Thoracic SurgeonsDatabase. Preoperative _-blocker use was defined by Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines as patients receiving a _ blocker within 24 hours preceding surgery.Of the included patients, 2,648 (65.0%) were administered a _ blocker within 24hours before surgery. Adjusting for possible confounders, preoperative _-blocker use was associated with increased odds of AKI stage 2 (odds ratio 1.96, 95%confidence interval 1.19 to 3.24, p_<0.01). There was no evidence that _-blocker use had an independent association with postoperative delirium, AKI stages 1 and 3, stroke, AF, mortality, or prolonged length of stay.

We defined hyperuricemia as serum UA _7.0_mg/dL in menand _6_mg/dL in women. Patients were followed up for 6 months after discharge.The primary outcome was heart failure hospitalization or death. Among 173 HFrEFand 151 HFpEF cases, hyperuricemia was found in 43% and 57%, respectively(p_=_0.01).

Cardiovascular Event Prediction by Machine Learning: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.,/pubmed/28794054,"RATIONALE: Machine learning may be useful to characterize cardiovascular risk,predict outcomes, and identify biomarkers in population studies.OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of random survival forests, a machine learningtechnique, to predict 6 cardiovascular outcomes in comparison to standardcardiovascular risk scores.METHODS AND RESULTS: We included participants from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Studyof Atherosclerosis). Baseline measurements were used to predict cardiovascularoutcomes over 12 years of follow-up. MESA was designed to study progression ofsubclinical disease to cardiovascular events where participants were initiallyfree of cardiovascular disease. All 6814 participants from MESA, aged 45 to 84years, from 4 ethnicities, and 6 centers across the United States were included. Seven-hundred thirty-five variables from imaging and noninvasive tests,questionnaires, and biomarker panels were obtained. We used the random survivalforests technique to identify the top-20 predictors of each outcome. Imaging,electrocardiography, and serum biomarkers featured heavily on the top-20 lists asopposed to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Age was the most importantpredictor for all-cause mortality. Fasting glucose levels and carotidultrasonography measures were important predictors of stroke. Coronary ArteryCalcium score was the most important predictor of coronary heart disease and all atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease combined outcomes. Left ventricularstructure and function and cardiac troponin-T were among the top predictors forincident heart failure. Creatinine, age, and ankle-brachial index were among the top predictors of atrial fibrillation. TNF-_ (tissue necrosis factor-_) and IL(interleukin)-2 soluble receptors and NT-proBNP (N-Terminal Pro-B-TypeNatriuretic Peptide) levels were important across all outcomes. The randomsurvival forests technique performed better than established risk scores withincreased prediction accuracy (decreased Brier score by 10%-25%).CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning in conjunction with deep phenotyping improvesprediction accuracy in cardiovascular event prediction in an initiallyasymptomatic population. These methods may lead to greater insights onsubclinical disease markers without apriori assumptions of causality.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Patients with a leftventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and scheduled forisolated or combined coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled from June 2013 until May 2015 and followed during 6 months (lastfollow-up, November 30, 2015).Interventions: Patients were assigned to a 24-hour infusion of levosimendan 0.1µg/kg/min (n_=_167) or placebo (n_=_168) initiated after anesthetic induction.Main Outcomes and Measures: Composite end point reflecting low cardiac outputsyndrome with need for a catecholamine infusion 48 hours after study druginitiation, need for a left ventricular mechanical assist device or failure towean from it at 96 hours after study drug initiation when the device was insertedpreoperatively, or need for renal replacement therapy at any timepostoperatively. It was hypothesized that levosimendan would reduce the incidenceof this composite end point by 15% in comparison with placebo.Results: Among 336 randomized patients (mean age, 68 years; 16% women), 333completed the trial. The primary end point occurred in 87 patients (52%) in thelevosimendan group and 101 patients (61%) in the placebo group (absolute riskdifference taking into account center effect, -7% [95% CI, -17% to 3%]; P_=_.15).Predefined subgroup analyses found no interaction with ejection fraction lessthan 30%, type of surgery, and preoperative use of _-blockers, intra-aorticballoon pump, or catecholamines. The prevalence of hypotension (57% vs 48%),atrial fibrillation (50% vs 40%), and other adverse events did not significantly differ between levosimendan and placebo.Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with low ejection fraction who wereundergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass,levosimendan compared with placebo did not result in a significant difference in the composite end point of prolonged catecholamine infusion, use of leftventricular mechanical assist device, or renal replacement therapy.

Measuring the effect of nurse practitioner (NP)-led care on health-related quality of life in adult patients with atrial fibrillation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28774317,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia associated withsignificant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare resource use. The prevalence of AF is increasing with a growing and aging population, and timely access to carefor these patients is a concern. Nontraditional models of care delivery, such as nurse practitioner (NP)-led clinics, may improve access to care and quality ofcare, but they require formal assessment. The objective of this study is toassess the effect of NP-led care on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) ofadult patients with AF.METHODS/DESIGN: We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing NP-led care vs.standard care. Inclusion criteria are _18¾years of age, documented nonvalvularAF, willingness to give informed consent, and capacity to completequestionnaires. Patients referred for electrophysiological intervention who areclinically unstable or unable to attend follow-up visits will not be eligible to participate. Patients will be asked for verbal consent during the initial triage phone call from the nurse. Randomization will occur via a secure website. Theintervention includes an NP consult, including medical history, physicalexamination, patient teaching, treatment plan, and follow-up at 3 and 6¾months.The control arm involves usual cardiologist consultation with follow-updetermined by the cardiologist's practice pattern. The primary outcome will bethe difference in change in Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life Survey scores at 6¾months between groups. Secondary outcomes will include difference in change of EQ-5D scores at 6¾months between groups, difference in compositeoutcomes of death resulting from cardiovascular cause, hospitalizations andemergency department visits between groups, and satisfaction with NP-led caremeasured by the Consultant Satisfaction Questionnaire. A sample size of 70 pergroup will ensure adequate power despite a potential 10% loss to follow-up.DISCUSSION: Our study will determine the effect of NP-led AF care on HRQoL inpatients with AF, as well as measure its impact on relevant outcomes such asdeath, hospitalization, and emergency department visits.

Age and Sex Disparities in Discharge Statin Prescribing in the Stroke Belt: Evidence From the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study.,/pubmed/28768644,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a costly and debilitating disease that disproportionatelyaffects blacks. Despite the efficacy of statins, evidence suggests racialdisparities may exist in statin prescribing.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed discharge medications for participantshospitalized for an ischemic stroke during follow-up of the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study. Medications on admission and discharge were abstracted from medical records. Among the 666 eligible incidentstrokes (2003-2013), analyses were restricted to 323 participants who were notstatin users at the time of admission and had no history of atrial fibrillation. Overall, 48.7% were prescribed a statin on discharge. In the Stroke Belt,participants aged 65¾years and older were 47% less likely to be discharged on astatin compared with those younger than 65 years (relative risk [RR], 0.53; 95%CI, 0.38-0.74). This association was not observed in non-Stroke Belt residents.Outside the Stroke Belt, blacks were more likely than whites to be discharged on a statin (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.94), while no black:white association waspresent among Stroke Belt residents (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69-1.26; P forinteraction=0.228).

Growth-differentiation factor 15 and risk of major bleeding in atrial fibrillation: Insights from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial.,/pubmed/28760218,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and validate the prognostic value ofgrowth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) beyond clinical characteristics andother biomarkers concerning bleeding and stroke outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY trial.METHODS: GDF-15 was measured in samples collected at randomization in 8,474patients with a median follow-up time of 1.9 years. Patients were stratifiedbased on predefined GDF-15 cutoffs: group 1, <1,200 ng/L (the 90th percentile in healthy individuals); group 2, 1,200-1,800; and group 3, >1,800 ng/L (high-riskindividuals). Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared across groups of GDF-15 in Cox models adjusted for baseline characteristics, cardiac (N-terminalpro-b-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive troponin T), inflammatory(interleukin 6, C-reactive protein) and coagulation (D-dimer) biomarkers, andrandomized treatment.RESULTS: GDF-15 concentrations were <1,200 ng/L in 2,647 (31.2%), between 1,200and 1,800 ng/L in 2,704 (31.9%), and >1,800 ng/L in 3,123 (36.9%) participants,respectively. Annual rates of stroke, major bleeding, and mortality increasedwith higher GDF-15 levels. The prognostic value of GDF-15 was independent ofclinical characteristics for these outcomes. In models also adjusted forbiomarkers, GDF-15 remained significantly associated with major bleeding (hazard ratio [95% CI] group 3 vs group 1 1.76 [1.28-2.42], P < .0005) and all-causemortality (hazard ratio 1.72 [1.30-2.29], P < .0005). GDF-15 improved the c indexof both the HAS-BLED (0.62-0.69) and ORBIT (0.68-0.71) bleeding risk scores.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation, GDF-15 is an independent risk indicator for major bleeding and all-cause mortality, but not for stroke.Therefore, GDF-15 seems useful as a specific marker of bleeding in patients with AF on oral anticoagulant treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Stroke of Known Cause and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation (STROKE-AF) randomized trial: Design and rationale.,/pubmed/28760209,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of ischemic strokes are associated with clinically apparent atrial fibrillation (AF). Regardless of stroke etiology, detection of AFin patients with ischemic strokes often changes antithrombotic treatment fromanti-platelet to oral anticoagulation therapy. The role and the optimum duration of cardiac monitoring to detect AF in patients with strokes presumed due to largevessel atherosclerosis or small vessel disease is unknown. This manuscriptdescribes the design and rationale of the STROKE-AF trial.STUDY DESIGN: STROKE-AF is a randomized, controlled, open-label, post-marketclinical trial. Detection of AF will be evaluated using continuous arrhythmiamonitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) compared with standard ofcare follow-up in patients with stroke (within the prior 10 days) that ispresumed due to large vessel cervical or intracranial atherosclerosis, or tosmall vessel disease.

Probing oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial high rate episodes: Rationale and design of the Non-vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes (NOAH-AFNET 6) trial.,/pubmed/28760205,"Oral anticoagulation prevents ischemic strokes in patients with atrialfibrillation (AF). Early detection of AF and subsequent initiation of oralanticoagulation help to prevent strokes in AF patients. Implanted cardiacpacemakers and defibrillators allow seamless detection of atrial high rateepisodes (AHRE), but the best antithrombotic therapy in patients with AHRE is notknown.RATIONALE: Stroke risk is higher in pacemaker patients with AHRE than inthose without, but the available data also show that stroke risk in patients withAHRE is lower than in patients with AF. Furthermore, only a minority of patients with AHRE will develop AF, many strokes occur without a temporal relation toAHRE, and AHRE can reflect other arrhythmias than AF or artifacts. An adequately powered controlled trial of oral anticoagulation in patients with AHRE is needed.DESIGN: The Non-vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes (NOAH-AFNET 6 ) trial tests whether oral anticoagulation with edoxaban is superior to prevent the primary efficacy outcome of stroke orcardiovascular death compared with aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy based on evidence-based indications.

The Impact of Cryoballoon Versus Radiofrequency Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation on Healthcare Utilization and Costs: An Economic Analysis From the FIRE AND ICE Trial.,/pubmed/28751544,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to assess payer costs following cryoballoon orradiofrequency current (RFC) catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the randomized FIRE AND ICE trial.METHODS AND RESULTS: A trial period analysis of healthcare costs evaluated theimpact of ablation modality (cryoballoon versus RFC) on differences in resourceuse and associated payer costs. Analyses were based on repeat interventions,rehospitalizations, and cardioversions during the trial, with unit costs based on3 national healthcare systems (Germany [], the United Kingdom [£], and theUnited States [$]). Total payer costs were calculated by applying standard unitcosts to hospital stays, using International Classification of Diseases, 10thRevision diagnoses and procedure codes that were mapped to country-specificdiagnosis-related groups. Patients (N=750) randomized 1:1 to cryoballoon (n=374) or RFC (n=376) ablation were followed for a mean of 1.5¾years. Resource use waslower in the cryoballoon than the RFC group (205 hospitalizations and/orinterventions in 122 patients versus 268 events in 154 patients). The costdifferences per patient in mean total payer costs during follow-up were 640,£364, and $925 in favor of cryoballoon ablation (P=0.012, 0.013, and 0.016,respectively). This resulted in trial period total cost savings of 245¾000,£140¾000, and $355¾000.CONCLUSIONS: When compared with RFC ablation, cryoballoon ablation was associatedwith a reduction in resource use and payer costs. In all 3 national healthcaresystems analyzed, this reduction resulted in substantial trial period costsavings, primarily attributable to fewer repeat ablations and a reduction incardiovascular rehospitalizations with cryoballoon ablation.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Adverse events included 117 cardiac perforations (0.281%), 5cerebrovascular accidents (0.012%), 10 AE fistulas (0.024%), 53 audible steampops (0.127%), and 13 deaths (0.031%). The total event rate in European countrieswas 0.53% vs 0.38% in the United States (P = .0082). The AE fistula event ratepeaked in late 2014 and early 2015 at 0.06% and decreased over time to asteady-state 0.01%, corresponding to the initial US release, subsequent increaseduse, and training on the manufacturer recommended settings.CONCLUSION: Complication rates while using the TactiCath CF ablation catheterappear to decrease with training and experience.

"A review of rate control in atrial fibrillation, and the rationale and protocol for the RATE-AF trial.",/pubmed/28729311,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and causes impaired quality of life, an increased risk of stroke and death as well as frequenthospital admissions. The majority of patients with AF require control of heartrate. In this article , we summarise the limited evidence from clinical trialsthat guides prescription, and present the rationale and protocol for a newrandomised trial. As rate control has not yet been shown to reduce mortality,there is a clear need to compare the impact of therapy on quality of life,cardiac function and exercise capacity. Such a trial should concentrate on thelong-term effects of treatment in the largest proportion of patients with AF,those with symptomatic permanent AF, with the aim of improving patientwell-being.DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: The RAte control Therapy Evaluation in permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) trial will enrol 160 participants with a prospective,randomised, open-label, blinded end point design comparing initial rate controlwith digoxin or bisoprolol. This will be the first head-to-head randomised trial of digoxin and beta-blockers in AF.PARTICIPANTS: Recruited patients will be aged ¢Î_ÎÇ60 years with permanent AFand symptoms of breathlessness (equivalent to New York Heart Association class IIor above), with few exclusion criteria to maximise generalisability to routineclinical practice.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is patient-reported quality of life, withsecondary outcomes including echocardiographic ventricular function, exercisecapacity and biomarkers of cellular and clinical response. Follow-up will occurat 6 and 12 months, with feasibility components to inform the design of a future trial powered to detect a difference in hospital admission. The RATE-AF trialwill underpin an integrated approach to management including biomarkers,functions and symptoms that will guide future research into optimal, personalisedrate control in patients with AF.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: East Midlands-Derby Research Ethics Committee(16/EM/0178); peer-reviewed publications.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02391337; ISRCTN: 95259705.Pre-results.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anticoagulation Control in Warfarin-Treated Patients Undergoing Cardioversion of Atrial Fibrillation (from the Edoxaban Versus Enoxaparin-Warfarin in Patients Undergoing Cardioversion of Atrial Fibrillation Trial).,/pubmed/28709650,"In the Edoxaban Versus Enoxaparin-Warfarin in Patients Undergoing Cardioversionof Atrial Fibrillation (ENSURE-AF) study (NCT 02072434), edoxaban was comparedwith enoxaparin-warfarin in 2,199 patients undergoing electrical cardioversion ofnonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). In this multicenter prospective randomized open blinded end-point trial, we analyzed patients randomized toenoxaparin-warfarin.

Stand-Alone Pulmonary Vein Isolation Versus Pulmonary Vein Isolation With Additional Substrate Modification as Index Ablation Procedures in Patients With Persistent and Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: The Randomized Alster-Lost-AF Trial (Abl,/pubmed/28687670,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for persistent atrial fibrillation is associated with limited success rates and often requires multiple procedures tomaintain stable sinus rhythm. In the prospective and randomized Alster-Lost-AFtrial (Ablation at St. Georg Hospital for Long-Standing Persistent AtrialFibrillation), we sought to assess, in patients with symptomatic persistent orlong-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, the outcomes of initial ablativestrategies comprising either stand-alone PVI (PVI-only approach) or a stepwiseapproach of PVI followed by complex fractionated atrial electrogram ablation and linear ablation (Substrate-modification approach).METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to stand-alone PVI or PVI plus substrate modification. The primary study end point was freedom from recurrenceof any atrial tachyarrhythmia, outside a 90-day blanking period, at 12 months. A total of 124 patients were enrolled, with 118 patients included in the analysis(61 in the PVI-only group, 57 in the Substrate-modification group). Atrialtachyarrhythmias recurred in 28 PVI-only group patients and 24Substrate-modification group patients, for 1-year freedom from tachyarrhythmiarecurrence after a single ablation procedure of 54% (95% confidence interval,43%-68%) in the PVI-only and 57% (95% confidence interval, 46%-72%) in theSubstrate-modification group (P=0.86). Twenty-four patients in the PVI-only group(39%) and 18 in the Substrate-modification group (32%) were without arrhythmiarecurrence and off antiarrhythmic drug therapy at the end of the 12-monthfollow-up.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent and long-standing persistent atrialfibrillation, no significant difference was observed in 12-month freedom fromatrial tachyarrhythmias between an index ablative approach of stand-alone PVI anda stepwise approach of PVI plus complex fractionated atrial electrogram andlinear ablation.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Influence of decision aids on oral anticoagulant prescribing among physicians: a randomised trial.,/pubmed/28682461,"BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) are underused in treatment of atrialfibrillation (AF), with differences in patient and physician preferences. Forrisk communication, the graphic showing risks on treatment contains all theinformation, therefore, the graphic showing risks without treatment may not benecessary. Here, our objective was to assess whether decision aids requireinformation of risks without treatment and specifically whether presentation of5-year stroke risk in patients with AF increases use of OACs compared withpresentation of 1-year risk and whether decisions on treatment are different whenphysicians decide their own treatment vs. that of the patient.DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with 23 factorial design, performed at 12university hospitals, one internal medicine course and one national medicalconference.RESULTS: Of 968 physicians who participated, 83à3% prescribed anticoagulationtherapy. Treatment decisions were not influenced by the number of graphics or by the time frame of risk estimation, with risk differences of 0à5% (95% confidence interval, -4à0% to 5à4%) and 3à4% (-1à3% to 8à1%). However, physician-to-patient prescription rates were 5à4% (0à2-10à6%) more frequent after seeing the 5-yearrisk graphic. Physician-to-self intentions to prescribe occurred less frequently,with risk difference of 15à4% (10à8-20%). Physicians considered the baseline riskand the absolute risk reduction only when prescribing to patients but not tothemselves.CONCLUSIONS: Risks could be communicated using decision aids with only onegraphic.

Digoxin Use and Subsequent Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation With or Without Heart Failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Trial.,/pubmed/28666993,"BACKGROUND: Digoxin is widely used in patients with atrial fibrillation despitethe lack of randomized controlled trials. Observational studies reportconflicting results regarding its association with mortality, perhaps because of residual confounding by the presence of heart failure (HF).METHODS AND RESULTS: In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation WithFactor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in MyocardialInfarction 48) trial, clinical outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation withand without HF were examined by baseline digoxin use during a median follow-up of2.8¾years. HF was defined at baseline as prior or current clinical stage C or DHF. Of 21¾105 patients enrolled, 6327 (30%) were treated with digoxin atbaseline. Among patients without HF (n=8981), digoxin use (20%) was independentlyassociated with sudden cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI,1.10-2.08), with no significant interaction by age, sex, left ventricularejection fraction, renal function, or concomitant medications (P>0.05 for each). Consistent results were observed using propensity matching (adjusted hazard ratiofor sudden cardiac death, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.36-2.65). Among patients with HF(n=12¾124), digoxin use (37%) was associated with an increase in all-cause death,cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death, and death caused by HF/cardiogenicshock (P<0.01 for each), but not with noncardiovascular death, stroke/systemicembolism, or myocardial infarction.CONCLUSIONS: In this observational analysis of patients with atrial fibrillation without investigator-reported HF, digoxin use was significantly associated withsudden cardiac death. While residual confounding cannot be excluded, theassociation between digoxin use and worse clinical outcomes highlights the needto examine digoxin use, particularly when prescribed to control heart rate inpatients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized trial.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Gene Expression Profiles for the Identification of Prevalent Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28666990,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) can be difficult, requiringcumbersome investigations. We aimed to determine the association of establishedwhole-blood gene expression scores with prevalent AF and to evaluate theirperformance for the identification of AF in a SIRS (Steroids in Cardiac Surgery) trial cohort.METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-blood, transcriptome-wide gene expression profilingwas performed using the Illumina HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChip in 416participants (65% men) before surgery, including 91 with a diagnosis of AF. An AFgene score (GS) calculated from 7 genes reported to be upregulated in AF and avalidated GS for biological age based on 1254 genes related to aging were bothindependently associated with AF diagnosis before surgery in multivariatelogistic regression analyses adjusting for known risk factors (P=0.0006 andP=0.003). Addition of AF and biological age GSs to clinical risk factors led tosignificant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(from 0.77 to 0.80; P=0.03), continuous net reclassification improvement index(P<0.0001), and integrated discrimination improvement index (P=0.0002). Whenstratifying AF by subtype, AF GS was mainly associated with paroxysmal AF(P=0.003), whereas the biological age GS was mainly associated with permanent AF (P=0.017).CONCLUSIONS: We validated the existence of a blood gene expression signature for prevalent AF and showed that biological age derived from gene expression issignificantly associated with prevalent AF. These findings suggest a potentialutility of blood gene expression for the identification of patients with AF,particularly paroxysmal AF. This result could have implications for theprevention and management of cryptogenic stroke.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Repeated Measurements of Cardiac Biomarkers in Atrial Fibrillation and Validation of the ABC Stroke Score Over Time.,/pubmed/28645934,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac biomarkers are independent risk markers in atrialfibrillation, and the novel biomarker-based ABC stroke score (age, biomarkers,and clinical history of prior stroke) was recently shown to improve theprediction of stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our aim was toinvestigate the short-term variability of the cardiac biomarkers and evaluatewhether the ABC stroke risk score provides a stable short-term risk estimate.METHODS AND RESULTS: According to the study protocol, samples were obtained atentry and also at 2¾months in 4796 patients with atrial fibrillation followed fora median of 1.8¾years in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke andOther Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Cardiac troponin I,cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were measuredwith high-sensitivity immunoassays. Associations with outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression. C¾indices and calibration plots were used to evaluate the ABCstroke score at 2¾months. The average changes in biomarker levels during 2¾monthswere small (median change cardiac troponin T +2.8%, troponin I +2.0%, andN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide +13.5%) and within-subject correlation was high (all _0.82). Repeated measurement of cardiac biomarkers provided someincremental prognostic value for mortality but not for stroke when combined with clinical risk factors and baseline levels of the biomarkers. Based on 8702person-years of follow-up and 96 stroke/systemic embolic events, the ABC strokescore at 2¾months achieved a similar C index of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65-0.76) ascompared with 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65-0.75) at baseline. The ABC stroke score remainedwell calibrated using predefined risk classes.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable atrial fibrillation, the variability of the cardiac biomarkers and the biomarker-based ABC stroke score during 2¾months aresmall. The prognostic information by the ABC stroke score remains consistent and well calibrated with similar good predictive performance if patients are retestedafter 2¾months.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Elimination of the negative component of the unipolar electrogram as a local procedural endpoint during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation catheter ablation using contact-force sensing: the UNIFORCE study.,/pubmed/28643171,"PURPOSE: Elimination of the negative component of the unipolar atrial electrogramis a reliable indicator of the creation of a transmural lesion. Contact-force(CF) sensing technology has the potential to increase the durability of pulmonaryvein isolation (PVI). In the present multicenter study, we assessed the 2-yearsinus rhythm (SR) maintenance rate in patients with paroxysmal atrialfibrillation (PAF) after PVI guided by these two approaches.METHODS: Two hundred fifteen consecutive PAF patients (62.1¾±¾10.1¾years, 65women) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent PVI under CARTOguidance according to a systematic contiguous ""point-by-point"" approach, usingradiofrequency energy, and a CF externally irrigated ablation catheter with thegoal of at least 10g (ideally 20g) of force. The ablation endpoint of eachindividual lesion was elimination of the negative component of the unipolaratrial signal. The procedural endpoint was PVI with bidirectional block.RESULTS: All PVs were successfully isolated. After 30¾min of waiting time, 35patients (16%) had PV reconnection and in all of them, the PVs were re-isolated. Two years after a single ablation procedure, 187 patients (87%) remainedarrhythmia free, without anti-arrhythmic drugs.

Rationale and Design for a Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety between Aspirin and Clopidogrel in Atrial Fibrillation Patients with Low Stroke Risk: CESAC-AF trial.,/pubmed/28642210,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic stroke.An oral anticoagulant should be administrated to prevent stroke in patients with moderate stroke risk (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc score>2). If the stroke risk is low (i.e. the score=1), however, antiplatelet agent such as aspirin is widely used. Aspirincan cause peptic ulcer disease (PUD) while its alternative, clopidogrel,theoretically does not.OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the efficacy and safety between aspirin and clopidogrel, a multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed in AF patients with lowstroke risk.METHODS: According to sample size estimation based on previous literature, atotal of 1560 AF patients with low stroke risk will be randomly assigned into 4different groups dependent upon initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) results:two mono-antiplatelet treatment groups with either aspirin 100mg or clopidogrel75mg for 1year; two antiplatelet agent and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)combination groups. Follow-up EGD will be performed at 1year.RESULTS: The clinical follow-up will be performed for 1year after enrollment. Theprimary efficacy endpoint is to compare the annual stroke rate between aspirinand clopidogrel treatment groups. The primary safety endpoint is to compare theprevalence of drug-induced gastrointestinal (GI) and intracranial hemorrhage and upper-GI response including PUD based on EGD after 1year.CONCLUSIONS: This trial will determine whether clopidogrel is noninferior instroke prevention and superior in reduction of GI events including PUD to aspirinin AF patients with low stroke risk.

Modifiable Risk Factors for Incident Heart_Failure in Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28624486,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify modifiable risk factors and estimatethe impact of risk factor modification on heart failure (HF) risk in women withnew-onset atrial fibrillation (AF).BACKGROUND: Incident HF is the most common nonfatal event in patients with AF,although strategies for HF prevention are lacking.METHODS: We assessed 34,736 participants in the Women's Health Study who werefree of prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox models withtime-varying assessment of risk factors after AF diagnosis were used to identify significant modifiable risk factors for incident HF.RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 20.6 years, 1,495 women developed AF without prevalent HF. In multivariable models, new-onset AF was associated with anincreased risk of HF (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.52to 10.85). Once women with AF developed HF, all-cause (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.45) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.70 to 4.85) increased. Intime-updated, multivariable models accounting for changes in risk factors afterAF diagnosis, systolic blood pressure >120 mm¾Hg, body mass index¾_30 kg/m2,current tobacco use, and diabetes mellitus were each associated with incident HF.The combination of these 4 modifiable risk factors accounted for an estimated 62%(95% CI: 23% to 83%) of the population-attributable risk of HF. Compared withwomen with 3 or 4 risk factors, those who maintained or achieved optimal riskfactor control had a progressive decreased risk¾of¾HF (HR for 2 risk factors:0.60; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95; 1 risk factor: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.63; and 0 riskfactors: 0.14;¾95% CI: 0.07 to 0.29).CONCLUSIONS: In women with new-onset AF, modifiable risk factors includingobesity, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes accounted for the majority of thepopulation risk of HF. Optimal levels of modifiable risk factors were associated with decreased HF risk. Prospective assessment of risk factor modification at thetime of AF diagnosis may warrant future investigation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamics Modeling of Ibutilide in Chinese Healthy Volunteers and Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and/or Atrial Flutter (AFL).,/pubmed/28624123,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) model for ibutilide, to evaluate the time course of its effect on QT interval in Chinese.METHODS: The population PK and PK/PD model were developed using data from 40Chinese healthy volunteers using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, and the final population PK/PD model was applied on 100 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or atrial flutter (AFL).FINDINGS: The PK parameters of ibutilide were best described by a 3-compartmentmodel with first-order elimination. No statistically significant covariate wasfound for each PK model parameter. Individualized QT interval correction, byheart rate, was performed by a power model, and the circadian rhythm of QTintervals was described by 2 mixed-effect cosine functions. The QT interval data of ibutilide was well characterized by a sigmoid Emax model(E(C)=Emax__C_/(EC50_+C_)) with an effect compartment. The final PK/PD model was used to estimate individual parameters of patient data and found good predictionscompared with healthy volunteers; AF and/or AFL patients had lower Emax andhigher EC50.IMPLICATIONS: A population PK and PK/PD model for ibutilide in healthy volunteerswas developed and could well capture ibutilide's PK/PD characteristics.

Administration of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.,/pubmed/28623609,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved to treat and preventthrombotic events. However, they are not yet labeled for use in patients withactive cancers. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal chronic disorders with a high incidence of thrombotic events, for which low-dose aspirin (LDA) isthe standard drug treatment. We analyzed efficacy and safety of DOACsprescription in patients treated for MPNs. An MPN database, the OBENE registry,was established at our institution. We collected biological and clinical datafrom diagnosis to last follow-up for every patient included in this study.Thrombotic and hemorrhagic events and hematologic evolutions were categorized as major events in the database. Of the 760 MPN patients in the OBENE registry, 25(3.3%) were treated with a DOAC. Median follow-up duration was 2.1¾years(0.12-4.3¾years). The reasons for prescribing DOACs were atrial fibrillation and thrombotic events for 13 and 12 patients, respectively. We only observed onethrombotic event (4%) and three major hemorrhagic events (12%). A case-controlstudy did not detect a significant difference in thrombotic or hemorrhagic eventsin patients treated with LDA and DOACs.

Safety and Efficacy of Rivaroxaban in Patients With Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices: Observations From the ROCKET AF Trial.,/pubmed/28615214,"BACKGROUND: Although implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices(CIEDs) in patients receiving warfarin is well studied, limited data areavailable on the use of oral factor Xa inhibitors in this setting.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor XaInhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke andEmbolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) (n=14¾264), we comparedbaseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with atrialfibrillation randomized to rivaroxaban versus warfarin who did and did notundergo CIED implantation or revision. In this post-hoc, postrandomization,on-treatment analysis, only the first intervention per patient was analyzed.During a median follow-up of 2.2¾years, 453 patients (242 rivaroxaban group; 211 warfarin group) underwent de novo CIED implantation (64.2%) or revisionprocedures (35.8%). Patients who received CIEDs were older, more likely to bemale, and more likely to have past myocardial infarction, but had similar stroke risk compared to patients who did not receive CIEDs. Most patients who received adevice had study drug interrupted for the procedure and did not receive bridging anticoagulation. During the 30-day postprocedural period, 11 patients (4.55%) in the rivaroxaban group experienced bleeding complications compared with 15 (7.13%)in the warfarin group. Thromboembolic complications occurred in 3 patients(1.26%) in the rivaroxaban group and 1 (0.48%) in the warfarin group. Event rateswere too low for formal hypothesis testing.CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding and thromboembolic events were low in both rivaroxaban- andwarfarin-treated patients.

"Pulmonary Vein Isolation Alone Versus Additional Linear Ablation in Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Converted to Paroxysmal Type With Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy: A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Study.",/pubmed/28611206,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) type can vary depending on condition andtiming, and some patients who initially present with persistent AF may be changedto paroxysmal AF after antiarrhythmic drug medication and cardioversion. Weinvestigated whether circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) alone is an effective rhythm control strategy in patients with persistent AF to paroxysmalAF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 113 patients with persistent AF to paroxysmal AF(male 75%, 60.4±10.1 years old) who underwent catheter ablation for nonvalvularAF at 3 tertiary hospitals. The participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups: CPVI alone (n=59) or CPVI plus linear ablation (CPVI+Line; posterior box+anteriorline, n=54). Compared with the CPVI+Line, CPVI alone required shorter procedure(187.2±58.0 versus 211.2±63.9 min; P=0.043) and ablation times (4922.1±1110.5versus 6205.7±1425.2 s; P<0.001) without difference in procedure-related majorcomplication (3% versus 2%; P=0.611). Antiarrhythmic drug utility rates afterablation were not different between the 2 groups (22% versus 30%; P=0.356).Overall, AF-free survival (log-rank; P=0.206) and AF and antiarrhythmic drug-freesurvival (log-rank; P=0.321) were not different between groups.CONCLUSIONS: CPVI alone is an effective rhythm control strategy with a shorterprocedure time in persistent AF patients converted to paroxysmal AF compared withCPVI with linear ablation.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Safety and Efficacy of Uninterrupted Apixaban Therapy Versus Warfarin During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.,/pubmed/28595862,"Thromboembolic cerebrovascular accident remains a rare but potentiallydevastating complication of catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation.Uninterrupted oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has become the standard ofcare when performing catheter-based AF ablation. Compared with warfarin,apixaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major bleeding in nonvalvular AF. With an increase in apixaban use for strokeprophylaxis in patients with AF, there is an increased interest in the safety andefficacy of uninterrupted apixaban therapy during AF ablation. We compared thesafety and efficacy of uninterrupted OA therapy with either warfarin or apixaban in all patients who underwent catheter-based AF ablation at the University ofAlabama at Birmingham and at Augusta University Medical Center from January 7,2013, to February 25, 2016. All patients underwent a transesophagealechocardiogram on the day of their ablation to assess for the presence ofintracardiac thrombi. All complications were identified and classified asbleeding, thromboembolic events, or other. A total of 627 patients were analyzed as described earlier. There were 310 patients in the warfarin group and 317patients in the apixaban group. There were 8 complications in the warfarin group and 5 complications in the apixaban group (p¾= 0.38). There were nothromboembolic complications in either group.

Design and rationale for the WARFA trial: a randomized controlled cross-over trial testing the therapeutic equivalence of branded and generic warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients in Brazil.,/pubmed/28592234,"BACKGROUND: Warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant. Whether a given dose ofthe different formulations of Brazilian warfarin will result in the same effecton the international normalized ratio (INR) is uncertain. The aim of the WARFAtrial is to determine whether the branded and two generic warfarins available in Brazil differ in their effect on the INR.METHODS: WARFA is a cross-over RCT comparing three warfarins. The formulationstested are the branded MarevanÂ (Uniao Quimica/Farmoquimica) and two genericwarfarin (manufactured respectively by Uniao Quimica Farmaceutica Nacional andLaboratorio Teuto Brasileiro). All of them were manufactured in Brazil, areavailable in all settings of the Brazilian healthcare system and were purchasedfrom retail drugstores. Eligible participants had atrial fibrillation or flutter,had been using warfarin for at least 2¾months with a therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0and had low variability in INR results during the 1st period¾of the trial. Ourprimary outcome, for which we have an equality hypothesis, is the differencebetween warfarins in the mean absolute difference between two INR¾results,obtained after three and 4 weeks with each drug. Our secondary outcomes, thatwill be tested for inequality (except for the mean INR, which will be tested for equality), include the difference in the warfarin dose, and time in therapeuticrange. Clinical events and adherence were also recorded and will be reported.DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, WARFA will be the first comparison of the morereadily applicable INR results between branded and generic warfarins in Brazil.WARFA is important because warfarins are commonly switched between in the course of a chronic treatment in Brazil. Final results of WARFA are expected in May2017.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02017197 .

Totally Implantable IV Treprostinil Therapy_in Pulmonary Hypertension Assessment of the Implantation Procedure.,/pubmed/28583617,"BACKGROUND: Prostacyclins improve symptoms and survival in pulmonary arterialhypertension (PAH). In response to risks associated with external deliverysystems, an implantable IV infusion system was developed. A multicenter,prospective, single-arm, clinical trial (DelIVery for PAH) was conducted toevaluate this system for treprostinil in PAH. This analysis describes thefindings related to the implant procedure.METHODS: Patients (N¾= 64) with PAH (World Health Organization group 1) receivingstable IV treprostinil were enrolled. Patients were transitioned to a temporaryperipheral IV infusion catheter prior to the procedure. System implantation wasperformed at 10 centers under general anesthesia or deep IV sedation byclinicians from various specialties. Central venous access was via the cephalic, subclavian, jugular, or axillary vein. Using an introducer and fluoroscopicguidance, the distal tip of the infusion catheter was placed at the superiorcaval-atrial junction. The catheter was tunneled from the venous access site toan abdominal subcutaneous pocket, where the pump was placed.RESULTS: Of the 64 patients enrolled, four exited prior to implantation. All 60implant procedures were successful. At baseline, all patients were receivingtreprostinil via an external pump at a mean dose of 71.4 ± 27.8¾ng/kg/min (range:22-142¾ng/kg/min). The implant averaged 102 ± 32¾min (range: 47-184 min).Clinically significant implant procedure-related complications included onepneumothorax, two infections, and one episode of atrial fibrillation. There were three postimplantation catheter dislocations in two patients. Commonimplant-related events that were not complications included implant site pain(83%) and bruising (17%).CONCLUSIONS: The procedure for inserting a fully implantable system fortreprostinil was successfully performed, with few complications.TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01321073; URL:www.clinicaltrials.gov.",Single arm,Y,,,treprostinil,,,,pulmonary arterial hypertension,,check outcome

Indication for LAA closurewas based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up andtransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were performed per local practice.RESULTS: The baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.5 ± 1.6; the mean age was 73.4 ± 9years; previous transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke was present in 312(30.5%), 155 (15.1%) had previous hemorrhagic stroke, and 320 (31.3%) had ahistory of major bleeding; and 750 (73%) were deemed unsuitable for oralanticoagulation therapy. WATCHMAN implant succeeded in 1005 (98.5%) of patients, without leaks >5 mm in 1002 (99.7%) with at least 1 TEE follow-up in 875 patients(87%). Antiplatelet therapy was used in 784 (83%), while vitamin K antagonistswere used in only 75 (8%). At 1 year, mortality was 98 (9.8%), reflecting theadvanced age and comorbidities in this population. Device thrombus was observedin 28 patients at routine TEE (3.7%) and was not correlated with the drug regimen(P = .14). Ischemic stroke rate was 1.1% (relative risk 84% vs estimatedhistorical data); the major bleeding rate was 2.6% and was predominantly (2.3%)nonprocedure/device related.CONCLUSION: LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device has a high implant and sealingsuccess. This method of stroke risk reduction appears to be safe and effectivewith an ischemic stroke rate as low as 1.1%, even though 73% of patients had acontraindication to and were not using oral anticoagulation.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,

Rivaroxaban for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Active Cancer.,/pubmed/28549819,"Rivaroxaban is broadly used for the primary prevention of stroke and systemicembolism in the general population with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).However, there is little published evidence on the safety and efficacy ofrivaroxaban for AF in patients with active cancer. The aim of this study was toassess the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with active cancer and AF. The use of rivaroxaban in patients with cancer at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center is monitored in the setting of a Quality AssessmentInitiative. Patients with active cancer and AF, treated with rivaroxaban fromJanuary 1, 2014, to March 31, 2016, are included in this analysis. Clinical endpoints were defined a priori and assessed through text searches of medicalrecords. A total of 163 evaluable patients were identified. After adjusting forcompeting risks, the estimated 1-year cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was1.4% (95% CI 0% to 3.4%) and major bleeding was 1.2% (95% CI 0% to 2.9%). Therisk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding leading to discontinuation ofanticoagulation at 1¾year was 14.0% (95% CI 4.2% to 22.7%).

Impact of treatment crossovers on clinical outcomes in the rate and rhythm control strategies for atrial fibrillation: Insights from the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) trial.,/pubmed/28543286,"We investigated the rates and reasons for crossover to alternative treatmentstrategies and its impact on mortality in patients who were enrolled in theAtrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial. Over a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years, 842 patients underwent crossover tothe alternative treatment arms in AFFIRM. The rate of crossover from rhythm torate control (594/2,033, 29.2%) was more frequent than the rate of crossover fromrate to rhythm control (248/2,027, 12.2%, P < 0.0001). The leading reasons forcrossover from rhythm to rate control were failure to achieve or maintain sinusrhythm (272/594, 45.8%) and intolerable adverse effects (122/594, 20.5%). Incomparison, the major reasons for crossover from rate to rhythm control werefailure to control atrial fibrillation symptoms (159/248, 64.1%) and intolerable adverse effects (9/248, 3.6%).

"Predictive Value of Age-Adjusted Charlson Co-Morbidity Index for 1-, 3-, and 5-Year Mortality in Patients Requiring Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair.",/pubmed/28532777,"Co-morbidities increase markedly with aging, and they often negatively affect itsprognosis. Although mortality with transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) issignificantly less than for open mitral valve surgery in patients at highsurgical risk, it remains a concern to identify which patients will benefit from this treatment. Some prognostic metrics have been reported to guide betterpatient selection; however, universal risk stratification measures have not been established. This study aimed to determine if age-adjusted Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) could predict mortality in patients who underwent TMVr and to assess its discriminatory performance in long-term outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed222 patients who underwent TMVr, and 7 who died in hospital was excluded. Coxproportional hazard models were applied to select the demographic characteristicsthat were associated with cumulative mortality. Receiver-operating characteristicanalyses were performed for predicting all-cause mortality, and discriminatoryperformance was assessed. We found that the age-adjusted CCI (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.51, p <0.001), New York Heart Associationclassification, and atrial fibrillation were independently associated withmortality. The age-adjusted CCI demonstrated good discriminative performance for predicting mortality at 3 and 5¾years (area under the curve 0.71 and 0.77,respectively) and were greater than those of the Society of Thoracic Surgeonsscore in receiver-operating characteristic analysis.

Effect of Addition of a Statin to Warfarin on Thromboembolic Events in Japanese Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Diabetes Mellitus.,/pubmed/28532776,"Statins have been shown to decrease stroke risk in patients with cardiovascularrisk factors but not to prevent recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients withatrial fibrillation (AF). The present subanalysis aimed to clarify the efficacyof combined use of warfarin and statins in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF)with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. Theeffects of adding statins to warfarin were compared with those of warfarin alone in patients with NVAF with the data set of J-RHYTHM Registry, a prospective,observational study with a 2-year follow-up. End points included thromboembolism,major hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Of 7,406patients with NVAF and follow-up data, 6,404 patients received warfarin atbaseline. Of these, 1,605 patients also received a statin. Patients in thewarfarin plus statin group showed significantly lower all-cause mortalitycompared with those on warfarin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.38 to 0.87, p¾= 0.0089), although thromboembolic event rates did not differ significantly (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20, p¾= 0.21). In contrast,in 1,223 patients with DM, the warfarin plus statin group showed significantlylower thromboembolic event rates than the warfarin-alone group (HR 0.33, 95% CI0.11 to 0.96, p¾= 0.041). Interestingly, in patients with coronary artery diseaseor with hypertension, the addition of statin to warfarin did not decrease thefrequency of thromboembolic events. In conclusion, in Japanese patients with NVAFwith DM, a combination of warfarin and a statin could be clinically beneficialfor preventing thromboembolic events.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and cardiac comorbidity.

Thestudy was conducted using a Bayesian continuing assessment method using complete remission rate and rate of cardiac events as study endpoints. Between November2009 and October 2011, 50 evaluable patients were enrolled (median age,76¾years). Median baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60%.Ischemic cardiopathy was the most frequent preexisting cardiac disorder (35%),followed by atrial fibrillation (15%), left ventricular hypertrophy (13%), andbaseline LVEF <50% (12%). Based on the intent to treat analysis, overall responserate was 72%, including 28 patients in complete remission (complete remissionrate, 56%), and 8 in partial remission (16%).

Heart rate and outcome in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Differences between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm-A CIBIS II analysis.,/pubmed/28513877,"BACKGROUND: Heart rate has been associated with prognosis in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) and sinus rhythm; whether thisalso holds true in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown.HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate cardiac rhythm and baseline heart rate and the influence of outcome in patients with HFREF enrolled in the Cardiac InsufficiencyBisoprolol Study II.METHODS: In total, 2539 patients were stratified according to their baselineheart rhythm (AF or sinus rhythm) and into quartiles of heart rate (_70 bpm,71-78 bpm, 79-90 bpm, and >90 bpm). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Mean follow-up was 1.3 years.RESULTS: Mean age was 61 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28%, and 80% were male. A total of 521 (21%) patients had AF at baseline. The riskassociated with all-cause mortality for each 5 bpm increase in heart rate inpatients with sinus rhythm (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 1.01-1.11, P = 0.012) was significantly different from those with AF (HR:1.00, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07, P = 0.90, P for interaction_=_0.041).

"Daratumumab plus Bortezomib, Melphalan, and Prednisone for Untreated Myeloma.",/pubmed/29231133,"BACKGROUND: The combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone is astandard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who areineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. Daratumumab has shownefficacy in combination with standard-of-care regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 706 patients with newlydiagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation toreceive nine cycles of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone either alone(control group) or with daratumumab (daratumumab group) until diseaseprogression. The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 16.5 months in a prespecified interim analysis,the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 71.6% (95% confidence interval[CI], 65.5 to 76.8) in the daratumumab group and 50.2% (95% CI, 43.2 to 56.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI,0.38 to 0.65; P<0.001). The overall response rate was 90.9% in the daratumumabgroup, as compared with 73.9% in the control group (P<0.001), and the rate ofcomplete response or better (including stringent complete response) was 42.6%,versus 24.4% (P<0.001). In the daratumumab group, 22.3% of the patients werenegative for minimal residual disease (at a threshold of 1 tumor cell per 105white cells), as compared with 6.2% of those in the control group (P<0.001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hematologic: neutropenia (in39.9% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 38.7% of those in thecontrol group), thrombocytopenia (in 34.4% and 37.6%, respectively), and anemia(in 15.9% and 19.8%, respectively).

The aim of this second interim analysiswas to compare overall survival between the two treatment groups.METHODS: ENDEAVOR was a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial inpatients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were recruitedfrom 198 hospitals and outpatient clinics in 27 countries in Europe, NorthAmerica, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and had received betweenone and three previous lines of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) toreceive carfilzomib and dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or bortezomib anddexamethasone (bortezomib group) through a blocked randomisation scheme (blocksize of four), stratified by International Staging System stage, previous linesof treatment, previous proteasome inhibitor therapy, and planned route ofbortezomib delivery if assigned to the bortezomib group. Carfilzomib (20 mg/m2 ondays 1 and 2 of cycle 1; 56 mg/m2 thereafter) was given as a 30-min intravenousinfusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of 28-day cycles; bortezomib (1à3 mg/m2) was given as an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 21-day cycles. Dexamethasone (20 mg oral or intravenous infusion) was givenon days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 in the carfilzomib group and on days 1, 2,4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 in the bortezomib group. The primary endpoint of ENDEAVOR,progression-free survival, has been previously reported. A stratified log-ranktest was used to compare overall survival between treatment groups for thisprospectively planned second interim analysis. Efficacy assessments were done in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population) and the safetyanalysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01568866, and is nolonger enrolling patients.FINDINGS: Between June 20, 2012, and June 30, 2014, 1096 patients were assessedfor eligibility, of whom 929 were randomly assigned (464 to the carfilzomib groupand 465 to the bortezomib group). The cutoff date for this prespecified interimanalysis was Jan 3, 2017. Median overall survival was 47à6 months (95% CI42à5-not evaluable) in the carfilzomib group versus 40à0 months (32à6-42à3) inthe bortezomib group (hazard ratio 0à791 [95% CI 0à648-0à964], one-sidedp=0à010). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 377 (81%) of 463patients in the carfilzomib group and 324 (71%) of 456 patients in the bortezomibgroup, and serious adverse events in 273 (59%) patients in the carfilzomib group and 182 (40%) in the bortezomib group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverseevents were anaemia (76 [16%] of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group vs 46[10%] of 456 patients in the bortezomib group), hypertension (67 [15%] vs 15[3%]), pneumonia (42 [9%] vs 39 [9%]), thrombocytopenia (41 [9%] vs 43 [9%]),fatigue (31 [7%] vs 35 [8%]), dyspnoea (29 [6%] vs ten [2%]), decreasedlymphocyte count (29 [6%] vs nine [2%]), diarrhoea (18 [4%] vs 39 [9%]), andperipheral neuropathy (six [1%] vs 28 [6%]).

Inthe current study, a treatment regime of lenalidomide (RevlimidÂ), bendamustineand prednisolone (RBP) was tested in patients with relapsed/refractory MM.METHODS: In the previously completed phase 1 study RBP with a dose of 75 mg/m2bendamustine days 1-2, prednisolone 100¾mg days 1-4 and 25¾mg lenalidomide days1-21 was well tolerated.RESULTS: Between July 2011 and September 2013, 25 patients were included in this analysis. The median number of previous treatments was 1 (range 1-2). Twenty-two patients (88%) responded after at least two cycles of RBP (one sCR, five nCR,eight VGPR and eight PR). The median time to first haematological response was28¾days, and median time to best response was 56¾days. Due to increasedhaematological toxicity a dose reduction in most patients required in subsequent cycles of therapy. The median progression-free and overall survival was 22 and38¾months, respectively. In conclusion RBP is a highly effective therapy forpatients with relapsed/refractory MM.

Neutral tumor evolution in myeloma is associated with poor prognosis.,/pubmed/28827410,"Recent studies suggest that the evolutionary history of a cancer is important in forecasting clinical outlook. To gain insight into the clonal dynamics ofmultiple myeloma (MM) and its possible influence on patient outcomes, we analyzedwhole exome sequencing tumor data for 333 patients from Myeloma XI, a UK phase 3 trial and 434 patients from the CoMMpass study, all of which had receivedimmunomodulatory drug (IMiD) therapy. By analyzing mutant allele frequencydistributions in tumors, we found that 17% to 20% of MM is under neutralevolutionary dynamics. These tumors are associated with poorer patient survivalin nonintensively treated patients, which is consistent with the reducedtherapeutic efficacy of microenvironment-modulating IMiDs. Our findings provideevidence that knowledge of the evolutionary history of MM has relevance forpredicting patient outcomes and personalizing therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report an updated intention-to-treat analysis of CALGB (Alliance) 100104 at a median follow-up of 91 months.METHODS: Patients were eligible for this randomised, double-blind,placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial if they had symptomatic disease requiringtreatment; had received, at most, two induction regimens; and had achieved stabledisease or better in the first 100 days after ASCT. We randomly assigned patientsto either lenalidomide or placebo groups using permuted block randomisation, witha fixed block size of six. Randomisation was stratified by three factors: normal or elevated _2 microglobulin concentration at registration (_2à5 mg/L vs >2à5mg/L), previous use or non-use of thalidomide during induction therapy, andprevious use or non-use of lenalidomide during induction therapy. The startingdose was two capsules (10 mg) per day, escalated to three capsules (15 mg) perday after 3 months.

Multiple myeloma can be accurately diagnosed in acute kidney injury patients using a rapid serum free light chain test.,/pubmed/28728609,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with multiple myeloma(MM). Whether serum free light chain (sFLC) measurements can distinguish between myeloma and other causes of AKI requires confirmation to guide early treatment. Arapid and portable sFLC test (SeraliteÂ) is newly available and could reducedelays in obtaining sFLC results and accelerate diagnosis in patients withunexplained AKI. This study evaluated the accuracy of SeraliteÂ to identify MM asthe cause of AKI.METHOD: sFLCs were retrospectively analysed in patients with AKI stage 3 as perKDIGO criteria (i.e. serum creatinine _354¾_mol/L or those on dialysis treatment)(n¾=¾99); 45/99 patients had a confirmed MM diagnosis.RESULTS: The SeraliteÂ _:_ FLC ratio accurately diagnosed all MM patients in the presence of AKI: a range of 0.14-2.02 returned 100% sensitivity and specificityfor identifying all non-myeloma related AKI patients. The sFLC difference (dFLC) also demonstrated high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (100%): an optimalcut-off of 399¾mg/L distinguished between myeloma and non-myeloma AKI patients.We propose a pathway of patient screening and stratification in unexplained AKIfor use of SeraliteÂ in clinical practice, with a _:_ ratio range of 0.14-2.02and dFLC 400¾mg/L as decision points.CONCLUSIONS: SeraliteÂ accurately differentiates between AKI due to MM and AKIdue to other causes in patients considered at risk of myeloma.

Estimating mono- and bi-phasic regression parameters using a mixture piecewise linear Bayesian hierarchical model.,/pubmed/28723910,"The dynamics of tumor burden, secreted proteins or other biomarkers over time, isoften used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and to predict outcomes forpatients. Many methods have been proposed to investigate longitudinal trends tobetter characterize patients and to understand disease progression. However, mostapproaches assume a homogeneous patient population and a uniform responsetrajectory over time and across patients. Here, we present a mixture piecewiselinear Bayesian hierarchical model, which takes into account both populationheterogeneity and nonlinear relationships between biomarkers and time. Simulationresults show that our method was able to classify subjects according to theirpatterns of treatment response with greater than 80% accuracy in the threescenarios tested. We then applied our model to a large randomized controlledphase III clinical trial of multiple myeloma patients. Analysis results suggestthat the longitudinal tumor burden trajectories in multiple myeloma patients are heterogeneous and nonlinear, even among patients assigned to the same treatmentcohort. In addition, between cohorts, there are distinct differences in terms of the regression parameters and the distributions among categories in the mixture. Those results imply that longitudinal data from clinical trials may harborunobserved subgroups and nonlinear relationships; accounting for both may beimportant for analyzing longitudinal data.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prospective Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography at Diagnosis and Before Maintenance Therapy in Symptomatic Patients With Multiple Myeloma Included in the IFM/DFCI 2009 Tri,/pubmed/28686535,"Purpose Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emissiontomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) are important imaging techniques inmultiple myeloma (MM). We conducted a prospective trial in patients with MM aimedat comparing MRI and PET-CT with respect to the detection of bone lesions atdiagnosis and the prognostic value of the techniques. Patients and Methods Onehundred thirty-four patients received a combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) with or without autologous stem-cell transplantation,followed by lenalidomide maintenance. PET-CT and MRI were performed at diagnosis,after three cycles of RVD, and before maintenance therapy. The primary end point was the detection of bone lesions at diagnosis by MRI versus PET-CT. Secondaryend points included the prognostic impact of MRI and PET-CT regardingprogression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results At diagnosis, MRIresults were positive in 127 of 134 patients (95%), and PET-CT results werepositive in 122 of 134 patients (91%; P = .33). Normalization of MRI after three cycles of RVD and before maintenance was not predictive of PFS or OS. PET-CTbecame normal after three cycles of RVD in 32% of the patients with a positiveevaluation at baseline, and PFS was improved in this group (30-month PFS, 78.7% v56.8%, respectively). PET-CT normalization before maintenance was described in62% of the patients who were positive at baseline. This was associated withbetter PFS and OS. Extramedullary disease at diagnosis was an independentprognostic factor for PFS and OS, whereas PET-CT normalization before maintenancewas an independent prognostic factor for PFS. Conclusion There is no differencein the detection of bone lesions at diagnosis when comparing PET-CT and MRI.PET-CT is a powerful tool to evaluate the prognosis of de novo myeloma.",RCT,,,,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT),,,multiple myeloma,detection of bone lesions,

Pharmacokinetics-directed Intravenous Busulfan Combined With High-dose Melphalan and Bortezomib as a Conditioning Regimen for Patients With Multiple Myeloma.,/pubmed/28684379,"BACKGROUND: High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem celltransplantation (ASCT) has a well-established role in the treatment of patientswith multiple myeloma. Melphalan 200 mg/m2 (Mel200) is the most commonly usedpreparative regimen. Several studies have provided evidence for potentialsynergism and safety when combining bortezomib (Btz) or busulfan (Bu) withmelphalan (Mel).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective phase II study to investigatethe safety and efficacy of conditioning with pharmacokinetics (PK)-directedintravenous (IV) Bu with Btz and Mel. Bu dosing was adjusted to target a totalarea under the curve (AUC) of 20,000 _M¾_ min. Patients received Btz (1 mg/m2¾_ 4doses) and Mel (140 mg/m2).RESULTS: A total of 19 subjects were enrolled. Their median age was 55 years, andthe median follow-up period was 23.7 months. PK testing resulted in 86% ofpatients achieving an estimated total AUC of 20,000 ± 2500 _M¾_ min. The overall response rate (ORR) at day¾+100 after ASCT was 100% in the evaluable patients,with 11% of patients achieving a complete response. The 2-year progression-freesurvival rate was 57.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-89%), and the 2-yearoverall survival rate was 88.5% (95% CI, 76%-100%).

Patients undergoing UD-HCT (n_=_93) or HFD-HCT (n_=_59)received RIC comprising busulfan, fludarabine, and ATG, 9_mg/kg, whereas thoseundergoing HCT from matched sibling donors (MSD, n_=_85) received myeloablativebusulfan and cyclophosphamide conditioning or aforementioned RIC with ATG,4.5_mg/kg. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, cyclosporine andmethotrexate were administered. The median follow-up period was 44.7 months afterHCT for 161 survivors. For UD-HCT versus HFD-HCT, there were no significantdifferences in leukemia recurrence, nonrelapse mortality, relapse-free survival, grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD, and moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD. Furthermore, when the outcomes of UD-HCT and HFD-HCT were combined and compared with those ofMSD-HCT, there were no significant differences in leukemia recurrence (3-yearcumulative incidence, 30% versus 29%), nonrelapse mortality (3-year cumulativeincidence, 7% versus 8%), relapse-free survival (3-year estimate, 63% versus63%), and grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD (120-day cumulative incidence, 16% versus13%). Moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, however, occurred less frequently inUD/HFD-HCT (2-year cumulative incidence, 22% versus 40%; P_=_.006). The addition of ATG to conditioning regimen was a significant predictor for less chronic GVHD (subdistribution hazard ratio, .59). In AML in remission, UD/HFD-HCT afterATG-containing RIC achieved leukemia control equivalent to that of MSD-HCT.Despite HLA disparity in UD/HFD-HCT, chronic GVHD occurred less frequently after ATG-containing RIC, suggesting a strong GVHD-modulating effect of ATG.",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Recognition of early mortality in multiple myeloma by a prediction matrix.,/pubmed/28543165,"Early mortality (EM; death___6 months from diagnosis) has been reported inseveral newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) trials. Before the era of novelagents, the incidence was 10%-14%. Causes of death included infections/pneumonia,renal failure, refractory disease, and cardiac events. Staging systems, such asthe revised International Staging System (r-ISS), and prognostic factorsincluding cytogenetics, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and myeloma-specificfactors, are useful to assess overall prognosis; however, they cannot predict EM.We evaluated patients treated with novel agents in the Connect MMÂ Registry andidentified risk factors of the EM cohort. Eligible patients were enrolled in the registry within 60 days of diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses wereconducted to evaluate associations between baseline characteristics and EM.Prediction matrices for EM were constructed from a logistic model. BetweenSeptember 2009 and December 2011, 1493 patients were enrolled in the registry andhad adequate follow-up. Of these patients, 102 (6.8%) had EM and 1391 (93.2%)survived for_>_180 days. Baseline factors significantly associated with increasedEM risk included age_>_75 years, higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status, lower EQ-5D mobility score, higher ISS stage, lower platelet count, and prior hypertension. Renal insufficiency trended toward increased EMrisk. These risk factors were incorporated into a prediction matrix for EM. TheEM prediction matrix uses differential weighting of risk factors to calculate EM risk in patients with NDMM.

Music Therapy for Symptom Management After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation: Results From a Randomized Study.,/pubmed/28533058,"High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) isfrequently performed in patients with hematologic malignancies. ASCT can resultin significant nausea, pain, and discomfort. Supportive care has improved, andpharmacologic therapies are frequently used, but with limitations. Music has beendemonstrated to improve nausea and pain in patients undergoing chemotherapy, but little data are available regarding the effects of music therapy in thetransplantation setting. In a prospective study, patients with lymphoma ormultiple myeloma undergoing ASCT were randomized to receive either interactivemusic therapy with a board-certified music therapist or no music therapy. Themusic therapy arm received 2 music therapy sessions on days +1 and +5. Primaryoutcomes were perception of pain and nausea measured on a visual analog scale.Secondary outcomes were narcotic pain medication use from day -1 to day +5 andimpact of ASCT on patient mood as assessed by Profile of Mood States (POMS) onday +5. Eighty-two patients were enrolled, with 37 in the music therapy arm and45 in the no music therapy arm.

Soluble PD-L1 as a Biomarker in Malignant Melanoma Treated with Checkpoint Blockade.,/pubmed/28522460,"Blockade of the pathway including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and itsreceptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has produced clinical benefits inpatients with a variety of cancers. Elevated levels of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1)have been associated with worse prognosis in renal cell carcinoma and multiplemyeloma. However, the regulatory roles and function of sPD-L1 particularly inconnection with immune checkpoint blockade treatment are not fully understood. Weidentified four splice variants of PD-L1 in melanoma cells, and all of them aresecreted. Secretion of sPD-L1 resulted from alternate splicing activities,cytokine induction, cell stress, cell injury, and cell death in melanoma cells.Pretreatment levels of sPD-L1 were elevated in stage IV melanoma patient seracompared with healthy donors. High pretreatment levels of sPD-L1 were associated with increased likelihood of progressive disease in patients treated by CTLA-4 orPD-1 blockade. Although changes in circulating sPD-L1 early after treatment couldnot distinguish responders from those with progressive disease, after five monthsof treatment by CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade patients who had increased circulatingsPD-L1 had greater likelihood of developing a partial response. Induction ofsPD-L1 was associated with increased circulating cytokines after CTLA-4 blockade but not following PD-1 blockade. Circulating sPD-L1 is a prognostic biomarkerthat may predict outcomes for subgroups of patients receiving checkpointinhibitors. Cancer Immunol Res; 5(6); 480-92. ©2017 AACR.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"High-dose gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan for autologous stem-cell transplant in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma: a phase 2 trial and matched-pair comparison with melphalan.",/pubmed/28522110,"BACKGROUND: High-dose melphalan is of little benefit as a regimen for patientswith relapsed or refractory myeloma undergoing an autologous stem-cell transplant(ASCT). The poor performance of single-agent melphalan in this setting promptedus to study a new high-dose combination of infused gemcitabine, busulfan, andmelphalan.METHODS: We did a phase 2 trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter (Houston, TX, USA). We enrolled patients with primary refractory orrelapsed myeloma who had received treatment with bortezomib, an immunomodulatory drug, or both, or who were receiving a salvage ASCT. Gemcitabine was infused at1875 mg/m2 for 3 h for 2 days, followed by busulfan (target area under the curve 4000 _mol/L per min per day for 4 days) and melphalan (60 mg/m2 per day for 2days). The primary endpoint of this trial was to establish the proportion ofpatients with measurable disease at ASCT receiving gemcitabine, busulfan, andmelphalan who achieved stringent complete remission in accordance with theInternational Myeloma Working Group criteria. We then retrospectively comparedthe patients in this study with all other concurrent patients at the MD Anderson Cancer Center who were eligible for this trial but declined to participate or hadno financial coverage for ASCT in a clinical trial and instead received melphalanat 200 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 min on 1 day, followed by ASCT (controlgroup). To compare survival outcomes, we used a statistical algorithm to select asubset of patients from this control cohort who were matched in a 1-2:1 ratiowith the patients in the gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan group by sex, age, disease status, refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatoryimide drugs, time from diagnosis to ASCT, and cytogenetic risk. All analyses wereper protocol. This is the final analysis of the clinical trial, which isregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01237951.FINDINGS: Between Nov 30, 2010, and Dec 11, 2013, we enrolled 74 patients intothe gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan trial. In these patients, median age was58 years (IQR 51-62), median number of previous lines of therapy was two (2-5),38 patients had high-risk cytogenetics, 17 were unresponsive to all previoustreatments, and 32 were receiving a salvage ASCT. We identified 184 patients for the concurrent control cohort. The study patients and the concurrent controlsreceived similar post-ASCT maintenance. Among patients with measurable disease atASCT, 16 of 65 patients (24à6%, 95% CI 14à2-35à0) in the gemcitabine, busulfan,and melphalan group had stringent complete remission compared with 22 of 174patients (12à6%, 10à1-15à1) in the concurrent control group (p=0à040). Medianfollow-up time was 36 months (IQR 30-46) in the patients receiving gemcitabine,busulfan, and melphalan and 34 months (25-53) in the matched control subset(n=111). With respect to the secondary survival endpoints, the gemcitabine,busulfan, and melphalan cohort had significantly longer median progression-freesurvival than the matched control cohort (15à1 months [95% CI 8à7-22à1] vs 9à3months [8à0-10à7]) with a significantly reduced risk of progression or death (HR 0à55, 95% CI 0à38-0à81, log-rank p=0à030), as well as significantly longer medianoverall survival (37à5 months [26-not reached] vs 23à0 months [16à6-30à5]) and a lower risk of death (HR 0à60, 0à34-0à84, log-rank p=0à0092). For only thepatients treated with gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan, grade 3 or worseadverse events included grade 3 mucositis (12 patients), grade 3 dermatitis (fivepatients), grade 3 aminotransferase elevation (seven patients), grade 3 diarrhoea(two patients), and three treatment-related deaths. One death was cardiac sudden death and two were due to sepsis.INTERPRETATION: Gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan is a comparatively safe and active regimen for ASCT in patients with refractory or relapsed myeloma. Betteroutcomes were achieved in patients who received this regimen than in a concurrentmatched cohort receiving melphalan, although this will need to be confirmed in a prospective, randomised trial.FUNDING: Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization and US NationalCancer Institute.",Single arm,Y,,,"gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan",,,,primary refractory or relapsed myeloma,the proportion of patients who achieved stringent complete remission,

"Pharmacokinetics and safety of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease (ESRD): an open-label, single-arm, phase I study.",/pubmed/28424963,"PURPOSE: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of carfilzomib have been previously studied inmultiple myeloma patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (normal, mild,moderate, severe, and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) at doses of 15 and20¾mg/m2. This study evaluated carfilzomib PK at higher doses of 27 and 56¾mg/m2 in normal renal function and ESRD patients.METHODS: Patients received carfilzomib on two consecutive days/week for 3 weeksevery 28-day cycle: 20¾mg/m2 (cycle 1¾day 1-2), escalated to 27¾mg/m2 on cycle1¾day 8; if tolerated, 56¾mg/m2 starting cycle 2¾day 1. The primary objective wasPK assessment with safety/tolerability and response rate as secondary andexploratory objectives, respectively.RESULTS: 26 patients were enrolled (15 normal, 11 ESRD). There was a trend towardhigher area under the concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration inESRD versus normal renal function patients; however, high interpatient PKvariability was discerned. Relative to patients with normal renal function, ESRD patients showed 33% higher AUC. Overall response rate was 43% for the normalrenal function and 60% for the ESRD groups. Safety findings were generallysimilar between the two groups and consistent with the known safety profile ofcarfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients.CONCLUSION: There were no meaningful differences in PK between patients withnormal renal function and ESRD in light of carfilzomib exposure-responserelationships. These results continue to support dosing recommendation that nostarting dose adjustment of carfilzomib appears warranted in patients withbaseline renal impairment.",Single arm,Y,,,carfilzomib,,,,multiple myeloma,PK assessment with safety/tolerability,

However, promising data on the use of combination therapy withlenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) in this population have raised questions about the role and timing of transplantation.METHODS: We randomly assigned 700 patients with multiple myeloma to receiveinduction therapy with three cycles of RVD and then consolidation therapy witheither five additional cycles of RVD (350 patients) or high-dose melphalan plusstem-cell transplantation followed by two additional cycles of RVD (350patients). Patients in both groups received maintenance therapy with lenalidomidefor 1 year. The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the groupthat underwent transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50months vs. 36 months; adjusted hazard ratio for disease progression or death,0.65; P<0.001). This benefit was observed across all patient subgroups, includingthose stratified according to International Staging System stage and cytogenetic risk. The percentage of patients with a complete response was higher in thetransplantation group than in the RVD-alone group (59% vs. 48%, P=0.03), as wasthe percentage of patients in whom minimal residual disease was not detected (79%vs. 65%, P<0.001). Overall survival at 4 years did not differ significantlybetween the transplantation group and the RVD-alone group (81% and 82%,respectively). The rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly higher inthe transplantation group than in the RVD-alone group (92% vs. 47%), as were the rates of grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal disorders (28% vs. 7%) and infections (20%vs. 9%). No significant between-group differences were observed in the rates oftreatment-related deaths, second primary cancers, thromboembolic events, andperipheral neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with multiple myeloma, RVD therapy plus transplantationwas associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than RVDtherapy alone, but overall survival did not differ significantly between the two approaches.

Multiple myeloma patients in long-term complete response after autologous stem cell transplantation express a particular immune signature with potential prognostic implication.,/pubmed/28368375,"The proportion of multiple myeloma patients in long-term complete response(LTCR-MM) for more than 6 years after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)is small. To evaluate whether this LTCR is associated with a particular immunesignature, peripheral blood samples from 13 LTCR-MM after ASCT and healthy blood donors (HBD) were analysed. Subpopulations of T-cells (na´ve, effector, centralmemory and regulatory), B-cells (na´ve, marginal zone-like, class-switchedmemory, transitional and plasmablasts) and NK-cells expressing inhibitory andactivating receptors were quantified by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC).Heavy/light chains (HLC) were quantified by nephelometry. The percentage of CD4+ T-cells was lower in patients, whereas an increment in the percentage of CD4+ andCD8+ effector memory T-cells was associated with the LTCR. Regulatory T-cells andNK-cells were similar in both groups but a particular redistribution ofinhibitory and activating receptors in NK-cells were found in patients.

Laboratory-confirmed influenza infections wereidentified through seasonal surveillance, sera were collected for influenzahemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) titer assays, and logistic regression models were used to identify the clinical correlates to the HAI serologicresponses.RESULTS: Influenza vaccine was well tolerated, without any vaccine-relatedgrade¾_ 2 adverse events. Only 3 patients (6%) experienced laboratory-confirmedinfluenza.

We piloted dose-attenuated VCD (""VCD-Lite"") in suchvulnerable adults with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with NDMM and a high risk of therapy-relatedtoxicity due to factors above received bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 subcutaneously,cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 and dexamethasone 40mg orally, all on days 1, 8, and 15of a 28day cycle for eight cycles, followed by indefinite, alternating bortezomiband lenalidomide maintenance. Toxicity, overall response rate (ORR),progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS) were determined. The Cancerand Aging Research Group geriatric assessment (CARG GA) was administered atbaseline in an exploratory manner as a predictor of severe toxicity.RESULTS: 14 patients went on the study, which was closed early due to slowaccrual. Intention-to-treat ORR was 64%. 64% of patients experienced grade _3adverse events, the majority of which were unlikely therapy-related. Median PFSwas 24.2months and OS 29.7months, with 14%, 36% and 29% of patients discontinuingstudy drugs due to toxicity, MM progression and other reasons respectively.Baseline CARG GA was successfully completed by all subjects but one.CONCLUSION: VCD-Lite is a viable option for vulnerable adults with NDMM. CARG GA is feasible.

IKZF1 expression is a prognostic marker in newly diagnosed standard-risk multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide and intensive chemotherapy: a study of the German Myeloma Study Group (DSMM).,/pubmed/28017969,"Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory compound with high clinical activity inmultiple myeloma. Lenalidomide binding to the Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligaseresults in targeted ubiquitination and degradation of the lymphoid transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) leading to growth inhibition ofmultiple myeloma cells. Recently, Basigin (BSG) was identified as another proteinregulated by CRBN that is involved in the activity of lenalidomide. Here, weanalyzed the prognostic value of IKZF1, IKZF3, CRBN and BSG mRNA expressionlevels in pretreatment plasma cells from 60 patients with newly diagnosedmultiple myeloma uniformly treated with lenalidomide in combination withintensive chemotherapy within a clinical trial. We found that IKZF1 mRNAexpression levels are significantly associated with progression-free survival(PFS). Patients in the lowest quartile (Q1) of IKZF1 expression had a superiorPFS compared with patients in the remaining quartiles (Q2-Q4; 3-year PFS of 86 vs51%, P=0.01). This translated into a significant better overall survival (100 vs 74%, P=0.03). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant impact of IKZF1, IKZF3 andBSG expression levels on PFS in cytogenetically defined standard-risk but nothigh-risk patients.

The combination of the proteasome inhibitorbortezomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown significant efficacy in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma. We aimed to study whether the addition ofbortezomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone would improve progression-freesurvival and provide better response rates in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were not planned for immediate autologous stem-celltransplant.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patientswith newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 18 years and older from participating Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) and National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN)institutions (both inpatient and outpatient settings). Key inclusion criteriawere presence of CRAB (C=calcium elevation; R=renal impairment; A=anaemia; B=boneinvolvement) criteria with measurable disease (measured by assessment of freelight chains), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of0-3, haemoglobin concentration 9 g/dL or higher, absolute neutrophil count 1 _103 cells per mm3 or higher, and a platelet count of 80_000/mm3 or higher. Werandomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive either an initial treatment ofbortezomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd group) or lenalidomide anddexamethasone alone (Rd group). Randomisation was stratified based onInternational Staging System stage (I, II, or III) and intent to transplant (yes vs no). The VRd regimen was given as eight 21-day cycles. Bortezomib was given at1à3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, combined with oral lenalidomide 25 mg daily on days 1-14 plus oral dexamethasone 20 mg daily on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The Rd regimen was given as six 28-day cycles. The standard Rd regimen consisted of 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day for days 1-21 plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone once a day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a prespecified one-sided stratified log rank testat a significance level of 0à02. Analyses were intention to treat.

Interaction of radiation therapy and radiofrequency kyphoplasty in the treatment of myeloma patients.,/pubmed/28009343,"BACKGROUND: 30% of myeloma patients suffer from vertebral compression fractures(VCF). Consequently, augmentation often becomes inevitable to prevent furtherproblems. This study evaluated the interaction of radiation therapy (RT) andradiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK) in the treatment of myeloma associated VCF.METHODS: Eighty-six myeloma patients with VCF were treated with RFK followed byradiation therapy (RFK group) or vice versa (RT group). Visual analgoue scale(VAS), Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI), vertebral height and kyphosis angle were assessed preoperatively, 3-4 days, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Adverse eventslike cement leakage or additional fractures were documented.RESULTS: Both groups achieved comparable outcomes, but the course of VAS andkyphosis angle differed. Early postoperative kyphosis angles improvedsignificantly in the RFK group, but significantly worsened afterwards. The RTgroup showed a trend towards significantly improvement postoperatively and minor worsening afterwards. VAS remained constant in the RT group and worsened in theRFK group after 6 months. More cement leakages and additional fractures werenoted in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: RFK is an effective method for treating VCF in myeloma patientsindependent of treatment order with regard to radiation therapy. However, RTshould be conducted after RFK to minimize risks of cement extrusion andadditional fractures.",RCT,,,,radiofrequency kyphoplasty followed by radiation therapy,radiation therapy followed by radiofrequency kyphoplasty,,,myeloma patients suffer from vertebral compression fractures,Visual analgoue scale,

VMP (257 cases) and Rd (222 cases) arms of two randomizedphase III trials were employed to assess the treatment influence on outcome inuntreated elderly MM patients. Progression free survival (PFS) and overallsurvival (OS) were the primary and secondary end-points, respectively, and wereinvestigated according to treatments administered over a 60-months follow-upperiod. While VMP significantly reduced the disease progression rate betweenenrolment and 12 months of follow-up, no difference between the two schedules wasfound between 12 and 32 months. After 32 months, Rd-treated patients had a lower incidence of disease progression. A statistically significant higher OS rate was seen in the VMP arm, which was maintained after data adjustment for potentialconfounders. Both approaches showed acceptable toxicity profiles. The profoundtumor reduction by VMP over Rd justifies the initial higher PFS rate in favor of the bortezomib schedule, while the Rd regimen overcomes this evident initialdrawback in reducing the tumor burden by long-term drug administration, gaining asubsequent improved disease control.

[Present-day possibilities of non-invasive control over microcirculation and metabolism in man].,/pubmed/29688190,"The main function of the microcirculatory bed consists in maintaining tissuehomeostasis at an optimal level irrespective of the effect of various externaland internal factors. Of all types of metabolism (diffusive,filtration-reabsorption and vesicular), directly dependent on the haemodynamicparameters is filtration-reabsorption metabolism which provides exchange ofwater, low-molecular-weight and water-soluble substances at the opposite to theheart âpole of the cardiovascular system. The present study was aimed at testinga hypothesis that activation of metabolic processes in man would be accompaniedby alterations in haemodynamic parameters which may be registered by means ofmodern non-invasive methods of examination, i. e., laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and computer-assisted capillaroscopy (CCS). We used actovegin as an activator of metabolic processes. The study included acute pharmacological testing inapparently healthy volunteers (n=28), a course of taking actovegin in patientswith cognitive dysfunctions on the background of arterial hypertension (n=60) andin patients with chronic ischaemia of the lower limbs (n=80). The obtainedfindings of LDF and CCS demonstrated that the known metabolic effects ofactovegin (improved utilization of oxygen and glucose by tissues) wereaccompanied by an increase in the number of functioning capillaries, increasedvelocity of capillary blood flow with a decrease in the degree of hydration ofthe interstitial space, thus reducing the âblood-cell distance for nutrients andproducts of tissue metabolism. Improvement of capillary blood flow was determinedby a decrease in the tonicity of the capillary sphincters, thus leading toreduced arteriolar-venular shunting of blood with predominant supply to thecapillary bed, improved NO-mediated regulation of the value of the lumen of theprecapillary arterioles by the microvascular endothelium, improved reaction ofresistant microvessels to various dilatation stimuli. The obtained results makeit possible to draw a conclusion that modern non-invasive methods of study ofhuman microcirculation (LDF and CCS) are informative not only for assessment ofthe functional state of the microcirculatory bed of the skin but make it possibleto evaluate efficacy of the filtration-reabsorption mechanism of metabolism.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Randomized Trial of Early Endovenous Ablation in Venous Ulceration.,/pubmed/29688123,"BACKGROUND: Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulceration. Althoughcompression therapy improves venous ulcer healing, it does not treat theunderlying causes of venous hypertension. Treatment of superficial venous reflux has been shown to reduce the rate of ulcer recurrence, but the effect of earlyendovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux on ulcer healing remainsunclear.METHODS: In a trial conducted at 20 centers in the United Kingdom, we randomlyassigned 450 patients with venous leg ulcers to receive compression therapy andundergo early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux within 2 weeksafter randomization (early-intervention group) or to receive compression therapy alone, with consideration of endovenous ablation deferred until after the ulcerwas healed or until 6 months after randomization if the ulcer was unhealed(deferred-intervention group). The primary outcome was the time to ulcer healing.Secondary outcomes were the rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks, the rate of ulcer recurrence, the length of time free from ulcers (ulcer-free time) during thefirst year after randomization, and patient-reported health-related quality oflife.RESULTS: Patient and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in the twotreatment groups. The time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-interventiongroup than in the deferred-intervention group; more patients had healed ulcerswith early intervention (hazard ratio for ulcer healing, 1.38; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.13 to 1.68; P=0.001). The median time to ulcer healing was 56days (95% CI, 49 to 66) in the early-intervention group and 82 days (95% CI, 69to 92) in the deferred-intervention group. The rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks was 85.6% in the early-intervention group and 76.3% in the deferred-intervention group. The median ulcer-free time during the first year after trial enrollmentwas 306 days (interquartile range, 240 to 328) in the early-intervention groupand 278 days (interquartile range, 175 to 324) in the deferred-intervention group(P=0.002). The most common procedural complications of endovenous ablation werepain and deep-vein thrombosis.CONCLUSIONS: Early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux resulted infaster healing of venous leg ulcers and more time free from ulcers than deferred endovenous ablation.

Spironolactone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control and arterial stiffness improvement: A prospective study.,/pubmed/29668634,"The present study is to investigate whether spironolactone is better thanhydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for blood pressure (BP) control and arterial stiffnessimprovement. Five-hundred-sixty-six uncontrolled hypertensive patients with 2different classes of antihypertensive medications treatment were enrolled.Spironolactone or HCTZ was randomly prescribed for 4 weeks. Carotid-femoral pulsewave velocity (cf-PWV) was measured at baseline and after 4 weeks' ofspironolactone or HCTZ treatment. Between-group differences were evaluated, andlogistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of cf-PWV increase and incident resistant hypertension. No significant differences inbaseline characteristics were observed between spironolactone and HCTZ groups.After 4 weeks' treatment, both systolic BP and cf-PWV were reduced moreprofoundly in spironolactone group versus HCTZ group (P_<_.05). Pearson andSpearman correlation analysis showed that age, diabetes mellitus, and HCTZ werepositively correlated with cf-PWV, while spironolactone was negatively withcf-PWV. Logistic regression analysis indicated that per 1-standard deviationincrease in cf-PWV was associated with 92% higher incidence of resistanthypertension. After adjusted for spironolactone, no significant associationbetween cf-PWV increase and incident resistant hypertension was observed,indicating that the adverse effect of arterial stiffness on resistanthypertension development might be reversed by spironolactone treatment.

The members of each groupwere then randomly assigned to low sodium salt (LSSalt) or normal salt (NSalt)diets for 6 months. Their blood pressure was measured every 2 months. Serumplasma renin-angiotensin activity, blood biochemical assays and urinarymeasurements were determined at the baseline and at the end of the 6 months.Atthe end of the study, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the ISH LSSaltgroup had significantly decreased by 10.18 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI):3.13 to 17.2, P_=_.006) compared with that of the ISH NSalt group, while the meanSBP only decreased by 5.10 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.02 to 12.2, P_=_.158) in the NISHLSSalt group compared with that of the NISH NSalt group. The mean diastolic bloodpressure (DBP) had no significant differences in the ISH and NISH groups. Noobvious renin angiotensin system activation was found after LSSalt intervention. Regarding the urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood biochemical assays, theLSSalt treatment had the same effects on the ISH group as on the NISH group.Thepresent study showed that the SBP of ISH patients was significantly decreasedwith the LSSalt intervention, while neither the SBP of the NISH patients nor the DBP of either group were similarly decreased, which indicated that ISH patientswere more sensitive to salt restriction.",RCT,,,,low sodium salt,normal salt,,,hypertensive patients,mean systolic blood pressure,
A qualitative evaluation of a physician-delivered pedometer-based step count prescription strategy with insight from participants and treating physicians.,/pubmed/29530385,"AIMS: The integration of pedometers into clinical practice has the potential toenhance physical activity levels in patients with chronic disease. Our SMARTERrandomized controlled trial demonstrated that a physician-delivered step countprescription strategy has measurable effects on daily steps, glycemic control,and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension. Inthis study, we aimed to understand perceived barriers and facilitatorsinfluencing successful uptake and sustainability of the strategy, from patientand physician perspectives.METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of physicians (n_=_10) and participants (n_=_20), including successful and lesssuccessful cases in terms of pedometer-assessed step count improvements. Themesthat achieved saturation in either group through thematic analysis are presented.RESULTS: All participants appreciated the pedometer-based monitoring combinedwith step count prescriptions. Accountability to physicians and support offeredby the trial coordinator influenced participant motivation. Those who increasedstep counts adopted strategies to integrate more steps into their routines andwere able to overcome weather-related barriers by finding indoor alternativeoptions to outdoor steps. Those who decreased step counts reported difficulty in overcoming weather-related challenges, health limitations and work constraints.Physicians indicated the strategy provided a framework for discussing physicalactivity and motivating patients, but emphasized the need for support from alliedprofessionals to help deliver the strategy in busy clinical settings.CONCLUSION: A physician-delivered step count prescription strategy was feasiblyintegrated into clinical practice and successful in engaging most patients;however, continual support is needed for maximal engagement and sustained use.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Blood-Pressure Reduction in Black Barbershops.,/pubmed/29527973,"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hypertension is a major problem among non-Hispanic blackmen, who are underrepresented in pharmacist intervention trials in traditionalhealth care settings.METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic bloodpressure of 140 mm Hg or more from 52 black-owned barbershops (nontraditionalhealth care setting) in a cluster-randomized trial in which barbershops wereassigned to a pharmacist-led intervention (in which barbers encouraged meetingsin barbershops with specialty-trained pharmacists who prescribed drug therapyunder a collaborative practice agreement with the participantsê doctors) or to anactive control approach (in which barbers encouraged lifestyle modification anddoctor appointments). The primary outcome was reduction in systolic bloodpressure at 6 months.RESULTS: At baseline, the mean systolic blood pressure was 152.8 mm Hg in theintervention group and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 6 months, the meansystolic blood pressure fell by 27.0 mm Hg (to 125.8 mm Hg) in the interventiongroup and by 9.3 mm Hg (to 145.4 mm Hg) in the control group; the mean reduction was 21.6 mm Hg greater with the intervention (95% confidence interval, 14.7 to28.4; P<0.001).

Balanced Crystalloids versus Saline in Noncritically Ill Adults.,/pubmed/29485926,"BACKGROUND: Comparative clinical effects of balanced crystalloids and saline are uncertain, particularly in noncritically ill patients cared for outside anintensive care unit (ICU).METHODS: We conducted a single-center, pragmatic, multiple-crossover trialcomparing balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A)with saline among adults who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in theemergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The type of crystalloid that was administered in the emergency department was assigned to each patient on the basis of calendar month, with the entire emergency departmentcrossing over between balanced crystalloids and saline monthly during the16-month trial. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive afterdischarge before day 28).

Is there relationship between epicardial fat and cardiovascular parameters in incident kidney transplant patients? A post-hoc analysis.,/pubmed/29466361,"BACKGROUND: Epicardial fat (EF) has been related to increased cardiovascular riskin chronic kidney disease patients. Kidney transplantation is associated withweight gain, especially within the first 12 months. Recently an associationbetween EF and left ventricular mass (LVM) has been suggested in kidneytransplant (KTX) recipients.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the EF in KTX recipients and its association withcardiovascular parameters in a 12-month follow-up study.METHODS: EF volume was determined using thoracic computed tomography. The EFprogressor group (EF gain) was defined by any increment in EF after 12 months.LVM and LVM index were calculated by echocardiography.RESULTS: Ninety-eight incident KTX patients [57% men, 41.2 ± 10.1 years, meandialysis time prior to transplant of 24 (11-60) months] were analyzed. Atbaseline and after 12 months, EF was 318.6 (275.2-392.6) ml and 329.5(271.7-384.8) ml, respectively (p = 0.03). When compared to patients who EFdecreased (n = 33), those with EF gain (n = 65) had a greater increase of bodymass index, abdominal circumference and blood glucose. These patients also had a lower reduction of LVM index. However in the multivariate analysis, there was no difference in LVM index change between groups (interaction p = 0.565), even afteradjustment for hypertension, glucose and coronary calcium score (interaction p = 0.538).CONCLUSION: The impact of EF gain on ventricular mass after KTX could not bedefinitely confirmed. Further prospective studies in a large sample of KTXpatients should be considered to address a possible causal relationship betweenEF gain and cardiac hypertrophy in this population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predictors of Thrombolysis Administration in Mild Stroke: Florida-Puerto Rico Collaboration to Reduce Stroke Disparities.,/pubmed/29459397,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild stroke is the most common cause for thrombolysisexclusion in patients acutely presenting to the hospital. Thrombolysisadministration in this subgroup is highly variable among different clinicians andinstitutions. We aim to study the predictors of thrombolysis in patients withmild ischemic stroke in the FL-PR CReSD registry (Florida-Puerto RicoCollaboration to Reduce Stroke Disparities).METHODS: Among 73_712 prospectively enrolled patients with a final diagnosis ofischemic stroke or TIA from January 2010 to April 2015, we identified 7746 cases with persistent neurological symptoms and National Institutes of Health StrokeScale _5 who arrived within 4 hours of symptom onset. Multilevel logisticregression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to identifyindependent predictors of thrombolytic administration in the subgroup of patientswithout contraindications to thrombolysis.RESULTS: We included 6826 cases (final diagnosis mild stroke, 74.6% and TIA,25.4%). Median age was 72 (interquartile range, 21); 52.7% men, 70.3% white,12.9% black, 16.8% Hispanic; and median National Institutes of Health StrokeScale, 2 (interquartile range, 3). Patients who received thrombolysis (n=1281,18.7%) were younger (68 versus 72 years), had less vascular risk factors(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia), had lower risk of priorvascular disease (myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, andprevious stroke), and had a higher presenting median National Institutes ofHealth Stroke Scale (4 versus 2). In the multilevel multivariable model, earlyhospital arrival (arrive by 0-2 hours versus _3.5 hours; odds ratio [OR], 8.16;95% confidence interval [CI], 4.76-13.98), higher National Institutes of HealthStroke Scale (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.77-1.98), aphasia at presentation (OR, 1.35;95% CI, 1.12-1.62), faster door-to-computed tomography time (OR, 1.81; 95% CI,1.53-2.15), and presenting to an academic hospital (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.39-2.95) were independent predictors of thrombolysis administration.CONCLUSIONS: Mild acutely presenting stroke patients are more likely to receivethrombolysis if they are young, white, or Hispanic and arrive early to thehospital with more severe neurological presentation. Identification of predictorsof thrombolysis is important in design of future studies to assess the use ofthrombolysis for mild stroke.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss at 5 Years Among Patients With Morbid Obesity: The SLEEVEPASS Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29340676,"Importance: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for treatment of morbid obesity hasincreased substantially despite the lack of long-term results compared withlaparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.Objective: To determine whether laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are equivalent for weight loss at 5 years in patientswith morbid obesity.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Sleeve vs Bypass (SLEEVEPASS) multicenter,multisurgeon, open-label, randomized clinical equivalence trial was conductedfrom March 2008 until June 2010 in Finland. The trial enrolled 240 morbidly obesepatients aged 18 to 60 years, who were randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy orgastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period (last follow-up, October 14, 2015).Interventions: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n_=_121) or laparoscopicRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (n_=_119).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was weight loss evaluated bypercentage excess weight loss. Prespecified equivalence margins for the clinical significance of weight loss differences between gastric bypass and sleevegastrectomy were -9% to +9% excess weight loss. Secondary end points includedresolution of comorbidities, improvement of quality of life (QOL), all adverseevents (overall morbidity), and mortality.Results: Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9] years; mean baselinebody mass index, 45.9, [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women), 80.4% completed the 5-yearfollow-up. At baseline, 42.1% had type 2 diabetes, 34.6% dyslipidemia, and 70.8% hypertension. The estimated mean percentage excess weight loss at 5 years was 49%(95% CI, 45%-52%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 57% (95% CI, 53%-61%) aftergastric bypass (difference, 8.2 percentage units [95% CI, 3.2%-13.2%], higher in the gastric bypass group) and did not meet criteria for equivalence. Complete or partial remission of type 2 diabetes was seen in 37% (n_=_15/41) after sleevegastrectomy and in 45% (n_=_18/40) after gastric bypass (P_>_.99). Medication fordyslipidemia was discontinued in 47% (n_=_14/30) after sleeve gastrectomy and 60%(n_=_24/40) after gastric bypass (P_=_.15) and for hypertension in 29%(n_=_20/68) and 51% (n_=_37/73) (P_=_.02), respectively. There was nostatistically significant difference in QOL between groups (P_=_.85) and notreatment-related mortality. At 5 years the overall morbidity rate was 19%(n_=_23) for sleeve gastrectomy and 26% (n_=_31) for gastric bypass (P_=_.19).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with morbid obesity, use oflaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared with use of laparoscopic Roux-en-Ygastric bypass did not meet criteria for equivalence in terms of percentageexcess weight loss at 5 years.

Appropriate and effective healthpromotion methods used by professional groups remain to be investigated. Thisstudy aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a weight managementprogram among the Chinese occupational population using and a novel informationtechnology exercise prescription.STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3-month open, self-monitored intervention trial,involving individualized pedometer-assisted exercise prescription and a one-time targeted dietary guidance prior to exercise was conducted on the Chineseoccupational population aged 18-65 years in China from 2015 to 2016. Data werecollected from March 2015 to May 2016 and analyzed from June 2016 to August 2016.Participants were also asked to synchronize exercise data of the pedometer to theInternet-based Health System Center daily (at least weekly), by connecting to thepersonal computer (PC) using a USB cable or via Bluetooth.RESULTS: Eligible participants included 802 Chinese occupational persons, and 718of them followed exercise interventions with 89.5% (718/802) adherence to theexercise programs. Of them, 688 participants completed the program with 85.8%(688/802) adherence to the exercise program and their data were analyzed. Weight decreased by 2.2% among all overweight/obese participants, with 1.8% reduction inwaist circumference and 3.3% reduction in body fat percentage (p< 0.001). Weight and body fat percentage in normal-weight individuals decreased by 0.7% and 2.5%, respectively (p < 0.01). A weight gain of 1.0% was observed in all underweightparticipants (p< 0.05), and 68.2% (208/305) of overweight/obese participantsexperienced weight loss, with an average reduction of 3.5%, with 20.2% (42/208)of them achieving weight loss _5%. Blood pressure and fasting serum glucosedecreased significantly in both the overweight/obese and the normal-weightindividuals (p < 0.05). The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower andlifestyle behavior significantly improved (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The prescription pedometer-assisted walking intervention caneffectively improve exercise adherence and manage weight.

Effect of Smoking and Folate Levels on the Efficacy of Folic Acid Therapy in Prevention of Stroke in Hypertensive Men.,/pubmed/29273594,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to examine whether the efficacy of folic acidtherapy in the primary prevention of stroke is jointly affected by smoking statusand baseline folate levels in a male population in a post hoc analysis of theCSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial).METHODS: Eligible participants of the CSPPT were randomly assigned to adouble-blind daily treatment of a combined enalapril 10-mg and folic acid 0.8-mg tablet or an enalapril 10-mg tablet alone. In total, 8384 male participants ofthe CSPPT were included in the current analyses. The primary outcome was firststroke.RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 4.5 years. In the enalapril-alonegroup, the first stroke risk varied by baseline folate levels and smoking status (never versus ever). Specifically, there was an inverse association betweenfolate levels and first stroke in never smokers (P for linear trend=0.043).However, no such association was found in ever smokers. A test for interactionbetween baseline folate levels and smoking status on first stroke was significant(P=0.045). In the total sample, folic acid therapy significantly reduced the riskof first stroke in never smokers with folate deficiency (hazard risk, 0.36; 95%confidence interval, 0.16-0.83) and in ever smokers with normal folate levels(hazard risk, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.99).CONCLUSIONS: Baseline folate levels and smoking status can interactively affectthe risk of first stroke. Our data suggest that compared with never smokers, eversmokers may require a higher dosage of folic acid to achieve a greater beneficialeffect on stroke. Our findings need to be confirmed by future randomized trials.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The primary efficacy endpoint significantlyincreased among patients with CLI compared with those without CLI with a rate of 8.85 versus 4.28/100 patient years (adjusted for baseline characteristics hazard ratio [HR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.16-1.76]; p¾=¾0.0009). When acute limb ischaemiarequiring hospitalisation was added to the model, significant differencesremained (adjusted HR 1.38, [95% CI 1.13-1.69]; p¾=¾0.0016). The 1 year mortalitywas 8.9%. A trend towards increased lower limb revascularisation among those withCLI was observed. Bleeding (TIMI major, fatal, intracranial) did not differbetween those with and without CLI.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 5% of patients enrolled in EUCLID had CLI at baseline. Milderforms of CLI dominated, a result of the trial design. Patients with CLI had asignificantly higher rate of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity versus those without CLI. Further efforts are required to reduce the risk of cardiovascularevents in PAD, especially in patients with CLI. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT01732822.",N,,,,,,,,,,
DPP-4 Inhibitors Improve Diabetic Wound Healing via Direct and Indirect Promotion of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Reduction of Scarring.,/pubmed/29254987,"Patients with diabetes often experience multiple disease complications.Hypoglycemic agents can have both positive and negative effects on diabeticcomplications, which should be carefully assessed when personalized treatmentstrategies are developed. In this study we report that dipeptidyl peptidase 4inhibitors (DPP-4is), a group of widely used antihyperglycemic agents, canimprove diabetic wound healing, independent of their beneficial effects onglycemic control. In particular, DPP-4is promoted the migration andepithelial-mesenchymal transition of keratinocytes, directly and indirectly, byinducing stromal cell-derived factor 1_ production of fibroblasts in vitro and indiabetic mice. In addition, DPP-4is attenuated collagen synthesis and deposition,which may diminish scar formation. Furthermore, the results of a randomizedclinical trial (NCT02742233) involving 67 patients with type 2 diabetes supportedthe role of DPP-4i treatment in diabetic wound healing. Our findings support the application of DPP-4i as a preferred option for treating ulcers in patients with diabetes.",Single arm,Y,,,dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is),,,,diabetes,wound healing,
A pilot clinical study of apatinib plus irinotecan in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma: Clinical Trial/Experimental Study.,/pubmed/29245310,"BACKGROUND: Malignant glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumorthat displays high vascularity, making vascular endothelial growth factorreceptors become promising targets. This study was conducted to evaluate theefficacy and safety of apatinib, a new potent oral small-molecule tyrosine kinaseinhibitor targeted vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, combined withirinotecan, in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.METHODS: Ten patients with recurrent malignant glioma who were experiencingrelapse after treatment of temozolomide were enrolled in this study. Theyreceived oral apatinib (500_mg qd) in conjunction with irinotecan (340_mg/m or125_mg/m depending on use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs) for 6 cycles.After that the patients continued to take apatinib as maintenance. Dosageadjustment occurred in only 3 (30.0%) patients.RESULTS: Among the 10 patients, 9 were available for the efficacy evaluation.There were 5 with partial response, 2 with stable disease and 2 with progressive disease. The objective response rate and the disease control rate (DCR) were 55% (5/9) and 78% (7/9), respectively. The median progress free survival time was 8.3months. As for safety analysis, the most 3 common adverse events weregastrointestinal reaction (31.8%), hypertension (22.7%), and myelosuppression(18.0%).CONCLUSION: Apatinib combined with irinotecan seems to be a promising therapeuticoption for recurrent malignant glioma patients.

"Effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention led by female community health volunteers versus usual care in blood pressure reduction (COBIN): an open-label, cluster-randomised trial.",/pubmed/29241617,"INTRODUCTION: Elevated blood pressure greatly contributes to cardiovasculardeaths in low-income and middle-income countries. We aimed to investigate theeffectiveness of a population-level intervention led by existing community healthworkers in reducing the burden of hypertension in a low-income population.METHODS: We did a community-based, open-label, two-group, cluster-randomisedcontrolled trial in Nepal. Using computer-generated codes, we randomly assigned(1:1) 14 clusters to a lifestyle intervention led by female community healthvolunteers (FCHVs) or usual care (control group). In the intervention group, 43FCHVs provided home visits every 4 months for lifestyle counselling and bloodpressure monitoring. Eligible participants had been involved in a previouspopulation-based survey, were aged 25-65 years, did not have plans to migrateoutside the study area, and were not severely ill or pregnant. The primaryoutcome was mean systolic blood pressure at 1 year. We included all participants who remained in the trial at 1 year in the primary analysis. This trial isregistered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02428075.FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we recruited 1638 participants(939 assigned to intervention; 699 assigned to control). At 1 year, 855participants remained in the intervention group (425 were normotensive, 175 were prehypertensive, and 255 had hypertension) and 613 remained in the control group (305 were normotensive, 128 were prehypertensive, and 180 had hypertension). The mean systolic blood pressure at 1 year was significantly lower in theintervention group than in the control group for all cohorts: the difference was -2à28 mm Hg (95% CI -3à77 to -0à79, p=0à003) for participants who werenormotensive, -3à08 mm Hg (-5à58 to -0à59, p=0à015) for participants who wereprehypertensive, and -4à90 mm Hg (-7à78 to -2à00, p=0à001) for participants whowere hypertensive.INTERPRETATION: A simple, FCHV-led lifestyle intervention coupled with monitoringof blood pressure is effective for reduction of blood pressure in individualswith hypertension and ameliorates age-related increases in blood pressure inadults without hypertension in the general population of Nepal.FUNDING: Aarhus University, Jayanti Memorial Trust.",RCT,,,,lifestyle intervention led by female community health volunteers,usual care,,,hypertension,mean systolic blood pressure at 1 year,
Prognostic Significance of Blood Pressure Variability on Beat-to-Beat Monitoring After Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke.,/pubmed/29229726,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visit-to-visit and day-to-day blood pressure (BP)variability (BPV) predict an increased risk of cardiovascular events but onlyreflect 1 form of BPV. Beat-to-beat BPV can be rapidly assessed and might also bepredictive.METHODS: In consecutive patients within 6 weeks of transient ischemic attack ornondisabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study), BPV (coefficient of variation) wasmeasured beat-to-beat for 5 minutes (Finometer), day-to-day for 1 week on homemonitoring (3 readings, 3_ daily), and on awake ambulatory BP monitoring. BPVafter 1-month standard treatment was related (Cox proportional hazards) torecurrent stroke and cardiovascular events for 2 to 5 years, adjusted for meansystolic BP.RESULTS: Among 520 patients, 26 had inadequate beat-to-beat recordings, and 22patients were in atrial fibrillation. Four hundred five patients had all forms ofmonitoring. Beat-to-beat BPV predicted recurrent stroke and cardiovascular eventsindependently of mean systolic BP (hazard ratio per group SD, stroke: 1.47[1.12-1.91]; P=0.005; cardiovascular events: 1.41 [1.08-1.83]; P=0.01), includingafter adjustment for age and sex (stroke: 1.47 [1.12-1.92]; P=0.005) and all riskfactors (1.40 [1.00-1.94]; P=0.047). Day-to-day BPV was less strongly associated with stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29 [0.97-1.71]; P=0.08) but similarly with cardiovascular events (1.41 [1.09-1.83]; P=0.009). BPV on awake ambulatory BPmonitoring was nonpredictive (stroke: 0.89 [0.59-1.35]; P=0.59; cardiovascularevents: 1.08 [0.77-1.52]; P=0.65). Despite a weak correlation (r=0.119; P=0.02), beat-to-beat BPV was associated with risk of recurrent stroke independently ofday-to-day BPV (1.41 [1.05-1.90]; P=0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Beat-to-beat BPV predicted recurrent stroke and cardiovascularevents, independently of mean systolic BP and risk factors but short-term BPV on ambulatory BP monitoring did not.

Usingmultivariable logistic regression, we identified clinical and angiographiccharacteristics associated with MACE (death, myocardial infarction, urgentrevascularization) to 1 year and developed an integer-based risk prediction modelfor clinical use.RESULTS: In this cohort (median age 60 years, 30% female), the unadjustedKaplan-Meier rates for MACE at 30 days and 1 year were 10% and 28%, respectively.Characteristics associated with MACE at 1 year included reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, hypertension, heart failure, higher-risk non-IRA vessels (leftmain), renal insufficiency, and greater % stenosis of non-IRA lesions. A 15-pointrisk score including these variables had modest discrimination (C-index 0.67)across a spectrum of subsequent risk (4%-88%) for 1-year MACE.CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide spectrum of risk following primary percutaneouscoronary intervention for STEMI patients with multivessel disease. Using readily available clinical characteristics, the expected incidence of MACE by 1 year can be calculated with a simplified risk score, facilitating a tailored approach toclinical care.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
PINGS (Phone-Based Intervention Under Nurse Guidance After Stroke): Interim Results of a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/29222227,"ACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke exacts an immense toll in sub-Saharan Africa wherethere are few resources, and stroke prevention research is limited.

High-intensity interval training lowers blood pressure and improves apelin and NOx plasma levels in older treated hypertensive individuals.,/pubmed/29214526,"Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is one ofthe primary causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Apelin levels and NObioavailability are impaired in older hypertensive patients. Exercise is aneffective intervention for treating hypertension. Our purpose was to evaluate theeffect of high-intensity interval training on blood pressure, apelin, and NOxplasma levels in older treated hypertensive individuals. Thirty treatedhypertensive subjects (61.70_±_5.78¾years, 17 males, 13 females) were randomlydivided into 6¾weeks of high-intensity interval training (n_=_15) and control(n_=_15).

Aldosterone Is Not Associated With Metabolic and Microvascular Insulin Sensitivity in Abdominally Obese Men.,/pubmed/29211893,"Context: Impaired insulin-mediated muscle microvascular recruitment (IMMR) mayadd to the development of insulin resistance and hypertension. Increasedaldosterone levels have been linked to these obesity-related complications inseverely to morbidly obese individuals and to impaired microvascular function in experimental studies.Objectives: To investigate whether aldosterone levels are associated with IMMR,insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure in lean and moderately abdominally obese men, and to study the effect of weight loss.Design, Setting, Participants, Intervention, Main Outcome Measures: In 25 leanand 53 abdominally obese men, 24-hour blood pressure measurement was performed,and aldosterone levels were measured using ultra-performance liquidchromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Insulin sensitivity was assessed bydetermining whole-body glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic clamp. IMMR in forearm skeletal muscle was measured with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.These assessments were repeated in the abdominally obese men following an 8-week weight loss or weight stable period.Results: Sodium excretion and aldosterone levels were similar in lean andabdominally obese participants, but sodium excretion was inversely associatedwith aldosterone concentration only in the lean individuals [lean, _/100 mmolsodium excretion (adjusted for age and urinary potassium excretion) = -0.481 (95%confidence interval, -0.949 to -0.013); abdominally obese, _/100 mmol sodiumexcretion = -0.081 (95% confidence interval, -0.433 to 0.271); P for interaction = 0.02]. Aldosterone was not associated with IMMR, insulin sensitivity, or blood pressure and was unaffected by weight loss.Conclusion: In moderately abdominally obese men, the inverse relationship betweensodium excretion and aldosterone concentration is less than that in lean men but does not translate into higher aldosterone levels. The absolute aldosterone leveldoes not explain differences in microvascular and metabolic insulin sensitivityand blood pressure between lean and moderately abdominally obese men.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We pooled results of a phase 2 (n = 149)and 3 trial (n = 233) of patients randomized and treated for up to 12 and 16weeks, respectively. The starting dose in both trials was three 1-g (elementaliron 210 mg) tablets/day with food, up to 12 tablets/day.

Neprilysin degrades several peptides that modulate lipid metabolism,including natriuretic peptides. In this study, we investigated the effects of 8weeks' treatment with sacubitril/valsartan on whole-body and adipose tissuelipolysis and lipid oxidation during defined physical exercise compared with the metabolically neutral comparator amlodipine. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study enrolling subjects withabdominal obesity and moderate hypertension (mean sitting systolic blood pressure_130-180 mm_Hg). Lipolysis during rest and exercise was assessed by microdialysisand [1,1,2,3,3-2H]-glycerol tracer kinetics. Energy expenditure and substrateoxidation were measured simultaneously using indirect calorimetry. Plasmanonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, insulin, glucose, adrenaline andnoradrenaline concentrations, blood pressure, and heart rate were alsodetermined. Exercise elevated plasma glycerol, free fatty acids, and interstitialglycerol concentrations and increased the rate of glycerol appearance. However,exercise-induced stimulation of lipolysis was not augmented onsacubitril/valsartan treatment compared with amlodipine treatment. Furthermore,sacubitril/valsartan did not alter energy expenditure and substrate oxidationduring exercise compared with amlodipine treatment. In conclusion,sacubitril/valsartan treatment for 8 weeks did not elicit clinically relevantchanges in exercise-induced lipolysis or substrate oxidation in obese patientswith hypertension, implying that its beneficial cardiovascular effects cannot be explained by changes in lipid metabolism during exercise.CLINICAL TRIALREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, we observed a significant,dose-dependent linear trend in proportions of patients with clinical responses(13.6% with a clinical response to placebo; 69.6% to 0.5 g IN; 75.0% to 1.0¾g IN;and 81.0% to 2.0 g¾IN) (Cochran-Armitage trend test P¾<¾.0001 compared withplacebo). Proportions of patients in clinical remission at week 8 weresignificantly higher in the 1.0 g IN group (55.0%, P¾=¾.0004) and the 2.0 g INgroup (38.1%, (P¾=¾.0093) than in the placebo group (4.5%). Proportions ofpatients with mucosal healing were 13.6% in the placebo group, 56.5% in the 0.5 gIN group, 60.0% in the 1.0 g IN group, and 47.6% in¾the 2.0 g IN group (P = .0278compared with placebo). Although mild liver dysfunction was observed in 10patients who received IN, no serious adverse events were observed.CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we¾found 8 weeks of IN(0.5-2.0 g per day) to be effective in¾inducing a clinical response in patientswith UC. However, IN should not yet be used because of the potential foradverse¾effects, including pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Comparison of Different Automated Office Blood Pressure Measurement Devices: Evidence of Nonequivalence and Clinical Implications.,/pubmed/29173603,"BACKGROUND: Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measuring devices areincreasingly recommended as preferred blood pressure (BP) diagnostic tools, butit is unclear how they compare and how clinical environments impact theirperformance.METHODS: This prospective randomized factorial parallel 4-group study compared BPestimates by BpTRU (VSM MedTech, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and Omron HEM 907 (Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) devices in closed vs open areas. Patients diagnosedwith hypertension were recruited during office visits. After baseline open-roomAOBP measurement with the BpTRU, patients had a second BP measurement with eitherthe BpTRU or HEM 907 in either open or closed areas. Absolute BP levels anddifferences between the first and second measurements were compared. Diagnosticperformance was also assessed.RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients were studied. Their mean age was 66.2 ±12.0 years, and 62% were men. The mean of first AOBP estimates was 127.4/73.3 mm Hg. Analyses of subsequent measurements revealed no influence of open or closedareas on BP means and diagnostic performance. Conversely, the Omron HEM 907exceeded BpTRU systolic BP measurements by 4.6 mm Hg (< 0.01) in closed areas andby 3.9 mm Hg (< 0.01) in open areas. The discrepancy between devices wasamplified at lower BP levels.CONCLUSIONS: Although different areas did not influence BP estimates, the OmronHEM 907 significantly exceeded BpTRU measurements on average and especially atlower BP levels. These differences should be considered when interchangingdevices and could have clinical decision impacts in a population of patientstreated for hypertension. Our results support the constant use of only 1 devicetype in a given clinic.",RCT,,,,BpTRU,Omron HEM 907,,,hypertension,Absolute BP levels,
Pulmonary Artery Pressures in School-Age Children Born Prematurely.,/pubmed/29173320,"OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that pulmonary artery pressures were higher inschool aged children born extremely premature than those born at term. We alsowanted to assess whether pulmonary artery pressures differed between childrenborn prematurely with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or betweenthose randomized in the neonatal period to different ventilation modes.STUDY DESIGN: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 193 children bornextremely premature (106 had BPD) and 110 children born at term when they were11-14 years of age. Ninety-nine children born extremely premature had beensupported by high-frequency oscillation and 94 by conventional ventilation.Tricuspid regurgitation was assessed in the apical 4-chamber and modifiedparasternal long-axis views. Continuous-wave Doppler of the peak regurgitant jet velocity was used to estimate the right-ventricular-to-right-atrial systolicpressure gradient.RESULTS: Tricuspid regurgitation was measurable in 71% (137/193) of the children born preterm and 75% (83/110) of the children born at term (P .23). The children born prematurely compared with the children born at term had a greater peaktricuspid regurgitation velocity (2.21 vs 1.95_m/s, P_<_.001) and the childrenborn prematurely who had BPD vs those without BPD had a greater peak tricuspidregurgitation velocity (P_=_.023). There were no significant differences inpulmonary artery pressures according to neonatal ventilation mode.CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery pressures were estimated to be greater in 11- to14-year-old children born extremely prematurely compared with those born at term and in those born prematurely who developed BPD compared with those who did notbut did not differ significantly by neonatal ventilation mode.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Telehealth electronic monitoring to reduce postdischarge complications and surgical site infections after arterial revascularization with groin incision.,/pubmed/29169546,"It is intuitive that postdischarge surgical complications are associated withincreased patient dissatisfaction, and are directly associated with an increasein medical expenditures. It is also easy to make the connection that manypost-hospital discharge surgical complications, including surgical siteinfections (SSIs), could be influenced or exacerbated by patient comorbidities.The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes,smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronicobstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were significantpredictors of SSIs after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care, especially in geographically isolated areas of WestVirginia, is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of complicationsand SSI. This adjunct to existing approaches could lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction, minimizing third-party interventions and decreasing thetotal cost of care. It seems reasonable to believe that monitoring usingtelehealth technology and managing the general health care of patients after ahospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce 30-dayreadmissions and SSIs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Ischemic Stroke Profile, Risk Factors, and Outcomes in India: The Indo-US Collaborative Stroke Project.",/pubmed/29167386,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Indo-US Collaborative Stroke Project was designed to characterize ischemic stroke across 5 high-volume academic tertiary hospitals in India.METHODS: From January 2012 to August 2014, research coordinators and physiciancoinvestigators prospectively collected data on 2066 patients with ischemicstroke admitted <2 weeks after onset. Investigator training and supervision anddata monitoring were conducted by the US site (Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston).RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3±14.7 years, 67.2% men. The median admissionNational Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10 (interquartile range,5-15) and 24.5% had National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale _16. Hypertension (60.8%), diabetes mellitus (35.7%), and tobacco use (32.2%, includingbidi/smokeless tobacco) were common risk factors. Only 4% had atrialfibrillation. All patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonanceimaging; 81% had cerebrovascular imaging. Stroke etiologic subtypes were largeartery (29.9%), cardiac (24.9%), small artery (14.2%), other definite (3.4%), andundetermined (27.6%, including 6.7% with incomplete evaluation). Intravenous orintra-arterial thrombolysis was administered in 13%. In-hospital mortality was7.9%, and 48% achieved modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2 at 90 days. Onmultivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus predicted poor 3-month outcome andyounger age, lower admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale andsmall-artery etiology predicted excellent 3-month outcome.CONCLUSIONS: These comprehensive and novel clinical imaging data will proveuseful in refining stroke guidelines and advancing stroke care in India.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Induced Hypertension for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29158449,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Induced hypertension is widely used to treat delayedcerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, but aliterature review shows that its presumed effectiveness is based on uncontrolled case-series only. We here report clinical outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoidhemorrhage patients with DCI included in a randomized trial on the effectiveness of induced hypertension.METHODS: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with clinical symptoms ofDCI were randomized to induced hypertension or no induced hypertension. Riskratios for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >3) at 3 months, with 95%confidence intervals, were calculated and adjusted for age, clinical condition atadmission and at time of DCI, and amount of blood on initial computed tomographicscan with Poisson regression analysis.RESULTS: The trial aiming to include 240 patients was ended, based on lack ofeffect on cerebral perfusion and slow recruitment, when 21 patients had beenrandomized to induced hypertension, and 20 patients to no hypertension. Withinduced hypertension, the adjusted risk ratio for poor outcome was 1.0 (95%confidence interval, 0.6-1.8) and the risk ratio for serious adverse events 2.1(95% confidence interval, 0.9-5.0).CONCLUSIONS: Before this trial, the effectiveness of induced hypertension for DCIin aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients was unknown because currentliterature consists only of uncontrolled case series. The results from ourpremature halted trial do not add any evidence to support induced hypertensionand show that this treatment can lead to serious adverse events.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

"A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and the Tolerability of a Triple Combination of Amlodipine/Losartan/Rosuvastatin in Patients With Comorbid Essential Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia.",/pubmed/29150250,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy andtolerability of a triple combination of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin inpatients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study wasconducted. Eligible patients with hypertension and a sitting diastolic bloodpressure (SiDBP) of >90 mm Hg and LDL-C levels <250mg/dL were screened. After a4-week run-in period with therapeutic lifestyle changes and losartan potassium100mg once daily, patients who met both blood pressure criteria (80 mm Hg _ SiDBP< 110 mm Hg) and the LDL-C level criteria (defined in the National CholesterolEducation Program Adult Treatment Panel III cardiovascular risk categories) were randomized to 1 of 3 groups and treated once daily for 8 weeks: losartanpotassium 100mg + rosuvastatin 20mg treatment (L/R 100/20) group, amlodipinecamsylate 5mg + losartan potassium 100mg treatment (A/L 5/100) group, andamlodipine 5mg+ losartan potassium 100mg + rosuvastatin 20mg (A/L/R 5/100/20)group. The primary efficacy variables were the percent change in LDL-C in theA/L/R 5/100/20 and A/L 5/100 groups and the mean change of SiDBP in the A/L/R5/100/20 and L/R 100/20 groups after 8 weeks of treatment, relative to baselinevalues.FINDINGS: A total of 146 patients were enrolled and the demographiccharacteristics were similar among the 3 treatment groups. After 8 weeks oftreatment, the mean (SD) percent change in LDL-C was significantly greater in theA/L/R group than in the A/L group (-48.40% [2.77%] vs -6.70% [3.00%]; P <0.0001). Moreover, the mean change in SiDBP was significantly greater in theA/L/R group than in the L/R group (-9.75 [0.92] mm Hg vs -1.73 [1.03] mm Hg; P < 0.0001). SiDBP and LDL-C reductions in the A/L/R group were comparable toreductions in the A/L and L/R groups, respectively. Ten adverse events werereported in 7 patients (4.83%), and 1 patient from the A/L group (0.69%)experienced 2 adverse drug reactions (tachycardia and face edema), which weremild and resolved without specific treatment. There were no clinicallysignificant tolerability issues during the treatment period.IMPLICATIONS: Triple combination therapy with amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatincan be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with hypertension combinedwith dyslipidemia. These findings will form the foundation of the futuredevelopment of a single-pill triple combination.

Impact of Excessive Weight Gain on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes: Results From the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study.,/pubmed/29138273,"OBJECTIVE: Intensive treatment (INT) of type 1 diabetes reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared with conventional treatment (CONV), but it also results in more weight gain. Our objective was to examine whetherexcessive weight gain from INT of type 1 diabetes is independently associatedwith subsequent CVD events.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Quartiles (Q) of weight gain in 1,213 participantsaged 18 years and older at enrollment in the Diabetes Control and ComplicationsTrial (DCCT) were determined within randomized treatment groups (INT vs. CONV)using change in BMI from baseline to the closeout DCCT visits. Effects of thisweight gain on CVD risk factors and outcomes during an additional 20 years ofobservational follow-up were then determined.RESULTS: The Q4 INT group experienced greater proportional weight gain (medianchange in BMI, 6.08 kg/m2), increases in CVD risk factors, and need formedications for hypertension and lipids compared with the Q1-3 INT and comparableCONV groups. Over a mean of 26 years of follow-up, the numbers of major and totalCVD events were not statistically different in Q4 compared with Q1-3 of eitherthe INT or CONV group. By year 14, however, the incident CVD event curve becamesignificantly higher in the Q4 INT group than in the Q1-3 INT groups (P = 0.024) and was similar to that for the CONV group.CONCLUSIONS: For the first 13 years after DCCT, INT for type 1 diabetes reducedmacrovascular events compared with CONV, even when excessive weight gainoccurred. After this, total CVD events significantly increased in the Q4 INTgroup, becoming equivalent to those in the CONV group. Longer follow-up is neededto determine whether this trend continues and results in more major CVD events.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Bioequivalence between innovator and generic tacrolimus in liver and kidney transplant recipients: A randomized, crossover clinical trial.",/pubmed/29135993,"BACKGROUND: Although the generic drug approval process has a long-term successfultrack record, concerns remain for approval of narrow therapeutic index genericimmunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, in transplant recipients. Severalprofessional transplant societies and publications have generated skepticism ofthe generic approval process. Three major areas of concern are that thepharmacokinetic properties of generic products and the innovator (that is,""brand"") product in healthy volunteers may not reflect those in transplantrecipients, bioequivalence between generic and innovator may not ensurebioequivalence between generics, and high-risk patients may have specificbioequivalence concerns. Such concerns have been fueled by anecdotal observationsand retrospective and uncontrolled published studies, while well-designed,controlled prospective studies testing the validity of the regulatorybioequivalence testing approach for narrow therapeutic index immunosuppressantsin transplant recipients have been lacking. Thus, the present study prospectivelyassesses bioequivalence between innovator tacrolimus and 2 generics inindividuals with a kidney or liver transplant.METHODS AND FINDINGS: From December 2013 through October 2014, a prospective,replicate dosing, partially blinded, randomized, 3-treatment, 6-period crossover bioequivalence study was conducted at the University of Cincinnati in individualswith a kidney (n = 35) or liver transplant (n = 36). Abbreviated New DrugApplications (ANDA) data that included manufacturing and healthy individualpharmacokinetic data for all generics were evaluated to select the 2 mostdisparate generics from innovator, and these were named Generic Hi and GenericLo. During the 8-week study period, pharmacokinetic studies assessed thebioequivalence of Generic Hi and Generic Lo with the Innovator tacrolimus andwith each other. Bioequivalence of the major tacrolimus metabolite was alsoassessed. All products fell within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)average bioequivalence (ABE) acceptance criteria of a 90% confidence intervalcontained within the confidence limits of 80.00% and 125.00%. Within-subjectvariability was similar for the area under the curve (AUC) (range 12.11-15.81)and the concentration maximum (Cmax) (range 17.96-24.72) for all products. Thewithin-subject variability was utilized to calculate the scaled averagebioequivalence (SCABE) 90% confidence interval. The calculated SCABE 90%confidence interval was 84.65%-118.13% and 80.00%-125.00% for AUC and Cmax,respectively. The more stringent SCABE acceptance criteria were met for allproduct comparisons for AUC and Cmax in both individuals with a kidney transplantand those with a liver transplant. European Medicines Agency (EMA) acceptancecriteria for narrow therapeutic index drugs were also met, with the onlyexception being in the case of Brand versus Generic Lo, in which the upper limitsof the 90% confidence intervals were 111.30% (kidney) and 112.12% (liver). These were only slightly above the upper EMA acceptance criteria limit for an AUC of111.11%. SCABE criteria were also met for the major tacrolimus metabolite13-O-desmethyl tacrolimus for AUC, but it failed the EMA criterion. No acuterejections, no differences in renal function in all individuals, and nodifferences in liver function were observed in individuals with a livertransplant using the Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons. Fifty-two percent and 65% of all individuals with a kidney or liver transplant, respectively, reported an adverse event. The Exact McNemar test forpaired categorical data with adjustments for multiple comparisons was used tocompare adverse event rates among the products. No statistically significantdifferences among any pairs of products were found for any adverse event code or for adverse events overall. Limitations of this study include that theobservations were made under strictly controlled conditions that did not allowfor the impact of nonadherence or feeding on the possible pharmacokineticdifferences. Generic Hi and Lo were selected based upon bioequivalence data inhealthy volunteers because no pharmacokinetic data in recipients were availablefor all products. The safety data should be interpreted in light of the smallnumber of participants and the short observation periods. Lastly, only the 1 mgtacrolimus strength was utilized in this study.CONCLUSIONS: Using an innovative, controlled bioequivalence study design, weobserved equivalence between tacrolimus innovator and 2 generic products as well as between 2 generic products in individuals after kidney or livertransplantation following current FDA bioequivalence metrics. These resultssupport the position that bioequivalence for the narrow therapeutic index drugtacrolimus translates from healthy volunteers to individuals receiving a kidneyor liver transplant and provides evidence that generic products that arebioequivalent with the innovator product are also bioequivalent to each other.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01889758.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Adjuvant chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer (E1505): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial.",/pubmed/29129443,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected early-stage non-small-cell lungcancer (NSCLC) provides a modest survival benefit. Bevacizumab, a monoclonalantibody directed against VEGF, improves outcomes when added to platinum-basedchemotherapy in advanced-stage non-squamous NSCLC. We aimed to evaluate theaddition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage resected NSCLC.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial of adult patients (aged _18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and who had completely resected stage IB (_4 cm) to IIIA (defined by theAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer 6th edition) NSCLC. We enrolled patients from across the US National Clinical Trials Network, including patients from theEastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) affiliates in Europe and from the Canadian Cancer Trials Group,within 6-12 weeks of surgery. The chemotherapy regimen for each patient wasselected before randomisation and administered intravenously; it consisted offour 21-day cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1 in all regimens) incombination with investigator's choice of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8),docetaxel (75 mg/m2 on day 1), gemcitabine (1200 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8), orpemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on day 1). Patients in the bevacizumab group receivedbevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days starting with cycle 1 ofchemotherapy and continuing for 1 year. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) togroup A (chemotherapy alone) or group B (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab),centrally, using permuted blocks sizes and stratified by chemotherapy regimen,stage of disease, histology, and sex. No one was masked to treatment assignment, except the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. The primary endpoint was overallsurvival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00324805.FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2007, and Sept 20, 2013, 1501 patients were enrolledand randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 749 to group A (chemotherapyalone) and 752 to group B (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab). 383 (26%) of 1458patients (with complete staging information) had stage IB, 636 (44%) had stageII, and 439 (30%) had stage IIIA disease (stage of disease data were missing for 43 patients). Squamous cell histology was reported for 422 (28%) of 1501patients. All four cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens were used: 377 (25%)patients received vinorelbine, 343 (23%) received docetaxel, 283 (19%) receivedgemcitabine, and 497 (33%) received pemetrexed. At a median follow-up of 50à3months (IQR 32à9-68à0), the estimated median overall survival in group A has not been reached, and in group B was 85à8 months (95% CI 74à9 to not reached); hazardratio (group B vs group A) 0à99 (95% CI 0à82-1à19; p=0à90). Grade 3-5 toxicities of note (all attributions) that were reported more frequently in group B (thebevacizumab group) than in group A (chemotherapy alone) were overall worst grade (ie, all grade 3-5 toxicities; 496 [67%] of 738 in group A vs 610 [83%] of 735 ingroup B), hypertension (60 [8%] vs 219 [30%]), and neutropenia (241 [33%] vs 275 [37%]). The number of deaths on treatment did not differ between the groups (15deaths in group A vs 19 in group B). Of these deaths, three in group A and ten ingroup B were considered at least possibly related to treatment.INTERPRETATION: Addition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve overall survival for patients with surgically resected early-stage NSCLC.Bevacizumab does not have a role in this setting and should not be considered as an adjuvant therapy for patients with resected early-stage NSCLC.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.",RCT,,,,chemotherapy plus bevacizumab,chemotherapy,,,early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer,overall survival,

This post hoc analysis investigated therelationship between renal function and clinical outcomes.METHODS: ENSURE-AF was a multicenter, PROBE evaluation trial of edoxaban 60 mg, or dose reduced to 30mg/d for weight_60 kg, creatinine clearance (CrCl; Cockcroft-Gault) _50 mL/min,or concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors compared with therapeutically monitored enoxaparin-warfarin in 2,199 NVAF patients undergoing electrical cardioversion.Efficacy and safety outcomes and time in therapeutic range in the warfarin armwere analyzed in relation to CrCl in prespecified ranges _15 and _30, >30 and_50, >50 and <80, and _80 mL/min, and an exploratory _95-mL/min analysis.RESULTS: A total of 1,095 subjects were randomized to edoxaban and 1,104 toenoxaparin-warfarin. Mean age was 64.3±10 and 64.2±11 years. Mean time intherapeutic range was progressively lower with reducing CrCl strata, being 66.8% in those with CrCl >30 to _50 compared with 71.8% in those with CrCl _80. Theodds ratios for the primary efficacy and safety end points were comparable forthe different predefined renal function strata; given the small numbers, the 95% CI included 1.0. In the subset of those with CrCl _95, the odds ratios showedconsistency with the other CrCl strata. When CrCl was assessed as a continuousvariable, there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher major or clinicallyrelevant nonmajor bleeding with reducing CrCl levels, with no significantdifferences between the 2 treatment arms. When we assessed CrCl at baselinecompared with end of treatment, there were no significant differences in CrClchange between the edoxaban and enoxaparin-warfarin arms. The proportions withworsening of renal function (defined as a decrease of >20% from baseline) weresimilar in the 2 treatment arms.CONCLUSION: Given the small number of events in ENSURE-AF, no effect of renal(dys)function was demonstrated in comparing edoxaban to enoxaparin-warfarin forcardioversion; efficacy and safety of edoxaban remained consistent even inpatients with normal or supranormal renal function.",RCT,,,,edoxaban,enoxaparin-warfarin,,,nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,Mean time in therapeutic range,
High prevalence of non-communicable diseases and associated risk factors amongst adults living with HIV in Cambodia.,/pubmed/29121661,"BACKGROUND: With rapid expansion of antiretroviral therapy for HIV, there arerising life expectancies among people living with HIV.

Of these, 8.8% had diabetesmellitus, 15.1% had hypertension and 34.7% had hypercholesterolemia. Of the totalparticipants with non-communicable diseases (n = 244), 47.8% had one or morediseases, and 75% were not aware of their diseases prior to the study: newdisease was diagnosed in 90% of diabetes mellitus, 44% of hypertension and 90% ofhypercholesterolemia. Single disease occurred in 81%, dual disease in 17% andtriple disease in 2%. In adjusted analyses, those consuming 1 serving of fruitcompare to 2 servings as significantly with diabetes mellitus, those eating 1serving of fruit compare to 2 servings and using lard for cooking weresignificantly associated with hypertension, and those being unemployed, havingmonthly income less than 100 USD and being underweighted were significantlyassociated with hypercholesterolemia.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension andhypercholesterolemia in adults living with HIV in this study was considerablyhigh, with most of these diseases newly identified through active screening inthe survey. These findings strongly suggest that screening of non-communicablediseases should be integrated into routine HIV care in Cambodia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Associations between fatty liver index and asymptomatic intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis in Chinese population.,/pubmed/29121660,"Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolicsyndromes (MetS) have been recognized as the important risk factors forasymptomatic intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis (IVBS). Although fatty liverindex (FLI) is significantly related with these diseases, the association betweenFLI and IVBS remains unclear. In the present study, 2368 participants (30-75years) were recruited from a Chinese prospective cohort study of PMMJS. Amongstthem, 2281 individuals who did not have IVBS at baseline were enrolled in the6-year following-up study. In cross-sectional analysis based on the baselinecharacteristics, the results showed that FLI was positively related with IVBSprevalence. Compared to the participants with FLI < 30, the adjusted OR (95% CI) of IVBS was 2.07 (1.18, 3.62) and 2.85 (1.39, 5.18) in the groups of 30 _ FLI <60 and FLI _ 60, respectively. In longitudinal analysis, the results showed that the participants with FLI _ 60 had an increased risk of asymptomatic IVBScompared to those with FLI < 30 [adjusted HR (95%CI): 1.65 (1.05, 2.60)].Moreover, exclusion of persons with hypertension, T2DM and MetS did not alter theassociations between FLI and asymptomatic IVBS. Therefore, our results suggestthat elevated FLI is an independent risk factor for asymptomatic IVBS in Chinese adults.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effects of four different antihypertensive drugs on plasma metabolomic profiles in patients with essential hypertension.,/pubmed/29121091,"OBJECTIVE: In order to search for metabolic biomarkers of antihypertensive drugresponsiveness, we measured >600 biochemicals in plasma samples of subjectsparticipating in the GENRES Study. Hypertensive men received in a double-blindrotational fashion amlodipine, bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide and losartan, eachas a monotherapy for one month, with intervening one-month placebo cycles.METHODS: Metabolomic analysis was carried out using ultra high performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Full metabolomic signatures (the drugcycles and the mean of the 3 placebo cycles) became available in 38 to 42patients for each drug. Blood pressure was monitored by 24-h recordings.RESULTS: Amlodipine (P values down to 0.002), bisoprolol (P values down to 2 x10-5) and losartan (P values down to 2 x 10-4) consistently decreased thecirculating levels of long-chain acylcarnitines. Bisoprolol tended to decrease (Pvalues down to 0.002) the levels of several medium- and long-chain fatty acids.Hydrochlorothiazide administration was associated with an increase of plasma uricacid level (P = 5 x 10-4) and urea cycle metabolites. Decreases of both systolic (P = 0.06) and diastolic (P = 0.04) blood pressure after amlodipineadministration tended to associate with a decrease of plasma hexadecanedioate, a dicarboxylic fatty acid recently linked to blood pressure regulation.CONCLUSIONS: Although this systematic metabolomics study failed to identifycirculating metabolites convincingly predicting favorable antihypertensiveresponse to four different drug classes, it provided accumulating evidencelinking fatty acid metabolism to human hypertension.",RCT,,,,amlodipine,bisoprolol,hydrochlorothiazide,losartan,hypertension,Metabolomic analysis,
Tolvaptan in Later-Stage Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,/pubmed/29105594,"BACKGROUND: In a previous trial involving patients with early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; estimated creatinine clearance, _60 ml perminute), the vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan slowed the growth intotal kidney volume and the decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate(GFR) but also caused more elevations in aminotransferase and bilirubin levels.The efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in patients with later-stage ADPKD areunknown.METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, randomized withdrawal, multicenter,placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. After an 8-week prerandomization periodthat included sequential placebo and tolvaptan run-in phases, during which eachpatient's ability to take tolvaptan without dose-limiting side effects wasassessed, 1370 patients with ADPKD who were either 18 to 55 years of age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 65 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or 56 to65 years of age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tolvaptan or placebo for 12 months.The primary end point was the change in the estimated GFR from baseline tofollow-up, with adjustment for the exact duration that each patient participated (interpolated to 1 year). Safety assessments were conducted monthly.RESULTS: The change from baseline in the estimated GFR was -2.34 ml per minuteper 1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.81 to -1.87) in the tolvaptangroup, as compared with -3.61 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% CI, -4.08 to -3.14) in the placebo group (difference, 1.27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.86 to1.68; P<0.001). Elevations in the alanine aminotransferase level (to >3 times theupper limit of the normal range) occurred in 38 of 681 patients (5.6%) in thetolvaptan group and in 8 of 685 (1.2%) in the placebo group. Elevations in theaminotransferase level were reversible after stopping tolvaptan. No elevations inthe bilirubin level of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range weredetected.CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan resulted in a slower decline than placebo in the estimatedGFR over a 1-year period in patients with later-stage ADPKD.

Concomitant nonselectivebeta-blockers therapy was not allowed. Patients received either 4¾weeks of oraltaurine (6¾g/day), or placebo, prior to evaluation of HVPG response.RESULTS: Thirty patients were screened and 22 included in the efficacy analysis(12 taurine/10 placebo; 64% male, mean age: 52¾±¾11¾years, Child A: 9%, B:64%,C:27%, ascites:68%).

We conductedan eight-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm clinicaltrial to investigate the effects of daily consumption of freeze-dried strawberry powder (FDSP) on blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness in pre- and stage1-hypertensive postmenopausal women. Sixty postmenopausal women were randomlyassigned to one of three groups: (1) control, (2) 25 g FDSP and (3) 50 g FDSP (n = 20 per group). Assessments of body weight, BP, arterial stiffness as measuredby pulse wave velocity (PWV), and collection of blood samples for analyses ofvasoactive and antioxidant molecules were performed at baseline, four and eightweeks.

Enjoyment of Spicy Flavor Enhances Central Salty-Taste Perception and Reduces Salt Intake and Blood Pressure.,/pubmed/29089370,"High salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension and is associated withcardiovascular events. Most countries exhibit a traditionally high salt intake;thus, identification of an optimal strategy for salt reduction at the population level may have a major impact on public health. In this multicenter,random-order, double-blind observational and interventional study, subjects with a high spice preference had a lower salt intake and blood pressure than subjects who disliked spicy food. The enjoyment of spicy flavor enhanced salt sensitivity and reduced salt preference. Salt intake and salt preference were related to the regional metabolic activity in the insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) ofparticipants. Administration of capsaicin-the major spicy component of chilipepper-enhanced the insula and OFC metabolic activity in response to high-saltstimuli, which reversed the salt intensity-dependent differences in themetabolism of the insula and OFC. In animal study, OFC activity was closelyassociated with salt preference, and salty-taste information processed in the OFCwas affected in the presence of capsaicin. Thus, interventions related to thisregion may alter the salt preference in mice through fiber fluorometry andoptogenetic techniques. In conclusion, enjoyment of spicy foods may significantlyreduce individual salt preference, daily salt intake, and blood pressure bymodifying the neural processing of salty taste in the brain. Application of spicyflavor may be a promising behavioral intervention for reducing high salt intakeand blood pressure.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Long-Term Follow-Up of Cardiac Function and Quality of Life for Patients in NSABP Protocol B-31/NRG Oncology: A Randomized Trial Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) Followed by Paclitaxel With AC Followed by Paclitax,/pubmed/29072977,"Purpose Early cardiac toxicity is a risk associated with adjuvant chemotherapyplus trastuzumab. However, objective measures of cardiac function andhealth-related quality of life are lacking in long-term follow-up of patients whoremain cancer free after completion of adjuvant treatment. Patients and MethodsPatients in NSABP Protocol B-31 received anthracycline and taxane chemotherapywith or without trastuzumab for adjuvant treatment of node-positive, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive early-stage breast cancer. Along-term follow-up assessment was undertaken for patients who were alive anddisease free, which included measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction bymultigated acquisition scan along with patient-reported outcomes using the DukeActivity Status Index (DASI), the Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire, and areview of current medications and comorbid conditions. Results At a medianfollow-up of 8.8 years among eligible participants, five (4.5%) of 110 in thecontrol group and 10 (3.4%) of 297 in the trastuzumab group had a > 10% declinein left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to a value < 50%. Lower DASI scores correlated with age and use of medications for hypertension, cardiacconditions, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but not with whether patients hadreceived trastuzumab. Conclusion In patients without underlying cardiac diseaseat baseline, the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant anthracycline andtaxane-based chemotherapy does not result in long-term worsening of cardiacfunction, cardiac symptoms, or health-related quality of life.

Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase improves pulmonary arterial hypertension in genetically susceptible patients.,/pubmed/29070699,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease with ahigh mortality rate. It is characterized by an occlusive vascular remodeling due to a pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic environment in the wall of resistancepulmonary arteries (PAs). Proliferating cells exhibit a cancer-like metabolicswitch where mitochondrial glucose oxidation is suppressed, whereas glycolysis isup-regulated as the major source of adenosine triphosphate production. Thismultifactorial mitochondrial suppression leads to inhibition of apoptosis anddownstream signaling promoting proliferation. We report an increase in pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase (PDK), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvatedehydrogenase (PDH, the gatekeeping enzyme of glucose oxidation) in the PAs ofhuman PAH compared to healthy lungs. Treatment of explanted human PAH lungs with the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) ex vivo activated PDH and increasedmitochondrial respiration. In a 4-month, open-label study, DCA (3 to 6.25 mg/kgb.i.d.) administered to patients with idiopathic PAH (iPAH) already on approvediPAH therapies led to reduction in mean PA pressure and pulmonary vascularresistance and improvement in functional capacity, but with a range of individualresponses. Lack of ex vivo and clinical response was associated with the presenceof functional variants of SIRT3 and UCP2 that predict reduced protein function.Impaired function of these proteins causes PDK-independent mitochondrialsuppression and pulmonary hypertension in mice. This first-in-human trial of amitochondria-targeting drug in iPAH demonstrates that PDK is a druggable targetand offers hemodynamic improvement in genetically susceptible patients, pavingthe way for novel precision medicine approaches in this disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Central systolic pressure was measured with a validatedoscillometric device, using a transfer function, and mean/diastolic pressurecalibration. M-mode images were obtained by echocardiography, and leftventricular mass was determined by one single reader blinded to blood pressure.We studied 289 participants (137 women) free from antihypertensive drugs (meanage: 50.8 years). Mean office blood pressure was 145/88 mm_Hg and mean brachialand central ambulatory systolic pressures were 127 and 128 mm_Hg, respectively.Mean left ventricular mass was 93.3 kg/m2, and 25.6% had left ventricularhypertrophy. The correlation coefficient between left ventricular mass andbrachial office, brachial ambulatory, and central ambulatory systolic pressurewas 0.29, 0.41, and 0.47, respectively (P=0.003 for comparison between brachialoffice and central ambulatory systolic pressure and 0.32 for comparison betweenbrachial and central ambulatory systolic pressure). The results were consistentfor men and women, and young and old participants. The areas under the curve for prediction of left ventricular hypertrophy were 0.618, 0.635, and 0.666 forbrachial office, brachial, and central ambulatory systolic pressure, respectively(P=0.03 for comparison between brachial and central ambulatory systolicpressure). In younger participants, central ambulatory systolic pressure wassuperior to both other measurements. Central ambulatory systolic pressure,measured with an oscillometric cuff, shows a strong trend toward a closerassociation with left ventricular mass and hypertrophy than brachialoffice/ambulatory systolic pressure.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Magnesium Sulfate as an Adjuvant to Anesthesia in Patients with Arterial Hypertension,/pubmed/29046015,"There is limited evidence showing that elevated arterial blood pressure insurgical patients may be associated with increased perioperative risk; however,cardiovascular instability frequently occurs during anesthesia. The most commonlyused anesthetic agents, both intravenous and inhalation ones, produce a decrease in arterial blood pressure. Magnesium, acting as a natural calcium-channelblocker, induces direct and indirect vasodilatation, thus playing a role in thetreatment of arterial hypertension. In this research, we assessed the effects of magnesium sulfate on cardiovascular stability in patients undergoing diverseplanned surgical procedures (abdominal, orthopedic, urology) under generalbalanced anesthesia, who were diagnosed with arterial hypertension grade 1 and 2.The research encompassed 100 patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 65.Immediately before induction of anesthesia with propofol, the patients in theexperimental group (50 study subjects) received 30 mg/ kg bolus dose andmagnesium sulfate infusion at 10 mg/kg/h, whereas the subjects in the controlgroup (50 patients) were administered normal saline. Anesthesia was achieved and maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl and rocuronium. The hemodynamic variablesof mean arterial pressure and heart rate were measured every five minutes,starting immediately before magnesium infusion. Statistical analysis of thecategorized values of mean arterial pressure and heart rate revealed astatistically significant between-group difference at 60th and 90th minute ofanesthesia. In conclusion, magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant to anesthesia inpatients with arterial hypertension reduces hemodynamic changes duringanesthesia.",RCT,,,,magnesium sulfate,normal saline,,,arterial hypertension grade 1 and 2,mean arterial pressure,

Benefit and harm of intensive blood pressure treatment: Derivation and validation of risk models using data from the SPRINT and ACCORD trials.,/pubmed/29040268,"BACKGROUND: Intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment can avert cardiovasculardisease (CVD) events but can cause some serious adverse events. We sought todevelop and validate risk models for predicting absolute risk difference(increased risk or decreased risk) for CVD events and serious adverse events fromintensive BP therapy. A secondary aim was to test if the statistical method ofelastic net regularization would improve the estimation of risk models forpredicting absolute risk difference, as compared to a traditional backwardsvariable selection approach.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cox models were derived from SPRINT trial data andvalidated on ACCORD-BP trial data to estimate risk of CVD events and seriousadverse events; the models included terms for intensive BP treatment andheterogeneous response to intensive treatment. The Cox models were then used toestimate the absolute reduction in probability of CVD events (benefit) andabsolute increase in probability of serious adverse events (harm) for eachindividual from intensive treatment. We compared the method of elastic netregularization, which uses repeated internal cross-validation to select variablesand estimate coefficients in the presence of collinearity, to a traditionalbackwards variable selection approach. Data from 9,069 SPRINT participants withcomplete data on covariates were utilized for model development, and data from4,498 ACCORD-BP participants with complete data were utilized for modelvalidation. Participants were exposed to intensive (goal systolic pressure < 120 mm Hg) versus standard (<140 mm Hg) treatment. Two composite primary outcomemeasures were evaluated: (i) CVD events/deaths (myocardial infarction, acutecoronary syndrome, stroke, congestive heart failure, or CVD death), and (ii)serious adverse events (hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities,bradycardia, or acute kidney injury/failure). The model for CVD chosen throughelastic net regularization included interaction terms suggesting that older age, black race, higher diastolic BP, and higher lipids were associated with greaterCVD risk reduction benefits from intensive treatment, while current smoking wasassociated with fewer benefits. The model for serious adverse events chosenthrough elastic net regularization suggested that male sex, current smoking,statin use, elevated creatinine, and higher lipids were associated with greaterrisk of serious adverse events from intensive treatment. SPRINT participants inthe highest predicted benefit subgroup had a number needed to treat (NNT) of 24to prevent 1 CVD event/death over 5 years (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 0.042,95% CI: 0.018, 0.066; P = 0.001), those in the middle predicted benefit subgroup had a NNT of 76 (ARR = 0.013, 95% CI: -0.0001, 0.026; P = 0.053), and those inthe lowest subgroup had no significant risk reduction (ARR = 0.006, 95% CI:-0.007, 0.018; P = 0.71). Those in the highest predicted harm subgroup had anumber needed to harm (NNH) of 27 to induce 1 serious adverse event (absoluterisk increase [ARI] = 0.038, 95% CI: 0.014, 0.061; P = 0.002), those in themiddle predicted harm subgroup had a NNH of 41 (ARI = 0.025, 95% CI: 0.012,0.038; P < 0.001), and those in the lowest subgroup had no significant riskincrease (ARI = -0.007, 95% CI: -0.043, 0.030; P = 0.72). In ACCORD-BP,participants in the highest subgroup of predicted benefit had significantabsolute CVD risk reduction, but the overall ACCORD-BP participant sample wasskewed towards participants with less predicted benefit and more predicted riskthan in SPRINT. The models chosen through traditional backwards selection hadsimilar ability to identify absolute risk difference for CVD as the elastic netmodels, but poorer ability to correctly identify absolute risk difference forserious adverse events. A key limitation of the analysis is the limited samplesize of the ACCORD-BP trial, which expanded confidence intervals for ARI amongpersons with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it is not possible to mechanisticallyexplain the physiological relationships explaining the heterogeneous treatmenteffects captured by the models, since the study was an observational secondarydata analysis.CONCLUSIONS: We found that predictive models could help identify subgroups ofparticipants in both SPRINT and ACCORD-BP who had lower versus higher ARRs in CVDevents/deaths with intensive BP treatment, and participants who had lower versus higher ARIs in serious adverse events.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Effect of CPAP, Weight Loss, or CPAP Plus Weight Loss on Central Hemodynamics and Arterial Stiffness.",/pubmed/29038203,"Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea tend to coexist. Little is known about theeffects of obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, or their treatment on central aorticpressures and large artery stiffness. We randomized 139 adults with obesity (bodymass index >30 kg/m2) and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea to (1)continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (n=45), (2) weight loss (WL)therapy (n=48), or (3) combined CPAP and WL (n=46) for 24 weeks. We assessed the effect of these interventions on central pressures and carotid-femoral pulse wavevelocity (a measure of large artery stiffness), measured with arterial tonometry.Central systolic pressure was reduced significantly only in the combination arm(-7.4 mm_Hg; 95% confidence interval, -12.5 to -2.4 mm_Hg; P=0.004), withoutsignificant reductions detected in either the WL-only (-2.3 mm_Hg; 95% confidenceinterval, -7.5 to 3.0; P=0.39) or the CPAP-only (-3.1 mm_Hg; 95% confidenceinterval, -8.3 to 2.0; P=0.23) arms. However, none of these interventionssignificantly changed central pulse pressure, pulse pressure amplification, orthe central augmentation index. The change in mean arterial pressure (P=0.008)and heart rate (P=0.027) induced by the interventions was significant predictors of the change in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. However, after adjustmentfor mean arterial pressure and heart rate, no significant changes incarotid-femoral pulse wave velocity were observed in any group. In obese subjectswith obstructive sleep apnea, combination therapy with WL and CPAP is effectivein reducing central systolic pressure. However, this effect is largely mediatedby changes in mean, rather than central pulse pressure. WL and CPAP, alone or in combination, did not reduce large artery stiffness in this population.CLINICALTRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Maternal and fetal blood lipid concentrations during pregnancy differ by maternal body mass index: findings from the ROLO study.,/pubmed/29037224,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a time of altered metabolic functioning and maternalblood lipid profiles change to accommodate the developing fetus. While thesechanges are physiologically necessary, blood lipids concentrations have beenassociated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational diabetes,pregnancy-induced hypertension and high birth weight. As blood lipids are notroutinely measured during pregnancy, there is limited information on what isconsidered normal during pregnancy and in fetal blood.METHODS: Data from 327 mother-child pairs from the ROLO longitudinal birth cohortstudy were analysed. Fasting total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured inearly and late pregnancy and fetal cord blood. Intervals were calculated usingthe 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th centile. Data was stratified based on maternal bodymass index (BMI) measured during early pregnancy. Differences in blood lipidsbetween BMI categories were explored using ANOVA and infant outcomes ofmacrosomia and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) were explored using independentstudent T-tests and binary logistic regression.RESULTS: All maternal blood lipid concentrations increased significantly fromearly to late pregnancy. In early pregnancy, women with a BMI¾<¾25¾kg/m2 hadlower concentrations of total cholesterol compared to women¾with a BMIof¾25-29.9¾kg/m2 (P¾=¾0.02). With triglycerides, women¾in the obese category(BMI¾>¾30¾kg/m2) had higher concentrations than both women in the¾normal-weightand overweight category in early and late pregnancy (P¾<¾0.001 and P¾=¾0.03,respectively). In late pregnancy, triglyceride concentrations remained elevatedin women¾in the obese category compared to women in the¾normal-weight¾category(P¾=¾0.01). Triglyceride concentrations were also elevated in late pregnancy inmothers that then gave birth to¾infants with macrosomia and LGA (P¾=¾0.01 andP¾=¾0.03, respectively).CONCLUSION: Blood lipid concentrations increase during pregnancy and differ bymaternal BMI. These intervals could help to inform the development of references for blood lipid concentrations during pregnancy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ROLO Study - ISRCTN54392969 .

Association between percent decline in serum total homocysteine and risk of first stroke.,/pubmed/29030456,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a change in serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels is associated with first stroke risk in a post hoc analysis of the China StrokePrimary Prevention Trial (CSPPT).METHODS: We analyzed 16,867 participants of the CSPPT with tHcy measurements atboth baseline and exit visits. The primary outcome was first stroke. Thesecondary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events consisting ofcardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The percent decline intHcy was calculated as [(baseline tHcy - exit tHcy)/baseline tHcy _ 100].RESULTS: Over the median treatment duration of 4.5 years, participants whodeveloped a first stroke had a significantly lower percent decline in tHcy (_ =-5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.8 to -2.6) compared to their counterparts. A 20% tHcy decline was associated with a reduction in stroke risk of 7% (hazardratio [HR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.90-0.97). When percent decline in tHcy was assessed as tertiles, a significantly lower stroke risk was found in those in tertiles 2-3(HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64-0.97) compared with participants in tertile 1. Similarresults were observed for the composite of cardiovascular events. The beneficial effect associated with greater tHcy reduction was observed across strata for age,sex, treatment group (with vs without folic acid), MTHFR C677T genotypes,baseline tHcy and serum folate levels, and blood pressure control.CONCLUSIONS: Percent lowering in tHcy was significantly associated with areduction in first stroke risk in Chinese adults with hypertension, and iffurther confirmed, may serve as a useful indicator for folic acid treatmentefficacy on stroke prevention.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00794885.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl to prevent haemodynamic response to skull pin application in neurosurgery: double blind randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/29027653,"BACKGROUND: Skull pin application during craniotomy is a highly noxious stimulus.Therefore, the attenuated effect between dexmedetomidine and fentanyl wasinvestigated.METHOD: A randomized, double-blind controlled trial included sixty patients,randomly allocated into groups A and B. After patients entered the operativeroom, blood pressure and heart rate were measured (T1). At 5 minutes afterpropofol induction (T2), group A received dexmedetomidine 1 µg kg__ whereas groupB received normal saline. At 3 minutes before skull pin insertion (T3), group Breceived a single bolus of fentanyl 1 µg kg__ whereas group A received normalsaline. The hemodynamic responses were recorded at 1 minute before skull pininsertion (T4), during skull pin insertion (T5), then repeated every minute for 5minutes (T6-T10).RESULTS: Controlling blood pressure in the dexmedetomidine group (Group A) wasbetter than in the fentanyl group (Group B) at T4 and T10 (P < 0.05) and T5-T8 (P< 0.01) for systolic blood pressure whereas diastolic blood pressure wassignificantly different at T4 and T8 (P < 0.05) and T5-T7 (P < 0.01).

A randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a ketamine infusion on tourniquet hypertension during general anaesthesia in patients undergoing upper and lower limb surgery.,/pubmed/29026385,"BACKGROUND: Tourniquet hypertension arising from tourniquet inflation remains aprimary concern to the anaesthetist. One drug commonly used to manage tourniquet hypertension is ketamine. No studies have examined the effect of ketamine ontourniquet hypertension for a period of more than one hour or an infusion of the same.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of an intravenous infusion of ketamine versusplacebo on tourniquet induced hypertension in patients undergoing upper and lowerlimb surgery under general anaesthesia.METHODS: Forty six adult patients scheduled for upper and lower limb surgeryunder general anaesthesia were randomized into two equal groups. The ketaminegroup received an intravenous bolus of 0.1mg/kg of ketamine followed by aninfusion of 2ug/kg/min. The saline group received an intravenous bolus ofphysiological saline followed by an infusion of saline. All the patients werereviewed post-operatively. Data of the baseline characteristics, haemodynamicchanges, post-tourniquet pain and side effects were collected. If post-tourniquetpain was present post-operatively, a visual analogue scale (VAS) was used toassess its severity.RESULTS: 46 patients successfully completed the trial. There were no significant differences between the groups for baseline patient demographics. The incidenceof tourniquet hypertension was higher in the saline group (26.1%) compared withketamine group (4.6%) with a 95% confidence interval. The difference was shown tobe statistically significant ('P'<0.05). There was an increase in systolic blood pressure after 60 minutes of tourniquet inflation in the saline group but thedifference was not statistically significant('P'>0.866).

Statistically, there was no difference found between the two groups. Side effects were minimalin the ketamine group whilst in the saline group, nausea and vomiting werepredominant but were also not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, there was a difference in theproportion of tourniquet hypertension between the ketamine and saline groups for patients undergoing upper and lower limb orthopaedic surgery under generalanaesthesia.",RCT,,,,ketamine,placebo,,,Tourniquet hypertension,incidence of tourniquet hypertension,
Neuroimaging Correlates of Cerebral Microbleeds: The ARIC Study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities).,/pubmed/29018129,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleed (CMB) location (deep versus strictly lobar) may elucidate underlying pathology with deep CMBs being more associatedwith hypertensive vascular disease and lobar CMBs being more associated withcerebral amyloid angiopathy. The objective of this study was to determine whetherneuroimaging signs of vascular disease and Alzheimer pathology are associatedwith different types of CMBs.METHODS: Among 1677 nondemented ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities)participants (mean age=76±5 years; 40% men; 26% black) with 3-Tesla MRI scans at the fifth examination (2011-2013), we fit multinomial logistic regression models to quantify relationships of brain volumes (Alzheimer disease signature regions, total gray matter, frontal gray matter, and white matter hyperintensity volumes),infarct frequencies (lacunar, nonlacunar, and total), and apolipoprotein E(number of _4 alleles) with CMB location (none, deep/mixed, or strictly lobarCMBs). Models were weighted for the sample selection scheme and adjusted for age,sex, education, hypertension, ever smoking status, diabetes mellitus, race sitemembership, and estimated intracranial volume (brain volume models only).RESULTS: Deep/mixed and strictly lobar CMBs had prevalences of 8% and 16%,respectively. Larger white matter hyperintensity burden, greater total infarctfrequency, smaller frontal volumes (in women only), and smaller total gray mattervolume were associated with greater risk of both deep and lobar CMBs relative to no CMBs. Greater white matter hyperintensity volume was also associated withgreater risk of deep relative to lobar CMBs. Higher lacunar and nonlacunarinfarct frequencies were associated with higher risk of deep CMBs, whereassmaller Alzheimer disease signature region volume and apolipoprotein E _4homozygosity were associated with greater risk of lobar CMBs.CONCLUSIONS: CMBs are a common vascular pathology in the elderly. Markers ofhypertensive small-vessel disease may contribute to deep CMBs while cerebralamyloid angiopathy may drive development of lobar CMBs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Abdominal Aortic Calcifications Influences the Systemic and Renal Hemodynamic Response to Renal Denervation in the DENERHTN (Renal Denervation for Hypertension) Trial.,/pubmed/29018027,"BACKGROUND: The DENERHTN (Renal Denervation for Hypertension) trial confirmed theefficacy of renal denervation (RDN) in lowering daytime ambulatory systolic bloodpressure when added to standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment(SSAHT) for resistant hypertension at 6¾months.METHODS AND RESULTS: This post hoc exploratory analysis assessed the impact ofabdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) on the hemodynamic and renal response toRDN at 6¾months. In total, 106 patients with resistant hypertension were randomlyassigned to RDN plus SSAHT or to the same SSAHT alone (control group). Total AAC volume was measured, with semiautomatic software and blind to randomization, fromthe aortic hiatus to the iliac bifurcation using the prerandomization noncontrastabdominal computed tomography scans of 90 patients. Measurements were expressedas tertiles. The baseline-adjusted difference in the change in daytime ambulatorysystolic blood pressure from baseline to 6¾months between the RDN and controlgroups was -10.1¾mm¾Hg (P=0.0462) in the lowest tertile and -2.5¾mm¾Hg (P=0.4987)in the 2 highest tertiles of AAC volume. Estimated glomerular filtration rateremained stable at 6¾months for the patients in the lowest tertile of AAC volume who underwent RDN (+2.5¾mL/min per 1.73¾m2) but decreased in the control group(-8.0¾mL/min per 1.73¾m2, P=0.0148). In the 2 highest tertiles of AAC volume,estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased similarly in the RDN and controlgroups (P=0.2640).CONCLUSIONS: RDN plus SSAHT resulted in a larger decrease in daytime ambulatorysystolic blood pressure than SSAHT alone in patients with a lower AAC burden thanin those with a higher AAC burden. This larger decrease in daytime ambulatorysystolic blood pressure was not associated with a decrease in estimatedglomerular filtration rate.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Higher Adiposity Is Associated With Slower Cognitive Decline in Hypertensive Patients: Secondary Analysis of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial.,/pubmed/29018022,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases. However, the potentialassociation between adiposity and cognitive decline in hypertensive patients isinconclusive. We performed a secondary data analysis of the CSPPT (China StrokePrimary Prevention Trial) to examine whether adiposity is correlated withlongitudinal cognitive performance in hypertensive adults.METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis included 16¾791 patients in the CSPPT whoreceived at least 2 cognitive assessments by the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE) during the follow-up (median, 4.5 years; interquartile range, 4.2-4.8years). Outcomes included changes in MMSE scores and cognitive impairment(defined as MMSE score less than education-specific cutoff point). A¾markedreduction in MMSE scores at the final (compared with at the 1-year) follow-up wasapparent in both men (n=4838; mean [SD] score, 0.41 [3.62]) and women (n=7190;mean [SD] score, 1.07 [4.61]; both P<0.001). Analysis using a mixed-effects modelrevealed an association between higher body mass index with less MMSE decline,even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities (men, _=0.0134 [SE,0.0036]; women, _=0.0133 [SE, 0.0034]; both P<0.001). A total of 1037 men (15.3%)and 3317 women (33.1%) developed cognitive impairment. In multivariable Coxregression analyses, being obese in men (11.3% versus 18.0%; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.94) and women (30.1% versus 36.5%; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.91) was a protective factor againstcognitive impairment compared with normal body mass index.CONCLUSIONS: Higher adiposity is independently associated with slower cognitivedecline in Chinese hypertensive adults.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Time Course of Change in Blood Pressure From Sodium Reduction and the DASH Diet.,/pubmed/28993451,"Both sodium reduction and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietlower blood pressure (BP); however, the patterns of their effects on BP over timeare unknown. In the DASH-Sodium trial, adults with pre-/stage 1 hypertension, notusing antihypertensive medications, were randomly assigned to either a typicalAmerican diet (control) or DASH. Within their assigned diet, participantsrandomly ate each of 3 sodium levels (50, 100, and 150 mmol/d, at 2100 kcal) over4-week periods. BP was measured weekly for 12 weeks; 412 participants enrolled(57% women; 57% black; mean age, 48 years; mean systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP[DBP], 135/86 mm Hg). For those assigned control, there was no change in SBP/DBP between weeks 1 and 4 on the high-sodium diet (weekly change, -0.04/0.06 mmHg/week) versus a progressive decline in BP on the low-sodium diet (-0.94/-0.70mm Hg/week; P interactions between time and sodium <0.001 for SBP and DBP). Forthose assigned DASH, SBP/DBP changed -0.60/-0.16 mm Hg/week on the high- versus-0.42/-0.54 mm Hg/week on the low-sodium diet (P interactions between time andsodium=0.56 for SBP and 0.10 for DBP). When comparing DASH to control, DASHchanged SBP/DBP by -4.36/-1.07 mm Hg after 1 week, which accounted for most ofthe effect observed, with no significant difference in weekly rates of change foreither SBP (P interaction=0.97) or DBP (P interaction=0.70). In the context of a typical American diet, a low-sodium diet reduced BP without plateau, suggestingthat the full effects of sodium reduction are not completely achieved by 4 weeks.In contrast, compared with control, DASH lowers BP within a week without further effect thereafter.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Sodium and Fluid Excretion With Torsemide in Healthy Subjects is Limited by the Short Duration of Diuretic Action.,/pubmed/28982672,"BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are highly natriuretic but their short duration ofaction permits postdiuretic sodium retention, which limits salt loss unlessdietary salt is severely restricted. We tested the hypothesis that a moreprolonged duration of action would enhance salt loss.METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten healthy participants were crossed over between 20¾mg of oral immediate-release or extended-release (ER) torsemide while consuming a fixeddiet with 300¾mmolàd-1 of Na+. Compared with immediate-release, plasma torsemide after ER was 59% lower at 1 to 3¾hours but 97% higher at 8 to 10¾hours as aresult of a >3-fold prolongation of time to maximal plasma concentrations. Therelationship of natriuresis to log torsemide excretion showed marked hysteresis, but participants spent twice as long with effective concentrations of torsemideafter ER, thereby enhancing diuretic efficiency. Compared with immediate-release,ER torsemide did not reduce creatinine clearance and increased fluid (1634±385versus 728±445¾mL, P<0.02) and Na+ output (98±15 versus 42±17¾mmol, P<0.05)despite an 18% reduction in exposure. Neither formulation increased K+ excretion.CONCLUSIONS: Torsemide ER prolongs urine drug levels, thereby increasing the timespent with effective drug concentrations, reduces postdiuretic Na+ retention, andmoderates a fall in glomerular filtration rate. It caused significant Na+ losseven during very high salt intake. Thus, a short duration of action limits saltloss with loop diuretics.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibition by Copanlisib in Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Lymphoma.,/pubmed/28976790,"Purpose Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is critical for theproliferation and survival of malignant B cells. Copanlisib, a pan-class I PI3Kinhibitor with predominant activity against PI3K-_ and -_ isoforms, hasdemonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with indolentlymphoma. Patients and Methods In this phase II study, 142 patients with relapsedor refractory indolent lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy were enrolled to receive copanlisib 60 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.The primary end point was objective response rate; secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Inaddition, safety and gene expression were evaluated. Results Median age was 63years (range, 25 to 82 years), and patients had received a median of three(range, two to nine) prior regimens. The objective response rate was 59% (84 of142 patients); 12% of patients achieved a complete response. Median time toresponse was 53 days. Median duration of response was 22.6 months, medianprogression-free survival was 11.2 months, and median overall survival had notyet been reached. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events weretransient hyperglycemia (all grades, 50%; grade 3 or 4, 41%) and transienthypertension (all grades, 30%; grade 3, 24%). Other grade _3 events includeddecreased neutrophil count (24%) and lung infection (15%). High response rates tocopanlisib were associated with high expression of PI3K/B-cell receptor signalingpathway genes.

Effect of a Community Health Worker-Led Multicomponent Intervention on Blood Pressure Control in Low-Income Patients in Argentina: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/28975305,"Importance: Despite extensive knowledge of hypertension treatment, the prevalenceof uncontrolled hypertension is high and increasing in low- and middle-incomecountries.Objective: To test whether a community health worker-led multicomponentintervention would improve blood pressure (BP) control among low-income patients with hypertension.Design, Setting, and Participants: A cluster randomized trial was conducted in 18centers for primary health care within a national public system providing freemedications and health care to uninsured patients in Argentina. A total of 1432low-income adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited betweenJune 2013 and April 2015 and followed up to October 2016.Interventions: Nine centers (743 patients) were randomized to the multicomponent intervention, which included a community health worker-led home intervention(health coaching, home BP monitoring, and BP audit and feedback), a physicianintervention, and a text-messaging intervention over 18 months. Nine centers (689patients) were randomized to usual care.Main Outcomes and Measures: The coprimary outcomes were the differences insystolic and diastolic BP changes from baseline to the end of follow-up ofpatients with hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the proportion ofpatients with controlled hypertension (BP <140/90 mm Hg). Three BP measurementswere obtained at each of 2 baseline and 2 termination visits using a standardprotocol, the means of which were used for analyses.Results: Of 1432 participants (mean age, 55.8 years [SD, 13.3]; 772 women[53.0%]), 1357 (94.8%) completed the trial. Baseline mean systolic BP was 151.7mm Hg for the intervention group and 149.8 mm Hg for the usual care group; themean diastolic BP was 92.2 mm Hg for the intervention group and 90.1 mm Hg forthe usual care group. Systolic BP reduction from baseline to month 18 was 19.3 mmHg (95% CI, 17.9-20.8 mm Hg) for the intervention group and 12.7 mm Hg (95% CI,11.3-14.2 mm Hg) for the usual care group; the difference in the reduction was6.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.6-8.6; P_<_.001). Diastolic BP decreased by 12.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 11.2-13.2 mm Hg) in the intervention group and 6.9 mm Hg (95% CI, 5.9-7.8 mm Hg) in the control group; the difference in the reduction was 5.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.0-6.8 mm Hg; P_<_.001). The proportion of patients with controlled hypertensionincreased from 17.0% at baseline to 72.9% at 18 months in the intervention group and from 17.6% to 52.2% in the usual care group; the difference in the increasewas 20.6% (95% CI, 15.4%-25.9%; P_<_.001). No adverse events were reported.Conclusions and Relevance: Low-income patients in Argentina with uncontrolledhypertension who participated in a community health worker-led multicomponentintervention experienced a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic BP than didpatients who received usual care over 18 months. Further research is needed toassess generalizability and cost-effectiveness of this intervention and tounderstand which components may have contributed most to the outcome.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01834131.",RCT,,,,"community health worker-led multicomponentintervention",usual care,,,uncontrolled hypertension,differences in systolic and diastolic BP changes from baseline to the end of follow-up,
"Serum Potassium Is Positively Associated With Stroke and Mortality in the Large, Population-Based Malm__ Preventive Project Cohort.",/pubmed/28974633,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low serum potassium is associated with stroke inpopulations with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus but has not been studied in a mainly healthy population. We aimed to study therelation between serum potassium and incident stroke and mortality in the Malm_Preventive Project, a large cohort with screening in early mid-life and follow-up>25 years.METHODS: Serum potassium measurements and covariates were available in 21_353individuals (79% men, mean age 44 years). Mean follow-up time was 26.9 years for stroke analyses and 29.3 years for mortality analyses. There were 2061 incidentstroke events and 8709 deaths. Cox regression analyses adjusted for multiplestroke risk factors (age, sex, height, weight, systolic blood pressure, fastingblood glucose, serum sodium, current smoking, prevalent diabetes mellitus,prevalent coronary artery disease, and treatment for hypertension) were fitted.RESULTS: There was an independent, linear association between serum potassium,per mmol/L increase, and both stroke (hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidenceinterval, 1.17-1.52; P<0.0001) and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.28; P<0.0001). This was significant in subjects both older andyounger than the median age (46.5 years), and there was evidence of aninteraction with serum sodium. The association was positive and significant forboth ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage and in both hypertensive andnormotensive subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Serum potassium, measured in early mid-life, was linearly associatedwith both incidence of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage and all-causemortality. An interaction with serum sodium implies that factors related toelectrolyte balance and incident hypertension may be mediating factors.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Outcomes of Primary and Secondary Carotid Artery Stenting.,/pubmed/28974632,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known of the excess risk attributable tosecondary carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study evaluates outcomesof redo-CAS and CAS after prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CASAPICEA)relative to primary-CAS.METHODS: We studied all patients in the Vascular Quality Initiative, whounderwent primary-CAS, CASAPICEA, or redo-CAS (2003-2016). Kaplan-Meier,multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate outcomeswithin 30 days and up to 1 year and identify their predictors.RESULTS: There were 11_742 CAS procedures performed: 8519 (72%) primary-, 2645(23%) CASAPICEA, and 578 (5%) redo-CAS. Comparing primary-CAS versus CASAPICEAversus redo-CAS, 30-day stroke/death was 2.5% versus 2.0% versus 1.3% forasymptomatic patients (P=0.23) and 5.2% versus 2.6% versus 5.0% for symptomaticpatients (P=0.003). CASAPICEA was associated with significantly lower 30-daystroke/death (odds ratio: 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.98; P=0.04)compared with primary-CAS among symptomatic patients. The odds of bradycardiawere lower following CASAPICEA (odds ratio: 0.32; 95% confidence interval:0.26-0.39; P<0.001) and redo-CAS (odds ratio: 0.55; 95% confidence interval:0.39-0.78; P=0.001) compared with primary-CAS. Similarly, the odds of hypotensionwere significantly lower in both groups compared with primary-CAS (CASAPICEA:0.41 [0.35-0.48], P<0.001; redo-CAS: 0.66 [0.50-0.86] P=0.003). There were nosignificant differences in the hazards of stroke/death at 1 year for CASAPICEAand redo-CAS compared with primary-CAS.CONCLUSIONS: CASAPICEA is associated with significantly lower odds ofperiprocedural stroke/death compared with primary-CAS among symptomatic patients.CASAPICEA and redo-CAS are associated with significantly lower odds ofperiprocedural hypotension and bradycardia but higher odds of hypertensioncompared with primary-CAS.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
"Novel Mechanism for Buffering Dietary Salt in Humans: Effects of Salt Loading on Skin Sodium, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C, and Blood Pressure.",/pubmed/28974570,"High dietary sodium intake triggers increased blood pressure (BP). Animal studiesshow that dietary salt loading results in dermal Na+ accumulation andlymphangiogenesis mediated by VEGF-C (vascular endothelial growth factor C), bothattenuating the rise in BP. Our objective was to determine whether thesemechanisms function in humans. We assessed skin electrolytes, BP, and plasmaVEGF-C in 48 healthy participants randomized to placebo (70 mmol sodium/d) andslow sodium (200 mmol/d) for 7 days. Skin Na+ and K+ concentrations were measuredin mg/g of wet tissue and expressed as the ratio Na+:K+ to correct forvariability in sample hydration. Skin Na+:K+ increased between placebo and slowsodium phases (2.91±0.08 versus 3.12±0.09; P=0.01). In post hoc analysis, therewas a suggestion of a sex-specific effect, with a significant increase in skinNa+:K+ in men (2.59±0.09 versus 2.88±0.12; P=0.008) but not women (3.23±0.10versus 3.36±0.12; P=0.31). Women showed a significant increase in 24-hour mean BPwith salt loading (93±1 versus 91±1 mm Hg; P<0.001) while men did not (96±2versus 96±2 mm Hg; P=0.91). Skin Na+:K+ correlated with BP, stroke volume, andperipheral vascular resistance in men but not in women. No change was noted inplasma VEGF-C. These findings suggest that the skin may buffer dietary Na+,reducing the hemodynamic consequences of increased salt, and this may beinfluenced by sex.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Systolic Blood Pressure Visit-to-Visit Variability and Major Adverse Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation: The AFFIRM Study (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management).,/pubmed/28974568,"Hypertension and atrial fibrillation predict major adverse events independently. Visit-to-visit variability (VVV) in systolic blood pressure (SBP) predictsoutcomes beyond SBP itself, but risk associated with SBP-VVV in atrialfibrillation remains uncertain. We evaluated relationships between SBP-VVV,quality of oral anticoagulation control, and outcomes in patients with atrialfibrillation. Data from the AFFIRM trial (atrial fibrillation follow-upinvestigation of rhythm management) were analyzed. SBP-VVV was defined according to SD of SBP (SBP-SD) during follow-up. SBP-VVV was categorized by quartiles(1st, <10.09; 2nd, 10.09-13.85; 3rd, 13.86-17.33; and 4th, _17.34 mm Hg) and as acontinuous variable. Among the original cohort, 3843 (94.7%) patients wereeligible. Time in therapeutic range and percentage of international normalizedratio in range were progressively lower by quartiles (both P<0.001). An inverselinear association existed between SBP-SD and time in therapeuticrange/percentage of international normalized ratio in range (P<0.001). After amedian (interquartile range) follow-up of 3.6 (2.7-4.6) years, stroke and majorbleeding rates progressively increased by SBP-VVV quartile (both P<0.001).Patients in the 4th quartile had the highest rate of cardiovascular and all-causedeath (P=0.005 and P<0.001). A Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that 3rd and4th quartiles were associated independently with a higher risk for stroke(P=0.042 and P=0.004) and major bleeding (P=0.009 and P<0.001). Patients in 4thquartile had also a higher risk for all-cause death (P=0.048). SBP-SD as acontinuous variable was associated with increased risk for all outcomes. Inconclusion, SBP-VVV is inversely associated with quality of anticoagulationcontrol and independently predicts major adverse outcomes. Management of bloodpressure variability may improve outcomes in atrial fibrillation.CLINICAL TRIALREGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00000556.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Relative and Combined Prognostic Importance of On-Treatment Mean and Visit-to-Visit Blood Pressure Variability in ONTARGET and TRANSCEND Patients.,/pubmed/28974567,"In 28 790 patients recruited for the ONTARGET (Ongoing Treatment Alone and inCombination With Ramipril Global End Point Trials) and TRANSCEND (TelmisartanRandomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects With CardiovascularDisease) trials, we investigated the prognostic value for cardiovascular events(primary outcome) of (1)on-treatment visit-to-visit systolic blood pressure (SBP)variability versus mean SBP and (2) the 2 measures together. SBP variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of mean SBP to which it wasunrelated. Confounders such as variable time and number of visits from which tocalculate SBP-CV were avoided by using the same number of visits at identicaltimes in all patients. The covariate-adjusted risk of the primary outcome (Coxmodels) increased as SBP-CV or mean on-treatment quintile SBP increased, but onlyfor mean on-treatment SBP, the relationship achieved statistical significance:global test for trend, P=0.12 versus P<0.0001. SBP-CV showed a relationship with fatal events, but it was unrelated to the risk of myocardial infarction andstroke, which were predicted by on-treatment mean SBP. Prediction of the primary outcome improved by the combined use of both measures: global test for trend,P<0.0001; hazard ratio for combined fifth versus first quintile, 1.42 (1.20-1.68)compared with 1.13 (1.01-1.27) for SBP-CV and 1.24 (1.11-1.40) for mean SBP.Thus, in the present study, on-treatment mean SBP provided an overall betterprediction of cardiovascular risk than visit-to-visit SBP-CV. Prediction improvedby their combined use, which may thus offer a more precise estimate of theprotective effect of treatment.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:http//www.clinicaltrial.gov.

Low-Dose vs Standard-Dose Alteplase for Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: Secondary Analysis of the ENCHANTED Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/28973174,"Importance: A lower dose of intravenous alteplase appears to be a safer treatmentoption than the standard dose, reducing the risk of symptomatic intracerebralhemorrhage. There is uncertainty, however, over how this effect translates intoan overall clinical benefit for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Objective: To assess whether older, Asian, or severely affected patients with AISwho are considered at high risk of thrombolysis may benefit more from low-doserather than standard-dose alteplase treatment.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is a prespecified secondaryanalysis of the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study(ENCHANTED), an international, randomized, open-label, blinded, end-pointclinical trial of low-dose vs standard-dose intravenous alteplase for patientswith AIS. From March 1, 2012, to August 31, 2015, a total of 3310 patients whohad a clinical diagnosis of AIS as confirmed by brain imaging and who fulfilledthe local criteria for thrombolysis treatment were included in the alteplase-dosearms. Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-dose (0.6 mg/kg; 15% asbolus and 85% as infusion over 1 hour) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg; 10% as bolus and 90% as infusion over 1 hour) alteplase. Of the 3310 randomized patients, 13patients were excluded for missing consent, mistaken randomization, and duplicaterandomization numbers. This secondary analysis was conducted between May 1, 2016,and April 28, 2017.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a poor outcome defined bythe combination of death and any disability as scored by the modified RankinScale (scores range from 2 to 6, with the highest score indicating death) at 90days.Results: Of the 3297 patients included in the analysis, 1248 (37.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 67 (13) years. No significant differences in thetreatment effects were observed between low- and standard-dose alteplase for pooroutcomes (death or disability) by age, ethnicity, or severity (all P_>_.37 forinteraction). Similarly, the treatment effects of low- vs standard-dose alteplaseon function outcome (ordinal shift of the modified Rankin Scale) in Asians (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.22) was consistent with non-Asians (odds ratio, 0.93;95% CI, 0.76-1.14) (P_=_.32 for interaction). There were generally consistentreductions in rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage with low-dosealteplase, although this reduction was not statistically significant by age,ethnicity, or severity.Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis found that the effects of low-dosealteplase were not clearly superior to the effects of standard-dose alteplase on death or disability in key demographic subgroups of patients with AIS.

Weight loss andlowering body mass index (BMI) have been shown to lower ICP and improve symptoms in IIH; however, weight loss is typically not maintained, meaning IIH symptomsreturn. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Weight Trial (IIH:WT) willassess whether bariatric surgery is an effective long-term treatment for patientswith IIH with a BMI over 35_kg/m2. The National Institute for Health and CareExcellence recommends bariatric surgery in people with a BMI over 35_kg/m2 and a qualifying comorbidity; currently IIH does not qualify as a comorbidity.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: IIH:WT is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial of 64 participants with active IIH and a BMI over 35_kg/m2.Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to bariatric surgery or a dietary weight loss programme and followed up for 5 years.

Dynamics of the human antibody repertoire after B cell depletion in systemic sclerosis.,/pubmed/28963118,"Systemic sclerosis with pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH) is adebilitating and frequently lethal disease of unknown cause lacking effectivetreatment options. Lymphocyte anomalies and autoantibodies observed in systemicsclerosis have suggested an autoimmune character. We study the clonal structureof the B cell repertoire in SSc-PAH using immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)sequencing before and after B cell depletion. We found SSc-PAH to be associatedwith anomalies in B cell development, namely, altered VDJ rearrangementfrequencies (reduced IGHV2-5 segment usage) and an increased somaticmutation-fixation probability in expanded B cell lineages. SSc-PAH was alsocharacterized by anomalies in B cell homeostasis, namely, an expandedimmunoglobulin D-positive (IgD+) proportion with reduced mutation loads and anexpanded proportion of highly antibody-secreting cells. Disease signaturespertaining to IGHV2-5 segment usage, IgD proportions, and mutation loads weretemporarily reversed after B cell depletion. Analyzing the time course of B cell depletion, we find that the kinetics of na´ve replenishment are predictable from baseline measurements alone, that release of plasma cells into the periphery can precede na´ve replenishment, and that modes of B cell receptor diversity arehighly elastic. Our findings reveal humoral immune signatures of SSc-PAH anduncover determinism in the effects of B cell depletion on the antibodyrepertoire.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Intensive Versus Standard Blood Pressure Control in SPRINT-Eligible Participants of ACCORD-BP.,/pubmed/28947569,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effect of intensive blood pressure (BP)control on cardiovascular outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a post hoc, multivariate, subgroupanalysis of ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes BloodPressure) participants. Participants were eligible for the analysis if they were in the standard glucose control arm of ACCORD-BP and also had the additional CVD risk factors required for SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial)eligibility. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to compare theeffect of intensive versus standard BP control on CVD outcomes. The""SPRINT-eligible"" ACCORD-BP participants were pooled with SPRINT participants to determine whether the effects of intensive BP control interacted with T2DM.RESULTS: The mean baseline Framingham 10-year CVD risk scores were 14.5% and14.8%, respectively, in the intensive and standard BP control groups. The meanachieved systolic BP values were 120 and 134 mmHg in the intensive and standardBP control groups (P < 0.001). Intensive BP control reduced the composite of CVD death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, anyrevascularization, and heart failure (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI 0.65-0.96; P =0.02). Intensive BP control also reduced CVD death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatalstroke (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P = 0.01). Treatment-related adverseevents occurred more frequently in participants receiving intensive BP control(4.1% vs. 2.1%; P = 0.003). The effect of intensive BP control on CVD outcomesdid not differ between patients with and without T2DM (P > 0.62).CONCLUSIONS: Intensive BP control reduced CVD outcomes in a cohort ofparticipants with T2DM and additional CVD risk factors.",RCT,,,,intensive BP control,standard BP control,,,type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease,composite of CVD death,
COBI (COntinuous hyperosmolar therapy for traumatic Brain-Injured patients) trial protocol: a multicentre randomised open-label trial with blinded adjudication of primary outcome.,/pubmed/28947465,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and severeprolonged disability. Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a critical risk factorof bad outcomes after TBI. Continuous infusion of hyperosmolar therapy has beenproposed for the prevention and the treatment of ICH. Whether an earlyadministration of continuous hyperosmolar therapy improves long-term outcomes of patients with TBI is uncertain. The aim of the COBI study (numberclinicaltrial.gov 03143751, pre-results stage) is to assess the efficiency andthe safety of continuous hyperosmolar therapy in patients with TBI.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The COBI (COntinuous hyperosmolar therapy in traumaticBrain-Injured patients) trial is a multicentre, randomised, controlled,open-label, two-arms study with blinded adjudication of primary outcome. Threehundred and seventy patients hospitalised in intensive care unit with a TBI(Glasgow Coma Scale _12_and abnormal brain CT scan) are randomised in the first24_hours following trauma to standard care or continuous hyperosmolar therapy(20% NaCl) plus standard care. Continuous hyperosmolar therapy is maintained for at least 48_hours in the treatment group and continued for as long as isnecessary to prevent ICH. The primary outcome is the score on the ExtendedGlasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months. The treatment effect is estimated with ordinallogistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors and expressed asa common OR.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The COBI trial protocol has been approved by the ethicscommittee of Paris Ile de France VIII and will be carried out according to theprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practiceguidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentationat scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.

CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Score for Identifying Truly Low-Risk Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke: A Korean Nationwide Cohort Study.,/pubmed/28939672,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the threshold of stroke risk for initiating oralanticoagulants is lowered after the introduction of the nonvitamin K antagonistoral anticoagulants, the focus of stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation has shifted away from predicting high-risk patients towardinitially identifying patients with a truly low risk of ischemic stroke, who donot need antithrombotic therapy. We tested the predictive ability of thecongestive heart failure, hypertension, age _75, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (doubled; CHADS2), congestive heart failure,hypertension, age _75 (doubled), diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transientischemic attack (doubled), vascular disease, age 65 to 74, female (CHA2DS2-VASc),and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) riskstratification schemes in oral anticoagulants naive patients with atrialfibrillation in a Korean nationwide sample cohort.METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2008, a total of 5855 oral anticoagulantnaive patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation aged _20 years were enrolled from Korea National Health Insurance Service-Sample Cohort database and werefollowed-up until December 2013.RESULTS: At baseline, the proportions categorized as low risk using CHADS2,CHA2DS2-VASc, and ATRIA risk stratification schemes were 1049 (17.9%), 860(14.7%), and 3280 (56.0%), respectively. During follow-up, the low-risk category using CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and ATRIA scores was retained in 811 (13.9%), 667(11.4%), and 2729 (46.6%) patients, respectively. Rates of ischemic stroke (100person-years) in the low risk categories of CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and ATRIAscores were 0.42, 0.26, and 1.43, respectively. CHA2DS2-VASc had the bestsensitivity (98.8% versus 85.7% in CHADS2 and 74.8% in ATRIA) and negativepredictive value (98.8% versus 95.3% for CHADS2 and 93.7% for ATRIA) for theprediction of stroke incidence and was best for the prediction of the absence of ischemic stroke during 5 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 16.4 [95% confidenceinterval, 8.8-30.8]).CONCLUSIONS: The CHA2DS2-VASc score shows good performance in defining trulylow-risk Asian patients with atrial fibrillation for stroke compared with CHADS2 and ATRIA scores.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets: An Experimental Approach to an Observational Paradigm.,/pubmed/28939617,"BACKGROUND: Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) values are associated with anincreased risk of cardiovascular events, giving rise to the so-called J-curvephenomenon. We assessed the association between on-treatment SBP levels,cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in patients randomized todifferent SBP targets.METHODS: Data from 2 large randomized trials that randomly allocated hypertensivepatients at high risk for cardiovascular disease to intensive (SBP<120 mm_Hg) or conventional (SBP<140 mm_Hg) treatment were pooled and harmonized for outcomesand follow-up duration. Using natural cubic splines, we plotted the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events against the mean on-treatmentSBP per treatment group.RESULTS: The pooled data consisted of 194_875 on-treatment SBP measurements in13_946 patients (98.9%). During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, cardiovascularevents occurred in 1014 patients (7.3%), and 502 patients died (3.7%). For bothblood pressure targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with anadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBPtarget. Patients in the lowest SBP stratum were older, had a higher body massindex, smoked more often, and had a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus andcardiovascular events.CONCLUSIONS: Low on-treatment SBP levels are associated with increasedcardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This association is independent ofthe attained blood pressure level because the J curve aligns with the SBP target.Our results suggest that the benefit or risk associated with intensive bloodpressure-lowering treatment can be established only via randomized clinicaltrials.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

"Comparison of Fixed-dose Combinations of Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium/Chlorthalidone and Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium in Patients With Stage 2 Hypertension Inadequately Controlled With Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium: A Randomized, Double-blind, Multicent",/pubmed/28939406,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety offixed-dose combinations of amlodipine/losartan potassium/chlorthalidone (A/L/C)and A/L in Korean patients with stage 2 hypertension inadequately controlled byA/L.METHODS: This study was an 8-week, randomized double-blind, multicenter, phaseIII clinical trial. Three hundred forty volunteer patients with stage 2hypertension were randomized to receive A/L/C or A/L. The primary end point was achange in sitting systolic blood pressure (SitSBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. Assecondary end points, the change in SitSBP after 2 weeks of treatment and thechange in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SitDBP) were compared betweentreatment groups. All patients were assessed for adverse events, clinicallaboratory data, and vital signs.FINDINGS: Of 330 patients from 33 medical centers, 328 patients who had availableefficacy data were analyzed. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, the mean(SD) changes in SitSBP at 8 weeks were -16.4 (0.9) mm Hg and -6.9 (1.0) mm Hg in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively. A/L/C had a statistically superior blood pressure-lowering effect compared with that of A/L (mean [SD] difference, 9.5[1.3] mm Hg; P < 0.001). The mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 8 weeks wassignificantly greater with A/L/C (-8.0 [0.6] mm Hg) than with A/L (-3.6 [0.6] mm Hg) (P < .001). In terms of the mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 2 weeks comparedwith baseline, A/L/C (-5.9 [0.5] mm Hg) was statistically different from A/L(-2.9 [0.5] mm Hg) (P < .001). Mean (SD) SitSBP change from baseline to week 2was -13.2 (0.9) and -5.5 (0.9) in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively, with a statistically significant blood pressure-lowering effect (P < 0.001). The number of participants who achieved target blood pressure at week 8 was significantlyhigher in the A/L/C group (93 patients [55.7%]) than in the A/L group (48[29.8%]) (P < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions were observed in 23 patients (7.0%),and the incidence of dizziness was significantly higher in the A/L/C group thanin the A/L group (4.8% vs 0.6%, P = 0.037) There were no serious adverse eventsassociated with the study drugs.IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study suggest that A/L/C had a significantlyincreased blood pressure-lowering efficacy compared with that of A/L and had agood safety profile.

High screen failure rate in patients with resistant hypertension: Findings from SYMPLICITY HTN-3.,/pubmed/28938966,"BACKGROUND: The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial, which randomized subjects to renaldenervation (RDN) or sham control, was designed to evaluate the efficacy andsafety of RDN for the treatment of resistant hypertension. Outcomes werepreviously reported. This retrospective analysis evaluated reasons for screenfailure (SF) for randomization in the trial.METHODS: SYMPLICITY HTN-3 enrolled subjects with office systolic blood pressure(SBP) _160 mmHg on stable and maximal doses of _3 antihypertensive medicationclasses. Blood pressure was measured during screening visit (SV) 1 and SV2 aminimum of 2 weeks later to ensure resistant hypertension and to excludewhite-coat hypertension. We analyzed baseline characteristics and reasons for SF at each SV and changes in BP between SVs.RESULTS: Among 1,415 patients screened, 880 (62%) did not meet criteria forrandomization. Compared with randomized patients, those in the SF cohort weremore likely to be older (58.7 vs. 57.4 years, P=.029), current smokers (14.5% vs.10.7%, P=.041), and prescribed fewer antihypertensive medications (4.7 vs. 5.1,P<.001). The predominant reason for SF at SV2 was office SBP <160 mmHg despiteoffice SBP _160 mmHg at SV1.CONCLUSION: Screening patients with resistant hypertension on maximal doses of _3antihypertensive drugs led to a high SF rate. Screen failures were most common atSV1 and were due to failing the office SBP entry criteria. Not meeting ambulatorySBP criteria at SV2 was a secondary reason for SF, often due to white-coathypertension; thus, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is important to validateresistant hypertension.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cardiovascular disease and mortality after breast cancer in postmenopausal women: Results from the Women's Health Initiative.,/pubmed/28934233,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity andmortality among older postmenopausal women. The impact of postmenopausal breastcancer on CVD for older women is uncertain. We hypothesized that olderpostmenopausal women with breast cancer would be at a higher risk of CVD thansimilar aged women without breast cancer and that CVD would be a majorcontributor to the subsequent morbidity and mortality.METHODS: In a prospective Women's Health Initiative study, incident CVD eventsand total and cause-specific death rates were compared between postmenopausalwomen with (n = 4,340) and without (n = 97,576) incident invasive breast cancerover 10 years post-diagnosis, stratified by 3 age groups (50-59, 60-69, and70-79).RESULTS: Postmenopausal women, regardless of breast cancer diagnosis, had similarand high levels of CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking and hypertension) at baseline prior to breast cancer, which were strong predictors of CVD and total mortalityover time. CVD affected mostly women age 70-79 with localized breast cancer (79% of breast cancer cases in 70-79 age group): only 17% died from breast cancer and CVD was the leading cause of death (22%) over the average 10 years follow up.Compared to age-matched women without breast cancer, women age 70-79 at diagnosisof localized breast cancer had a similar multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-1.33) for coronary heart disease, alower risk of composite CVD (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70-1.00), and a higher risk of total mortality (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.39).CONCLUSION: CVD was a major contributor to mortality in women with localizedbreast cancer at age 70-79. Further studies are needed to evaluate both screeningand treatment of localized breast cancer tailored to the specific health issuesof older women.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predicting Major Bleeding in Ischemic Stroke Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/28931618,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Performance of risk scores for major bleeding in patientswith atrial fibrillation and a previous transient ischemic attack or ischemicstroke is not well established. We aimed to validate risk scores for majorbleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulantsafter cerebral ischemia and explore the net benefit of oral anticoagulants among bleeding risk categories.METHODS: We analyzed 3623 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack orstroke included in the RE-LY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-TermAnticoagulation Therapy). We assessed performance of HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic orrenal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older age, reduced platelet count orfunction, hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fallrisk, and stroke), Shireman, HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liverfunction, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile internationalnormalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), ATRIA (Anticoagulationand Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), and ORBIT scores (older age, reducedhaemoglobin/haematocrit/history of anaemia, bleeding history, insufficient kidneyfunction, and treatment with antiplatelet) with C statistics and calibrationplots. Net benefit of oral anticoagulants was explored by comparing riskreduction in ischemic stroke with risk increase in major bleedings on warfarin.RESULTS: During 6922 person-years of follow-up, 266 patients experienced a major bleed (3.8 per 100 person-years). C statistics ranged from 0.62 (Shireman) to0.67 (ATRIA). Calibration was poor for ATRIA and moderate for other models. Thereduction in recurrent ischemic strokes on warfarin was larger than the increase in major bleeding risk, irrespective of bleeding risk category.CONCLUSIONS: Performance of prediction models for major bleeding in patients withcerebral ischemia and atrial fibrillation is modest but comparable withperformance in patients with only atrial fibrillation. Bleeding risk scorescannot guide treatment decisions for oral anticoagulants but may still be useful to identify modifiable risk factors for bleeding. Clinical usefulness may be bestfor ORBIT, which is based on a limited number of easily obtainable variables and showed reasonable performance.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reducing therapeutic misconception: A randomized intervention trial in hypothetical clinical trials.,/pubmed/28931031,"BACKGROUND: Participants in clinical trials frequently fail to appreciate keydifferences between research and clinical care. This phenomenon, known astherapeutic misconception, undermines informed consent to clinical research, but to date there have been no effective interventions to reduce it and concerns havebeen expressed that to do so might impede recruitment. We determined whether ascientific reframing intervention reduces therapeutic misconception withoutsignificantly reducing willingness to participate in hypothetical clinicaltrials.METHODS: This prospective randomized trial was conducted from 2015 to 2016 totest the efficacy of an informed consent intervention based on scientificreframing compared to a traditional informed consent procedure (control) inreducing therapeutic misconception among patients considering enrollment inhypothetical clinical trials modeled on real-world studies for one of fivedisease categories. Patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronaryartery disease, head/neck cancer, breast cancer, and major depression wererecruited from medical clinics and a clinical research volunteer database. Theprimary outcomes were therapeutic misconception, as measured by a validated,ten-item Therapeutic Misconception Scale (range = 10-50), and willingness toparticipate in the clinical trial.RESULTS: 154 participants completed the study (age range, 23-87 years; 92.3%white, 56.5% female); 74 (48.1%) had been randomized to receive the experimental intervention. Therapeutic misconception was significantly lower (p = 0.004) inthe scientific reframing group (26.4, 95% CI [23.7 to 29.1] compared to thecontrol group (30.9, 95% CI [28.4 to 33.5], and remained so after controlling foreducation (p = 0.017). Willingness to participate in the hypothetical trial wasnot significantly different (p = 0.603) between intervention (52.1%, 95% CI[40.2% to 62.4%]) and control (56.3%, 95% CI [45.3% to 66.6%] groups.CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced educational intervention augmenting traditional informedconsent led to a meaningful reduction in therapeutic misconception without astatistically significant change in willingness to enroll in hypotheticalclinical trials.

Cigarette Smoking Attenuates Kidney Protection by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition in Nondiabetic Chronic Kidney Disease.,/pubmed/28930715,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking exacerbates the estimated glomerular filtrationrate (eGFR) decline in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite thekidney protection that is achieved by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition(ACEI). Whether smoking cessation restores ACEI-related kidney protection is not known.METHODS: This 5-year, prospective, prevention trial recruited 108 smokers and 108nonsmokers with stage-2 nondiabetic CKD with primary hypertension and urinealbumin-to-creatinine ratio (Ualb) >200 mg/g. All smokers underwent smokingcessation intervention programs. Blood pressure was reduced in all participantstoward achieving a goal of <130 mm Hg with regimens including ACEI. The primaryoutcome was eGFR change, and secondary outcomes included Ualb and urine levels ofangiotensinogen (UATG), a surrogate for kidney angiotensin II (AII) levels, andisoprostane 8-isoprostaglandin F2_ (U8-iso), an indicator of oxidative stress.RESULTS: One-year Ualb was lower than baseline in nonsmokers but not in eithersmoking group, supporting greater ACEI-related kidney protection in nonsmokersthan smokers. Higher Ualb at 1 year in continued smokers was associated withhigher UATG and higher U8-iso, consistent with smoking-induced AII and increased oxidative stress contributing to less ACEI-related kidney protection in smokers. Baseline eGFR was not different among groups (p = 0.92), but 5-year eGFR washigher in quitters than in continued smokers (62.0 ± 5.4 vs. 52.9 ± 5.6mL/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.001); this value was lower in quitters than in nonsmokers(64.7 ± 5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation compared with continued smoking ameliorates eGFRdecline in nondiabetic CKD treated with ACEI, possibly by restoringkidney-protective effects of ACEI through reductions in kidney AII and oxidative stress.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or abatacept or rituximab following failure of initial TNFi in rheumatoid arthritis: the SWITCH RCT.,/pubmed/29900829,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common autoimmune disease in the UK, is a chronic systemic inflammatory arthritis that affects 0.8% of the UKpopulation.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not an alternative class of biologicdisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are comparable to rituximab interms of efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with RA in whom initial tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) bDMARD and methotrexate (MTX) therapy failedbecause of inefficacy.DESIGN: Multicentre, Phase III, open-label, parallel-group, three-arm,non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical andcost-effectiveness of alternative TNFi and abatacept with that of rituximab (and background MTX therapy). Eligible consenting patients were randomised in a1_:_1_:_1 ratio using minimisation incorporating a random element. Minimisationfactors were centre, disease duration, non-response category andseropositive/seronegative status.SETTING: UK outpatient rheumatology departments.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged __18 years who were diagnosed with RA and werereceiving MTX, but had not responded to two or more conventional syntheticdisease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapies and had shown an inadequatetreatment response to a first TNFi.INTERVENTIONS: Alternative TNFi, abatacept or rituximab (and continued backgroundMTX).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was absolute reduction in the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) at 24 weeks post randomisation. Secondaryoutcome measures over 48 weeks were additional measures of disease activity,quality of life, cost-effectiveness, radiographic measures, safety and toxicity.LIMITATIONS: Owing to third-party contractual issues, commissioning challengesdelaying centre set-up and thus slower than expected recruitment, the fundersterminated the trial early.RESULTS: Between July 2012 and December 2014, 149 patients in 35 centres wereregistered, of whom 122 were randomised to treatment (alternative TNFi, n_=_41;abatacept, n_=_41; rituximab, n_=_40).

Corresponding results for the abatacept and rituximab comparisonwere 0.04 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.79) in the ITT population and -0.15 (95% CI -1.27 to0.98) in the PP population. General improvement in the Health AssessmentQuestionnaire Disability Index, Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life and thepatients' general health was apparent over time, with no notable differencesbetween treatment groups. There was a marked initial improvement in the patients'global assessment of pain and arthritis at 12 weeks across all three treatmentgroups. Switching to alternative TNFi may be cost-effective compared withrituximab [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) £5332.02 perquality-adjusted life-year gained]; however, switching to abatacept compared withswitching to alternative TNFi is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER£253,967.96), but there was substantial uncertainty in the decisions. The valueof information analysis indicated that further research would be highly valuable to the NHS. Ten serious adverse events in nine patients were reported; none were suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. Two patients died and 10experienced toxicity.FUTURE WORK: The results will add to the randomised evidence base and could beincluded in future meta-analyses.CONCLUSIONS: How to manage first-line TNFi treatment failures remains unresolved.Had the trial recruited to target, more credible evidence on whether or noteither of the interventions were non-inferior to rituximab may have beenprovided, although this remains speculative.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN89222125 andClinicalTrials.gov NCT01295151.FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full inHealth Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 34.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of strategies using new immunological diagnostic tests of latent tuberculosis infection before TNF-blockers therapy.,/pubmed/29478790,"Several tests have been proposed to detect latent tuberculosis (LTB).OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different interferon-gamma release assaysbased strategies used to screen LTB before tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers initiation.METHODS: Consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis orCrohn's disease for whom TNF-blockers were considered, were recruited in 15tertiary care centres. All were screened for LTB with tuberculin skin test (TST),QuantiFERON TB GoldÂ in tube (QFT) and T-SPOT.TBÂ (TSpot) on the same day.Cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analysis, testing 8 screening testcombinations, were conducted. Effectiveness was defined as the percentage of LTB treatment avoided and compared with TST alone. Cost were elicited in the payerperspective, included all the costs related to the screening procedure.RESULTS: No tuberculosis reactivation was observed after TNF-blocker initiation. TST followed by QFT if TST was positive was found as the best screening strategy,i.e. the less costly (-54 compared to reference) and most effective(effectiveness 0.93), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of-192 per treatment avoided. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed this result in 72.3% of simulations.CONCLUSION: TST followed by QFT if TST was positive is the most cost-effectivestrategy in screening for LTB in patients before starting anti-TNF therapy.TRIALREGNO: NCT00811343.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pattern of risks of rheumatoid arthritis among patients using statins: A cohort study with the clinical practice research datalink.,/pubmed/29474418,"We examined the association between statin use and the risk of rheumatoidarthritis (RA), with special focus on describing the patterns of risks of RAduring statin exposure in a large population-based cohort in the United Kingdom. In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, patients aged _40 years with at leastone prescription of statins (1995-2009) were selected, and matched by age (+/-5years), sex, practice and date of first prescription of statins to non-users. Thefollow-up period of statin use was divided into periods of current, recent andpast exposure, with patients moving between these three exposure categories over time. Time-dependent Cox models were used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) of RA,adjusted for disease history and previous drug use. The study population included1,023,240 patients, of whom 511,620 were statin users. No associations were foundbetween RA and current (HRadj,1.06;99%CI:0.88-1.27) or past statin users(HRadj,1.18;99%CI:0.88-1.57). However, in patients who currently used statins,hazard rates were increased shortly after the first prescription of statins andthen gradually decreased to baseline level. The risk of developing RA wasincreased in recent statin users, as compared to non-users(HRadj,1.39;99%CI:1.01-1.90). The risk of RA is substantially increased in thefirst year after the start of statins and then diminishes to baseline level.These findings may suggest that statins might accelerate disease onset inpatients susceptible to develop RA, but in other patients, statins are probablysafe and well tolerated, even after prolonged use. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that confounding by cardiovascular risk factors and ascertainment bias mayhave influenced the findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Response to baricitinib based on prior biologic use in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29415145,"Objective: RA patients who have failed biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) represent anunmet medical need. We evaluated the effects of baseline characteristics,including prior bDMARD exposure, on baricitinib efficacy and safety.Methods: RA-BEACON patients (previously reported) had moderate to severe RA with insufficient response to one or more TNF inhibitor and were randomized 1:1:1 toonce-daily placebo or 2 or 4 mg baricitinib. Prior bDMARD use was allowed. Theprimary endpoint was a 20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) at week 12 for 4mg vs placebo. An exploratory, primarily post hoc, subgroup analysis evaluatedefficacy at weeks 12 and 24 by ACR20 and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)_10. An interaction P-value _0.10 was considered significant, with significanceat both weeks 12 and 24 given more weight.Results: The odds ratios predominantly favored baricitinib over placebo and were generally similar to those in the overall study (3.4, 2.4 for ACR20 weeks 12 and 24, respectively). Significant quantitative interactions were observed forbaricitinib 4 mg vs placebo at weeks 12 and 24: ACR20 by region (larger effectEurope) and CDAI _10 by disease duration (larger effect _10 years).

Patients received open-label tocilizumab (8mg/kg i.v. every 4 weeks) and open-label MTX. At week 24, patients achievinggood/moderate EULAR response were randomized to group A (double-blind MTX taper) or group B (double-blind MTX maintenance); both arms continued open-labeltocilizumab. Primary analysis was the proportion of patients maintaininggood/moderate EULAR response from week 24 to 60.Results: The study stopped early due to low recruitment, although thepredetermined non-inferiority criteria were still met; 427 patients were enrolledto the open-label phase at week 0. At week 24, EULAR good/moderate response wasachieved in 272 individuals (64.4%) who were randomized, 136 in each arm (36%withdrew/were not eligible). Additionally, 45.0% achieved DAS28 _3.2, 33.5%achieved remission (DAS28 <2.6) and 64.2% had a DAS28 change _1.2.

Both early and sustained reduction of P4NP7S was associated with clinical response to 150 mg mavrilimumab treatment.

While CCL22 and IL-6 down-regulation mayreflect a direct effect of GM-CSFR blockade on the production of pro-inflammatorymediators by myeloid cells, the suppression of IL-2 receptor _ and IL-17/IL-22associated transcripts suggests an indirect suppressive effect of mavrilimumab onT cell activation.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated association of peripheral biomarker changes with therapeutic response to mavrilimumab in RA patients.

Optimizing treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis-a proof of principle and exploratory trial: is dose tapering practical in good responders?,/pubmed/28968858,"Objectives: RA patients receiving TNF inhibitors (TNFi) usually maintain theirinitial doses. The aim of the Optimizing Treatment with Tumour Necrosis FactorInhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis trial was to evaluate whether tapering TNFidoses causes loss of clinical response.Methods: We enrolled RA patients receiving etanercept or adalimumab and a DMARDwith DAS28 under 3.2 for over 3 months. Initially (months 0-6) patients wererandomized to control (constant TNFi) or two experimental groups (tapering TNFiby 33 or 66%). Subsequently (months 6-12) control subjects were randomized totaper TNFi by 33 or 66%. Disease flares (DAS28 increasing _0.6 with at least one additional swollen joint) were the primary outcome.Results: Two hundred and forty-four patients were screened, 103 randomized and 97treated. In months 0-6 there were 8/50 (16%) flares in controls, 3/26 (12%) with 33% tapering and 6/21 (29%) with 66% tapering. Multivariate Cox analysis showedtime to flare was unchanged with 33% tapering but was reduced with 66% taperingcompared with controls (adjusted hazard ratio 2.81, 95% CI: 0.99, 7.94; P =0.051).

Effects of psychosocial factors on monitoring treatment effect in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients over time: response data from the tREACH study.,/pubmed/28967272,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether, apart from effects of patient- anddisease-related factors, psychosocial factors have additional effects on disease activity; and which factors are most influential during the first year oftreatment in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).METHOD: The study assessed 15¾month follow-up data from patients in tREACH, arandomized clinical trial comparing initial triple disease-modifyinganti-rheumatic drug therapy to methotrexate monotherapy, with glucocorticoidbridging in both groups. Patients were evaluated every 3¾months and treated totarget. Associations between Disease Activity Score (DAS) at 3, 9, and 15¾months and psychosocial factors (anxiety, depression, fatigue, and coping with pain) at the previous visit were assessed by multivariable linear regression correctingfor demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors.RESULTS: At 3, 9, and 15¾months of follow-up, 265, 251, and 162 patients,respectively, were available for analysis. Baseline anxiety and coping with pain were associated with DAS at 3¾months; coping with pain at 6¾months was associatedwith DAS at 9¾months, and fatigue at 12¾months with DAS at 15¾months.Psychosocial factors were moderately correlated. Effects on DAS were mainly dueto tender joint count and global health.CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors have additional effects on DAS throughout thefirst year of treatment in early RA. A change was observed from anxiety andcoping with pain at baseline being associated with subsequent DAS towards fatiguebeing associated with subsequent DAS at 12¾months. Owing to the explorativenature of this study, more research is needed to confirm this pattern.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A somatization comorbidity phenotype impacts response to therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: post-hoc results from the certolizumab pegol phase 4 PREDICT trial.,/pubmed/28962590,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities may contribute to disease activity and treatmentresponse in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. We defined a somatizationcomorbidity phenotype (SCP) and examined its influence on response tocertolizumab pegol (CZP) using data from the PREDICT trial.METHODS: Patients in PREDICT were randomized to the patient-reported RoutineAssessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or physician-based Clinical DiseaseActivity Index (CDAI) for treatment response assessment. Post-hoc analysesidentified patients with the SCP, which included diagnosis of depression,fibromyalgia/myalgias, and/or use of medications indicated for treatment ofdepression, anxiety, or neuropathic pain. The effect of the SCP on RAPID3 or CDAIresponse at week 12 and low disease activity (LDA; Disease Activity Score in 28joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate __3.2) at week 52, in week-12responders, was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).RESULTS: At baseline, 43% (313/733) of patients met the SCP classification.Patients with the SCP were 9% more likely to withdraw from the trial. AmericanCollege of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses were 5-14% lower among those with the SCP, and 11% more patients reported adverse events (AEs).Patients without SCP in the CDAI arm were twice as likely to achieve LDA at week 52 compared with those with SCP (32% versus 16%). No differentiation by SCP wasobserved in the RAPID3 arm (pooled result 21.5%).CONCLUSIONS: We operationalized a potentially important somatization comorbidity phenotype in a trial setting that was associated with a substantially lowerlikelihood of treatment response and a higher frequency of AEs. Including largenumbers of patients with this phenotype in RA trials may reduce the measuredclinical effectiveness of a new molecule.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01255761 .

"Comparing biosimilar SB2 with reference infliximab after 54 weeks of a double-blind trial: clinical, structural and safety results.",/pubmed/28957563,"Objectives: SB2 is a biosimilar to the reference infliximab (INF). Similarefficacy, safety and immunogenicity between SB2 and INF up to 30 weeks werepreviously reported. This report investigates such clinical similarity up to 54weeks, including structural joint damage.Methods: In this phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study,patients with moderate to severe RA despite MTX were randomized (1:1) to receive 3 mg/kg of either SB2 or INF at 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter.

The selected patientshad low disease activity from 6 months until 10 years and therefore did notintensify treatment. Patients were grouped into those receiving MTX monotherapyand those receiving initial combination therapy. Between-group differences overtime were compared, using (generalized) linear mixed model analyses, for theoutcomes DAS, HAQ, ESR, visual analogue scale patient global health, percentageof patients in (drug-free) remission and percentage of patients with Sharp/vander Heijde score progression _5.Results: At 10 years, 28/247 (11%) patients on MTX monotherapy (some tapered todrug free) had continued DAS _ 2.4 compared with 68/261 (26%) patients oncombination therapy (all tapered to monotherapy or drug free). No between-groupdifferences in continuous responders were found over time, except for a higherpercentage of patients in drug-free remission after MTX monotherapy. Significant group-time interactions were found for DAS, ESR and visual analogue scale patientglobal health, but the results seem clinically negligible.Conclusion: More patients achieved continuous low disease activity on initialprednisone or infliximab combination therapy than on initial MTX monotherapy, butthere appeared to be no additional benefits.

"Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of ABT-122, a Tumor Necrosis Factor- and Interleukin-17-Targeted Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulin, in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.",/pubmed/28941216,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) independentlycontribute to the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ABT-122 is anovel dual variable domain immunoglobulin that selectively and simultaneouslytargets human TNF and IL-17A. The aim of treatment with ABT-122 is to evoke agreater clinical response than that achieved by targeting either cytokine alone. This study was undertaken to present the pooled safety, tolerability, andexploratory pharmacodynamics of ABT-122 based on 2 phase I, placebo-controlled,multiple ascending-dose studies in patients with primarily inactive RA.METHODS: Patients (n = 44) receiving stable dosages of methotrexate (2.5-25mg/week) were randomized to receive subcutaneous placebo, ABT-122 1 mg/kg everyother week (4 doses), or ABT-122 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg weekly (8 doses) and wereevaluated through 45 days after the last dose (day 92). Serum samples for theassessment of inflammation markers and chemokines were collected at baseline and on postdose days 3, 5, 8, 15, 29, 57, 64, 78, and 92.RESULTS: No clinically significant findings regarding the safety of ABT-122 were observed. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar inpatients receiving ABT-122 and those receiving placebo. Only 1 serious AE (and nosystemic hypersensitivity reactions or dose-limiting toxicities) was observed in patients treated with ABT-122. The incidence of infections was similar betweenpatients treated with ABT-122 and those receiving placebo, with no seriousinfection reported. The levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL23, and soluble E-selectinwere significantly decreased following ABT-122 treatment relative to placebotreatment. Although patients had essentially inactive RA, exploratory clinicalparameters suggested potential antiinflammatory effects following treatment with ABT-122.CONCLUSION: The results of these phase I studies suggest that dual neutralizationof TNF and IL-17 with ABT-122 has characteristics acceptable for furtherexploration of therapeutic potential in TNF- and IL-17A-driven immune-mediatedinflammatory diseases.",RCT,,,,ABT-122,placebo,,,rheumatoid arthritis,inflammation markers and chemokines,
Insulin Resistance in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Is Associated with Low Appendicular Lean Mass.,/pubmed/28932748,"In established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the presence of insulin resistance (IR)is well proven but, in the early stage of the disease, data are inconclusive.

Using homeostatic model assessment of IR(HOMA-IR), the cut-off value for IR was 2.15. 56% of the ERA patients and 25% of the controls had IR. Of the BC parameters, patients with early RA had lessfat-free mass and appendicular lean mass (ALM). In multivariable model, ERA group(b-Coefficient) (4.8, CI: 2.6-8.8), male gender (7.7, CI: 2.7-22.1), and fat massindex (1.2, CI: 1.1-1.4) were associated with IR. Insulin-resistant ERA patients had higher inflammatory markers and higher disease activity. In the multivariablemodel in the ERA group, IR was associated with male gender (b-Coefficient) (7.4, CI: 153-34.9), high disease activity (6.2, CI: 1.7-22.2), and lower ALM (0.03,CI: 0.001-0.97).

The objectives wereto define the percentage of clinical scenarios from an ongoing cohort of RAoutpatients in which the German Ultrasound Score on 7 joints (GUS-7) impacted thetreatment and to explore if the impact differed between a senior rheumatologist(SR) vs. a trainee (TR).METHODS: Eighty-five consecutive and randomly selected RA outpatients underwent170 assessments, 85 each by the SR and the TR. Initially, both physicians(blinded to each other) performed a rheumatic assessment and recommended apreliminary treatment. Then, the patients underwent the GUS-7 evaluation by anexperienced rheumatologist blinded to clinical evaluations; selected joints ofthe clinically dominant hand were assessed by gray-scale and power Doppler (PD). In the final step, the TR and the SR integrated the GUS-7 findings with theirprevious evaluation and reviewed their recommendations. The patients received thefinal recommendation from the SR to avoid patient confusion. The study wasapproved by the Internal Review Board and all the patients signed informedconsent. GUS-7 usefulness was separately evaluated by the SR and the TR accordingto a visual analogue scale (0¾=¾not useful at all, 10¾=¾very useful). Descriptivestatistics were used.RESULTS: The patients were primarily middle-aged females (91.4%) with (mean¾±¾SD)disease duration of 7.5_±_3.9¾years. The majority of them (69.2% according to TR and 71.8% to SR) were in DAS28-ESR-remission.

As expected, the TR rated the GUS-7 usefulness higher than the SR, particularly in the clinical scenarios where the GUS-7 findings impactedtreatment.CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal ultrasound added to standard rheumatic assessmentsimpacted the treatment proposal in a limited number of patients; the impact wasgreater in the TR.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Adrenal insufficiency is seen in more than one-third of patients during ongoing low-dose prednisolone treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/28877961,"OBJECTIVE: Patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid treatment are at risk ofdeveloping adrenal insufficiency during treatment. We investigated the prevalenceof prednisolone-induced adrenal insufficiency in the particular clinicalsituation where patients receive ongoing low-dose (5_mg/day) prednisolonetreatment, a dose by itself too low to cover glucocorticoid needs during stress.DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 42 patients with rheumatoidarthritis (29 women, aged 36-86 years) treated with 5_mg prednisolone/day, whohad received prednisolone for _6 months (median: 66, range: 6-444 months).Adrenal function was evaluated by a 250__g Synacthen test performed after mean48.7_h prednisolone pause. Local assay-specific cut-off for normal adrenalfunction was P-cortisol _420_nmol/L 30_min after Synacthen injection.RESULTS: Overall, 20 of the 42 patients (48%, 95% CI: 33-62%) had an insufficientadrenal response to the Synacthen test. Including only patients who had notreceived concomitant treatment with any other glucocorticoid formulas within the last 3 months, 13 of 33 patients (39%, 95% CI: 25-56%) had an insufficientresponse. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were generally lowand anti-adrenal antibodies were negative indicating secondary adrenalinsufficiency as the most likely diagnosis.

Will Chinese external therapy with compound Tripterygium wilfordii hook F gel safely control disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: design of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28870177,"BACKGROUND: Chinese external therapy (CET) is a topical application with mainlyChinese herb medicine therapy with thousands of years of historical implications and is a clinical routine that is commonly used for relieving joint-relatedsymptoms in patients with arthritis in Chinese hospitals. However, there is apaucity of modern medical evidence to support its effectiveness and safety. Thus,we propose to implement a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinicaltrial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using, as the experimentalintervention, topical application of a hospital-compounded gel preparation ofTripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF).METHODS: This study will be an 8-week double-blinded, randomized,placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at Guang'anmen Hospital in Beijing,China, and 168 patients with moderately active RA will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to apply a topical gel preparation containing TwHF or placebo. Theprimary outcome variable will be the proportion of subjects, by study group, toachieve a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria(ACR20) by week 8. Secondary outcome measures to be assessed at weeks 4 or 8 willinclude: measurement of ACR20 response rate at week 4, ACR50 response rate, thechanges in DAS28 score, and joint synovitis classification assessment monitoredby musculoskeletal ultrasound. Safety evaluations conducted at weeks 4, 8 and 12 will be based on spontaneous complaints by the study subjects, but specialemphasis will be focused on cutaneous allergy and alterations of menstruation in premenopausal female participants. Statistical analyses will be performed usingthe intention to treat analysis data set.DISCUSSION: This proposed clinical trail is designed to evaluate the efficacy andsafety of CET based on a single topically-applied agent in a relatively largepatient population with RA. This study protocol gives a detailed description ofthe usage and dosage of the topical compound TwHF gel and the methodology of thisstudy. In addition, it is hoped that the outcomes of this study will be viewed assupporting the generalizability of CET in the setting of inflammatory rheumaticdiseases.

The aim of this post hoc analysis of arandomized double-blind study (the RISING study) was to investigate theinfluences of RF and anti-CCP on the clinical response to infliximab in patients with RA.METHODS: Methotrexate-refractory patients with RA received 3¾mg/kg of infliximab from weeks 0 to 6 and then 3, 6, or 10¾mg/kg every 8¾weeks from weeks 14 to 46.In this post hoc analysis, patients were stratified into three classes on thebasis of baseline RF/anti-CCP titers: ""low/low-C"" (RF_<_55¾IU/ml, anti-CCP_<_42U/ml), ""high/high-C"" (RF___160¾IU/ml, anti-CCP___100 U/ml), and ""middle-C""(neither low/low-C nor high/high-C). Baseline plasma TNF level, serum infliximab level, and disease activity were compared between the three classes.RESULTS: Baseline RF and anti-CCP titers showed significant correlations withbaseline TNF and infliximab levels in weeks 2-14. Comparison of the three classesshowed that baseline TNF level was lowest in the low/low-C group and highest inthe high/high-C group (median 0.73 versus 1.15¾pg/ml), that infliximab levels at week 14 were highest in the low/low-C group and lowest in the high/high-C group(median 1.0 versus 0.1¾_g/ml), and that Disease Activity Score in 28 joints basedon C-reactive protein at week 14 was lowest in the low/low-C group and highest inthe high/high-C group (median 3.17 versus 3.82). A similar correlation wasobserved at week 54 in the 3¾mg/kg dosing group, but not in the 6 or 10¾mg/kggroup. Significant decreases in both RF and anti-CCP were observed duringinfliximab treatment.CONCLUSIONS: RF/anti-CCP titers correlated with TNF level. This might explain theassociation of RF/anti-CCP with infliximab level and clinical response inpatients with RA.

After 1 year, treatment was continuedwithout protocol, and adjusted by the treating physician according to clinicaljudgement, preferably with a treat-to-target strategy. Four years after trialinitiation, all patients were invited to participate in the COBRA-light extensionstudy, in which patients were interviewed and physically examined, patientreported outcomes were assessed, radiographs were made and clinical records were examined for comorbidities and medication use.Results: In the extension study, 149 out of 162 (92%) original trial patientsparticipated: 72 COBRA-light and 77 COBRA patients. Initial COBRA-light and COBRAtherapy showed similar effect on disease activity, physical functioning,radiological outcome and Boolean remission over the 4-year follow-up period. Inaddition, both treatment groups showed similar survival and major comorbidities, although the power to detect differences was limited. Besides protocolleddifferences in prednisolone, MTX and SSZ use, the use of other synthetic andbiologic DMARDs and intra-articular and intramuscular glucocorticoid injectionswas similar in both treatment groups over the 4-year period.Conclusion: Early RA patients initially treated with COBRA-light or COBRA therapyhad similar efficacy and safety outcomes over a 4-year follow-up period.",RCT,,,,COBRA-light (prednisolone and MTX),"COBRA therapy (prednisolone, MTX and SSZ)",,,rheumatoid arthritis,disease activity,
Sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis: the phase III SIRROUND-D study.,/pubmed/28855173,"OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)pathophysiology.

Ultra-low dose of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/28854956,"BACKGROUND: A standard low-dosing schedule of rituximab (RTX; 2___500¾mg or1___1000¾mg) is as effective for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as theregistered dose (2___1000¾mg). Moreover, several small uncontrolled studiessuggest that even lower-dosed treatment with RTX also leads to good treatmentresponse in patients with RA. Retreatment with such an 'ultra-low' dose RTX inpatients who responded well to RTX induction treatment is of special interest, aslong-term use of lower RTX doses may lead to shorter infusion duration, lowerrisk of adverse events and lower costs. However, the effect of ultra-low dose of RTX has not been investigated using a controlled trial of proper design anddimensions.METHODS/DESIGN: REDO is an investigator driven six-month pragmatic, double-blind,randomised controlled non-inferiority trial on the effects of ultra-low-dose RTX (1___500 or 1___200¾mg) compared to standard low dose (1___1000¾mg) in RApatients who are being retreated with RTX. A total of 140 RA patients, havingreached low disease activity (DAS28CRP_<_2.9) after the previous RTX infusion andDAS28CRP_<_3.5 at moment of retreatment, are randomised in a ratio of 1:2:2 to1___1000¾mg, 1___500¾mg or 1___200¾mg. The primary objective is testingnon-inferiority of the ultra-low-dose vs. standard low-dose RTX, by comparingmean change in DAS28CRP from baseline to six months to the non-inferiority marginof 0.6. Secondary outcomes over the same period are: function; quality of life;safety; costs; and pharmacokinetics and dynamics as process measures.DISCUSSION: This study protocol shares characteristics of both early dose findingtrials as well as late pragmatic clinical studies. Several choices in the design of this trial are described and possible consequences for RA treatment andexpected biosimilar introduction are discussed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register, NTR6117 .

"A Novel Highly Bioavailable Curcumin Formulation Improves Symptoms and Diagnostic Indicators in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Two-Dose, Three-Arm, and Parallel-Group Study.",/pubmed/28850308,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic systemic inflammatorydisorder. The long-term use of currently available drugs for the treatment of RA has many potential side effects. Natural phytonutrients may serve as alternative strategies for the safe and effective treatment of RA, and curcuminoids have beenused in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of inflammatory conditions forcenturies. In this study, a novel, highly bioavailable form of curcumin in acompletely natural turmeric matrix was evaluated for its ability to improve theclinical symptoms of RA. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,three-arm, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the comparativeefficacy of two different doses of curcumin with that of a placebo in active RApatients. Twelve patients in each group received placebo, 250 or 500_mg of thecurcumin product twice daily for 90 days. The responses of the patients wereassessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response, visual analogscale (VAS), C-reactive protein (CRP), Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28),erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and rheumatoid factor (RF) values. RApatients who received the curcumin product at both low and high doses reportedstatistically significant changes in their clinical symptoms at the end of thestudy. These observations were confirmed by significant changes in ESR, CPR, and RF values in patients receiving the study product compared to baseline andplacebo. The results indicate that this novel curcumin in a turmeric matrix acts as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent for the management of RA at a dose aslow as 250_mg twice daily as evidenced by significant improvement in the ESR,CRP, VAS, RF, DAS28, and ACR responses compared to placebo.

"Suppression of active, but not total MMP-3, is associated with treatment response in a phase III clinical study of rheumatoid arthritis.",/pubmed/28850021,"OBJECTIVE: Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with moderate tosevere disease may preserve joint function. Matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), akey tissue degrading protease, is highly elevated in RA. MMP-3, which measuresthe total pool of circulating MMP-3 species (cMMP3), is a commonly measuredbiomarker in rheumatology. The aim was to investigate the association ofactivated MMP-3 (actMMP3) species with treatment response compared to cMMP-3.METHODS: The LITHE biomarker study (n=741) was a 1-year phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of TCZ in RA patients on stablemethotrexate. cMMP-3 and actMMP-3 were assessed in fasting serum at baseline,week 4, 16, 24 and 52. Patients not achieving ACR20 remission at week 16 or 28received rescue treatment (escapers). Spearman's correlation was analysed betweenbiomarker baseline level or biomarker delta and clinical measures. Changes inbiomarker levels were studied as a function of time and treatment.RESULTS: ActMMP-3 16-week change in treatment groups was predictive of 1-yearradiographic progression; a small change in actMMP3 was equal to worseningradiographics. Baseline cMMP-3 was associated with 52-weeks' radiographic status and cMMP3 16-weeks' change was predictive of 1-year change in disease activity.ActMMP-3 was dose-dependently decreased by TCZ, and escapers decreased inactMMP-3 upon treatment.CONCLUSIONS: ActMMP-3 and cMMP-3 were found to be efficacy biomarkers of TCZ and actMMP-3 were able to differentiated doses. Moreover, the suppression of actMMP3,but not cMMP3 was associated with treatment response. This study illustrates thattwo biomarkers of the same protein may have different predictive capacities.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Safety and Immunogenicity of Live Zoster Vaccination in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Before Starting Tofacitinib: A Randomized Phase II Trial.,/pubmed/28845577,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk ofherpes zoster, and vaccination is recommended for patients ages 50 years andolder, prior to starting treatment with biologic agents or tofacitinib.Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. We evaluated itseffect on the immune response and safety of live zoster vaccine (LZV).METHODS: In this phase II, 14-week, placebo-controlled trial, patients ages 50years and older who had active RA and were receiving background methotrexate weregiven LZV and randomized to receive tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or placebo 2-3weeks postvaccination. We measured humoral responses (varicella zoster virus[VZV]-specific IgG level as determined by glycoprotein enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay) and cell-mediated responses (VZV-specific T cellenumeration, as determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay) at baseline and 2weeks, 6 weeks, and 14 weeks postvaccination. End points included the geometricmean fold rise (GMFR) in VZV-specific IgG levels (primary end point) and T cells (number of spot-forming cells/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) at 6 weeks postvaccination.RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were randomized to receive tofacitinib(n_=_55) or placebo (n_=_57). Six weeks postvaccination, the GMFR in VZV-specificIgG levels was 2.11 in the tofacitinib group and 1.74 in the placebo group, andthe VZV-specific T cell GMFR was similar in the tofacitinib group and the placebogroup (1.50 and 1.29, respectively). Serious adverse events occurred in 3patients in the tofacitinib group (5.5%) and 0 patients (0.0%) in the placebogroup. One patient, who lacked preexisting VZV immunity, developed cutaneousvaccine dissemination 2 days after starting tofacitinib (16 dayspostvaccination). This resolved after tofacitinib was discontinued and thepatient received antiviral treatment.CONCLUSION: Patients who began treatment with tofacitinib 2-3 weeks afterreceiving LZV had VZV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to LZV similar to those in placebo-treated patients.

Glycoprotein YKL-40: A potential biomarker of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis during intensive treatment with csDMARDs and infliximab. Evidence from the randomised controlled NEO-RACo trial.,/pubmed/28841649,"OBJECTIVE: YKL-40, a chitinase-like glycoprotein associated with inflammation andtissue remodeling, is produced by joint tissues and recognized as a candidateauto-antigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we investigated YKL-40 as a potential biomarker of disease activity in patients with early RA at baseline and during intensive treatment aiming for early remission.METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with early DMARD-na´ve RA participated in theNEO-RACo study. For the first four weeks, the patients were treated with thecombination of sulphasalazine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and low doseprednisolone (FIN-RACo DMARD combination), and subsequently randomized to receiveplacebo or infliximab added on the treatment for further 22 weeks. Diseaseactivity was evaluated using the 28-joint disease activity score and plasmaYKL-40 concentrations were measured by immunoassay.RESULTS: At the baseline, plasma YKL-40 concentration was 57 ± 37 (mean ± SD)ng/ml. YKL-40 was significantly associated with the disease activity score,interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate both at the baseline and during the 26 weeks' treatment. The csDMARD combination decreased YKL-40 levels already during the first four weeks of treatment, and there was no further reduction whenthe tumour necrosis factor-_ antagonist infliximab was added on the combinationtreatment.CONCLUSIONS: High YKL-40 levels were found to be associated with disease activityin early DMARD-na´ve RA and during intensive treat-to-target therapy. The presentresults suggest YKL-40 as a useful biomarker of disease activity in RA to be usedto steer treatment towards remission.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Exposure-Response Modeling and Power Analysis of Components of ACR Response Criteria in Rheumatoid Arthritis (Part 2: Continuous Model).,/pubmed/28817201,"Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models were developed toquantitate the exposure-response relationships using continuous longitudinal dataon American College of Rheumatology (ACR) subcomponents, that is, tender-jointcount (TJC), swollen-joint count (SJC), C-reactive protein, patient's assessment of pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, physician's globalassessment of disease activity, and patient's assessment of physical function for5 biologics approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis. The models were then usedto simulate the time courses of clinical outcomes following different treatmentregimens. The relative sensitivity of the 7 subcomponents was assessed usingMonte Carlo simulation-based power analysis. The developed population PK/PDmodels adequately described the relationship between serum concentrations andchanges in ACR subcomponents. The trial simulation and subsequent power analysis showed that SJC and TJC appeared to be more sensitive than the other 5 ACRsubcomponents to detect treatment effect over placebo/methotrexate. These 7 ACRsubcomponents had similar power in detecting the treatment difference betweendifferent doses.

Calprotectin as a marker of inflammation in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/28814431,"OBJECTIVES: Calprotectin is an inflammatory marker of interest in rheumatoidarthritis (RA). We evaluated whether the level of calprotectin was associatedwith disease activity, and if it was predictive of treatment response andradiographic progression in patients with early RA.METHODS: Plasma from disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-na´ve patients with RA fulfilling 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria with symptom duration <2 years was analysedfor calprotectin at baseline, and after 1, 3 and 12 months. All patients receivedtreat-to-target therapy, as part of a randomised controlled strategy trial(ARCTIC). The association between calprotectin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) and measures of disease activity were assessedby correlations. We used likelihood ratios and logistic regression models toassess the predictive value of the baseline inflammatory markers for treatmentresponse and radiographic damage.RESULTS: 215 patients were included: 61% female, 82% anti-citrullinated peptideantibody positive, mean (SD) age 50.9 (13.7) years and median (25, 75 percentile)symptom duration 5.8 (2.8, 10.5) months. Calprotectin was significantlycorrelated with Clinical Disease Activity Index (r=0.32), ESR (r=0.50) andultrasonography power Doppler (r=0.42) before treatment onset. After 12 months oftreatment, calprotectin, but not ESR and CRP, was significantly correlated withpower Doppler (r=0.27). Baseline levels of calprotectin, ESR and CRP were notpredictive of treatment response, but high levels of calprotectin were associatedwith radiographic progression in multivariate models.CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin was correlated with inflammation assessed by ultrasoundbefore and during DMARD treatment, and was also associated with radiographicprogression.

B cell phenotypes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis relapsing after rituximab: expression of B cell-activating factor-binding receptors on B cell subsets.,/pubmed/28800164,"Serum levels of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) rise following rituximab (RTX)therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Initiation of naive B cellreturn to the periphery and autoreactive B cell expansion leading to relapseafter RTX may therefore be linked to interactions between BAFF and BAFF-bindingreceptors (BBR). Relationships between serum BAFF and BBR expression [(BAFFR,calcium signal modulating cyclophilic ligand interactor (TACI) and B cellmaturation antigen (BCMA)] were determined on B cell subsets, defined usingimmunoglobulin (Ig)D/CD38. Twenty pre-RTX and 18 RA patients relapsing after Bcell depletion were included. Results were analysed with respect to timing ofrelapse up to 7 months after peripheral B cell return (_¾5 B cells/_l) and toserum BAFF levels. After B cell return, B cell populations from relapsingpatients had significantly lower BAFFR+ expression compared to HC and pre-RTXpatients. The percentage of BAFFR+ B cells increased with time after B cellreturn and was correlated inversely with serum BAFF levels. BAFFR expressionremained reduced. The percentage of TACI+ memory B cells were lower in RApatients after RTX compared with healthy controls (HC). BCMA expression (% andexpression) did not differ between patients and HC. Relapse following B cellreturn appeared largely independent of the percentage of BAFFR+ or percentage of BCMA+ B cells or serum BAFF levels. The lower percentage of TACI+ memory B cells may reduce inhibitory signalling for B cell differentiation. In patientsrelapsing at longer periods after B cell return, recovery of the B cell pool was more complete, suggesting that selection or expansion of autoreactive B cells maybe needed to precipitate relapse.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The 18F_FDG PET/CT characteristicobservations of 32¾patients with definite AOSD were retrospectively reviewedbased on visual interpretation and the semi_quantitative index of standard uptakevalue of maximum (SUVmax). Among 32¾patients, no normal case was observed.Abnormal FDG accumulation by the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes was the mainobservation of the PET/CT images. Totals of 27 (84.4%) and 26¾cases (81.3%) were identified with diffusely elevated FDG uptake by the spleen and bone marrow,respectively, and the average SUVmax was 4.2±1.1 and 4.6±0.6, respectively.

Following three days VR training,rheumatology occupational therapists provided individualised VR on a one to onebasis. VR included work assessment, activity diaries and action planning, and (asapplicable) arthritis self-management in the workplace, ergonomics, fatigue andstress management, orthoses, employment rights and support services, assistivetechnology, work modifications, psychological and disclosure support, workplacevisits and employer liaison.RESULTS: Fifty five (10%) people were recruited from 539 screened. Follow-upresponse rates were acceptable at 80%. VR was delivered with fidelity. VR wasmore acceptable than written advice only (7.8 versus 6.7). VR took on average 4¾hat a cost of £135 per person. Outcome assessment indicated VR was better thanwritten advice in reducing presenteeism (Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ)change score mean: VR¾=¾-12.4 (SD 13.2); control¾=¾-2.5 (SD 15.9), absenteeism,perceived risk of job loss and improving pain and health status, indicating proofof concept.

Physical examinations, vital signevaluations, and laboratory tests were conducted in patients at baseline and at12-week and 24-week visits. The primary endpoint in this study was the proportionof patients achieving moderate and good disease activity score in 28joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR)-based European League AgainstRheumatism (EULAR) response.

Identification of differential co-expressed gene networks in early rheumatoid arthritis achieving sustained drug-free remission after treatment with a tocilizumab-based or methotrexate-based strategy.,/pubmed/28728565,"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate is endorsed to be used as first-line treatment inrheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a large proportion of patients needadditional treatment with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug(DMARD) to adequately suppress their disease activity. A better understanding of genotypes could help to distinguish between patients with different pathogenicmechanisms. The aim of this study was therefore to identify networks of geneswithin DMARD-naive early RA patients associated with achieving sustaineddrug-free remission (sDFR) after initiating tocilizumab plus methotrexate,tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy.METHODS: Samples were used from 60 patients from the U-Act-Early study whoreceived tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy, andwho achieved sDFR (_3¾months in drug-free remission until the end of the study,n_=_37) after therapy was tapered and subsequently stopped, or who were not able to discontinue the therapy as controls (n_=_23). Whole blood samples werecollected and ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from positive cluster ofdifferentiation 4 (CD4+) and CD14+ cells and analysed using high-throughputsequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses were performed toidentify clusters (i.e. modules) of differently expressed genes associated withachieving sDFR and which were subsequently used for pathway analyses.RESULTS: Network analyses within CD4+ cells identified two significant modules inthe tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm and four modules in the tocilizumab andmethotrexate arms, respectively (p___0.039). Important pathways in the modulebest correlating with achieving sDFR were in the tocilizumab plus methotrexatearm related to processes involved with transcription and translation; in thetocilizumab arm, pathways were related to migration of white blood cells andG-protein coupled receptors, and in the methotrexate arm pathways were involvedwith the response to a bacterial or biotic (i.e. biological material)-relatedstimulus. No relevant networks could be identified in the sequenced CD14+ cells.CONCLUSIONS: Within networks of co-expressed genes, several pathways were foundrelated to achieving sDFR after initiating therapy with tocilizumab,methotrexate, or the combination. Between the three strategy arms, we identified different networks of predisposing genes which indicates that specific geneexpression profiles, depending on the treatment strategy chosen, are associatedwith a higher chance of achieving sDFR.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01034137 .

Leflunomide is equally efficacious and safe compared to low dose rituximab in refractory rheumatoid arthritis given in combination with methotrexate: results from a randomized double blind controlled clinical trial.,/pubmed/28724365,"BACKGROUND: The standard dose of rituximab used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is1000¾mg but recent studies have shown that low dose (500¾mg) is also effective.Efficacy of low dose rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory tofirst-line non-biologic Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), comparedto leflunomide is unknown. In a tertiary care referral setting, we conducted arandomized, double blind controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy andsafety of low-dose rituximab-methotrexate combination withleflunomide-methotrexate combination.METHODS: Patients on methotrexate (10-20¾mg/week) with a Disease Activity Score(DAS)¾>¾3.2 were randomly assigned to rituximab (500¾mg on days 1 and 15) orleflunomide (10-20¾mg/day). The primary end-point was ACR20 at 24¾weeks. Sampleof 40 had 70% power to detect a 30% difference. ACR50, ACR70, DAS, EULAR goodresponse, CD3¾+¾(T cell), CD19¾+¾(B cell) and CD19¾+¾CD27+ (memory B cell)counts, tetanus and pneumococcal antibody levels were secondary end points.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. At week 24, ACR20 was 85% vs 84% (p¾=¾0.93), ACR50 was 60% vs. 64% (p¾=¾0.79) and ACR70 was35% vs 32% (P¾=¾0.84), in rituximab and in leflunomide groups respectively.Serious adverse events were similar. With rituximab there was significantreduction in B cells (p¾<¾0.001), memory B cells (p¾<¾0.001) and pneumococcalantibody levels (P¾<¾0.05) without significant changes in T cells (p¾=¾0.835) andtetanus antibody levels (p¾=¾0.424) at 24¾weeks. With leflunomide, significantreduction in memory B cells (p¾<¾0.01) and pneumococcal antibody levels(p¾<¾0.01) occurred without significant changes in B cells (P¾>¾0.05), T cells(P¾>¾0.05) or tetanus antibody levels (P¾>¾0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Leflunomide-methotrexate combination is as efficacious as low-doserituximab-methotrexate combination at 24¾weeks, in RA patient's refractory toinitial DMARDs.

"Rituximab biosimilar and reference rituximab in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma (ASSIST-FL): primary results from a confirmatory phase 3, double-blind, randomised, controlled study.",/pubmed/28712941,"BACKGROUND: GP2013 is a rituximab biosimilar developed to stringent developmentguidelines, including non-clinical and preclinical investigations and clinicaltrials in rheumatoid arthritis and follicular lymphoma. We aimed to compare theefficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GP2013 plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (GP2013-CVP) withrituximab-CVP (R-CVP) in patients with follicular lymphoma.METHODS: In this phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomised, controlledtrial, adults (aged 18 years or older) with previously untreated, advanced stage (Ann Arbor stage III or IV) follicular lymphoma of WHO histological grades 1, 2, or 3a were randomly assigned (1:1) using interactive response technology to eightcycles of GP2013-CVP or R-CVP (combination phase), followed by monotherapymaintenance in responders for a 2-year period. Randomisation was stratified byFollicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk group and geographicregion. The primary endpoint was comparability in overall response, withequivalence concluded if the entire 95% CI was within a margin of -12% to 12%.The primary endpoint was analysed using the per-protocol set, which included all patients who received at least one (partial or complete) dose of investigational treatment and who did not have any major protocol deviations.

Median follow-up was 11à6 months (IQR 5à8-18à2) for the primary analysis. The primary endpoint,equivalence of overall response, was met (271 [87%] of 311 patients with GP2013and 274 [88%] of 313 patients with reference rituximab achieved an overallresponse; difference -0à40% [95% CI -5à94 to 5à14]). Occurrence of adverse eventsand serious adverse events was similar between the treatment groups (289 [93%] of312 patients in the GP2013-CVP group had an adverse event and 71 [23%] of 312patients had a serious adverse event; 288 [91%] of 315 patients in the R-CVPgroup had an adverse event and 63 [20%] had a serious adverse event).

"Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of the biosimilar CT-P10 compared with rituximab in patients with previously untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.",/pubmed/28712940,"BACKGROUND: Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have shown that therituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (Celltrion, Incheon, South Korea) has equivalentefficacy and pharmacokinetics to rituximab. In this phase 3 study, we aimed toassess the non-inferior efficacy and pharmacokinetic equivalence of CT-P10compared with rituximab, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide,vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) in patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stagefollicular lymphoma.METHODS: In this ongoing, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,active-controlled study, patients aged 18 years or older with Ann Arbor stageIII-IV follicular lymphoma were assigned 1:1 to CVP plus intravenous infusions of375 mg/m2 CT-P10 or rituximab on day 1 of eight 21-day cycles. Randomisation was done by the investigators using an interactive web or voice response system and acomputer-generated randomisation schedule, prepared by a clinical researchorganisation. Randomisation was balanced using permuted blocks and was stratifiedby country, gender, and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score (0-2 vs 3-5). Study teams from the sponsor and clinical research organisation,investigators, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The study wasdivided into two parts: part 1 assessing equivalence of pharmacokinetics (in the pharmacokinetics subset), and part 2 assessing efficacy in all randomisedpatients (patients from the pharmacokinetics subset plus additional patientsenrolled in part 2). Equivalence of pharmacokinetics was shown if the 90% CIs forthe geometric mean ratio of CT-P10 to rituximab in AUC_ and CmaxSS were withinthe bounds of the equivalence margin of 80% and 125%. Non-inferiority of responsewas shown if the one-sided 97à5% CI lay on the positive side of the -7% margin,using a one-sided test done at the 2à5% significance level. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an overall response over eightcycles and was assessed in the efficacy population (all randomised patients).

The ratio ofgeometric least squares means (CT-P10/rituximab) was 102à25% (90% CI94à05-111à17) for AUC_ and 100à67% (93à84-108à00) for CmaxSS, with all CIs withinthe bioequivalence margin of 80-125%. Treatment-emergent adverse events werereported for 58 (83%) of 70 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 56 (80%)of 70 in the rituximab treatment group. The most common grade 3 or 4treatment-emergent adverse event in each treatment group was neutropenia (grade3, 15 [21%] of 70 patients in the CT-P10 group and seven [10%] of 70 patients in the rituximab group). The proportion of patients who experienced at least onetreatment-emergent serious adverse event was 16 (23%) of 70 patients in theCT-P10 group and nine (13%) of 70 patients in the rituximab group.INTERPRETATION: In this study, we show that CT-P10 exhibits non-inferior efficacyand pharmacokinetic equivalence to rituximab.

The primary end point was the percentage of patients who maintained low disease activity throughout weeks52-104 without flares. We used a hierarchical testing scheme, comparing CZP at a standard dose with CZP stopped. If P < 0.05 was achieved, then CZP at a reducedfrequency was compared with CZP stopped (nonresponder imputation).RESULTS: The 293 patients from period 1 represented 36% fewer patients thanprojected, yielding a smaller number of patients eligible for period 2. Higherproportions of patients treated with the standard and reduced frequency regimens maintained low disease activity than those who had stopped CZP (48.8% and 53.2%, respectively, versus 39.2% [P_=_0.112 and P_=_0.041, respectively; nominal Pvalue, first hierarchical test not significant]). Similar trends were observedfor radiographic nonprogression (change from baseline of _0.5 in modifiedSharp/van der Heijde score; 79.2% and 77.9% of patients, respectively, versus70.3%) and normative physical function (Health Assessment Questionnairedisability index score of _0.5; 71.4% and 70.6% of patients, respectively, versus57.0%). Safety profiles were similar between all groups, with no new safetysignals identified for continuing CZP to week 104.

These features, and changes therein, were assessed for associations with health assessment questionnaires (HAQ),patient global visual analogue scales (VAS-PtGlobal) and VAS-pain usingSpearman's correlations, generalised estimating equations andunivariate/multivariable linear regression analyses. MRI features were furthertested for trends against specific hand-related HAQ items using Jonckheere trend tests.RESULTS: MRI inflammation, but not damage, showed statistically significantassociations with HAQ, VAS-PtGlobal and VAS-pain for status and change scores,independently of C reactive protein and swollen joint count. MRI-assessedsynovitis was most consistently associated with PROs, particularly VAS-PtGlobaland VAS-pain. MRI-assessed synovitis and tenosynovitis mean scores werepositively associated with patient-reported difficulty to cut meat and open amilk carton (p<0.01), and similar patterns were seen for other hand-related HAQitems. Incorporating metacarpophalangeal joints in the analyses did notstrengthen the associations between MRI pathology and PROs.CONCLUSIONS: MRI-assessed inflammation, but not damage, in early RA wrists isassociated with patient-reported physical impairment, global assessment ofdisease activity and pain and influences the physical function in the hand.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00660647.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term outcomes after disease activity-guided dose reduction of TNF inhibition in rheumatoid arthritis: 3-year data of the DRESS study - a randomised controlled pragmatic non-inferiority strategy trial.,/pubmed/28606961,"OBJECTIVE: Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are effective in rheumatoidarthritis (RA), but disadvantages include adverse events (AEs) and high costs.This can be improved by disease activity-guided dose reduction (DR). We aimed to assess long-term outcomes of TNFi DR in RA by using 3-year data from the DRESSstudy (Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors study).METHODS: In the intervention phase (month 0-18) of the DRESS study (Dutch trialregister, NTR 3216), patients were randomised to DR or usual care (UC). In theextension phase (month 18-36), treatment strategies in both groups converged tocontinuation of protocolised tight control and allowed dose optimisation.Intention-to-treat analyses were done on flare, disease activity (28_jointcount-based disease activity score with C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP)),functioning (health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI)), quality of life (Euroqol 5 dimensions 5 levels questionnaire (EQ5D-5L)), medication use, radiographic progression (Sharp van der Heijde score (SvdH)) and AE.RESULTS: 172/180 patients included in the DRESS study were included in theextension phase. Cumulative incidences of major flare were 10% and 12% (-2%,95%_CI -8 to 15) in DR and UC groups in the extension phase, and 17% and 14% (3%,95%_CI -9 to 13) from 0 to 36 months. Cumulative incidences of short-lived flareswere 43% (33 to 52%)%) and 35% (23 to 49%)%) in DR and UC groups in the extensionphase, and 83% (75 to 90%)%) and 44% (31 to 58%)%) from 0 to 36 months.

Anti-TNF-± effects on anemia in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.,/pubmed/28604144,"A key role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriaticarthritis (PsA) is played by inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosisfactor-_ (TNF-_), which are also involved in inducing inflammatory anemia. Wehave followed 67 RA patients and 64 PsA patients for 1_year to evaluate theeffects of TNF-_ inhibitors on disease activity and on inflammatory anemia.Patients were divided into three different treatment groups, according to arandomized assignment to receive therapy with etanercept, adalimumab, orinfliximab. Treatment with anti-TNF-_ resulted in a significant reduction indisease activity score-28 (DAS28) values both in RA and PsA patients, alreadyfrom the third month of treatment ( P_=_0.01). In both populations, there was an increase in hemoglobin (HB) levels already after 3_months of treatment (P_=_0.001), and HB levels were inversely proportional to the disease activity,regardless of the type of medication used. The increased HB values and thereduction of DAS28 values during the observation period suggest the existence of a negative correlation between them both in RA and PsA, regardless of the type ofanti-TNF-_ used.

Soluble CD206 plasma levels in rheumatoid arthritis reflect decrease in disease activity.,/pubmed/28598681,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic joint inflammation andinfiltration by activated macrophages. TNF_ is a central mediator in thisprocess. The mannose receptor, CD206, is a scavenger receptor expressed byM2A-macrophages and dendritic cells. It is involved in collagen internalizationand degradation. The soluble form has been suggested as a biomarker ofM2A-macrophage activation. The aim of this study was to investigate sCD206 plasmalevels in early RA patients initiating anti-TNF_ treatment. Plasma levels ofsCD206 were measured by ELISA in samples from 155 early RA patients with anaverage symptom duration of 3 months. Patients were randomized to 12 months'methotrexate and placebo (PLA) or methotrexate and adalimumab (ADA) treatment,followed by open-label treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs(DMARD) and if needed, ADA. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and after3, 6, 12 and 24_months. Baseline plasma level of sCD206 in treatment na´ve RApatients was 0.33_mg/L (CI: 0.33-0.38_mg/L) corresponding to the upper part ofthe reference interval for healthy controls (0.10-0.43_mg/L). In the PLA group,sCD206 levels decreased after 3_months, but did not differ from baseline after6_months. In the ADA group, however, levels remained lower than baselinethroughout the treatment period. In conclusion, initially, plasma sCD206 in earlyRA patients decreased in accordance with disease activity and initiation of DMARDtreatment.

Limited value for ultrasonography in predicting flare in rheumatoid arthritis patients with low disease activity stopping TNF inhibitors.,/pubmed/28595367,"Objective: Ultrasonography (US) can be used for treatment decisions in RApatients. This study investigated the added value of US to clinical variables in predicting flare in RA patients with longstanding low disease activity whenstopping TNF inhibitors (TNFi).Methods: Cox models with and without using US added to clinical variables weredeveloped in the Potential Optimization of Expediency of TNFi-UltraSonographystudy. RA patients (n = 259), using >1 year TNFi and csDMARD with DAS28 < 3.2 for6 months prior to inclusion, were followed for 52 weeks after stopping TNFi. The added value of US was assessed in two ways: first, by the extent to whichindividual predictions for flare at 52 weeks with and without US differed; andsecond, by comparing how US information improved the prediction to classifypatients at 52 weeks in the low risk (<33% flare), intermediate risk (33-50%) andhigh risk (50-100%) groups.Results: Although US was predictive of flare at group level (multivariate hazard ratio = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.5), individual predictions for flare at 52 weeks withand without US differed little (median difference 3.7%; interquartile range: -7.8to 6.5%). With US, 15.9% of patients were designated low risk; without US, 14.6%.In fact, 12.0% of patients were US-classified as low risk with/without knowingUS.Conclusion: In RA patients with longstanding low disease activity, at time ofstopping TNFi, US is a predictor for flare at group level, but at the patientlevel, US has limited added value when common clinical parameters are usedalready, though the predictive value of clinical predictors is modest as well.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Comparison of the Effects of a Pharmaceutical Industry Decision Guide and Decision Aids on Patient Choice to Intensify Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,/pubmed/28590834,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects a pharmaceutical industry decision guide andInternational Patient Decision Aids Standard (IPDAS) compliant patient decisionaids (PtDA) on patient medication beliefs and choice to intensify therapy.METHODS: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who had never taken etanercept(Enbrel), took part in a mail survey. They were presented with a hypotheticaldecision scenario where they were asked to consider adding etanercept to theircurrent regimen. Each patient was randomized to review 1 of 3 forms of anetanercept-specific decision support: a long PtDA (LONG DA), a short PtDA (SHORT DA), or the manufacturer's Enbrel decision guide (Pharm Booklet).RESULTS: We had 402 RA patients participate in the study (response rate, 52%). Ofthe patients randomized to the Pharm Booklet, 30.6% elected to initiateetanercept. Only 14.6% and 14.0% of patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DAchoose to take etanercept (_2 = 15.7; P < 0.001). Patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA had a greater increase in knowledge about etanercept than thosewho reviewed the Pharm Booklet. There was no difference in decisional conflictamong the groups. A logistic regression model explained 44.2% (R2 = 0.442) ofpatient choice to intensify therapy by initiating etanercept. The strongestpredictor of choice to intensify therapy were beliefs about etanercept's ability to improve symptoms (OR = 2.56, 96%CI [1.71, 3.80]), and its use by others likethe respondent (OR = 2.24, 95%CI [1.49, 3.35]). Mediation analysis confirmed the presence of a partial mediating effect of decision support on patients' intent totake etanercept (OR = 0.59, 95%CI [0.39, 0.89]).CONCLUSIONS: Patients supported by the Pharm Booklet were twice as likely tochoose to intensify therapy. The Pharm Booklet's effects are partially mediatedthrough persuasive communication techniques that influence patients' beliefs thatsymptoms will improve, and increase social normative beliefs, rather than byincreasing the relevant knowledge, clarifying patient values about positive ornegative treatment outcomes, or increasing their self-efficacy.",RCT,,,,long patient decision aids (PtDA),short patient decision aids (PtDA),manufacturer's Enbrel decision guide,,rheumatoid arthritis,knowledge about etanercept,

During this period, 185 patientsunderwent TAA, with 144 being eligible to participate in this study. Patientswere eligible to participate if they were able to meet all study inclusioncriteria, which were: no previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, acontralateral TAA, bilateral ankle arthritis, previous revision TAA, an anklefusion revision, or able to walk without the use of an assistive device, weightless than 250 pounds (114¾kg), a sagittal or coronal plane deformity less than15ç, no presence of avascular necrosis of the distal tibia, no currentneuropathy, age older than 35¾years, no history of a talar neck fracture, or anavascular talus. Of the 144 eligible patients, 40 consented to participate in ourrandomized trial. These 40 patients were randomly assigned to either the fixed(n¾=¾20) or mobile bearing implant group (n¾=¾20). Walking speed, bilateral peak dorsiflexion angle, peak plantar flexion angle, sagittal plane ankle ROM, peakankle inversion angle, peak plantar flexion moment, peak plantar flexion powerduring stance, peak weight acceptance, and propulsive vertical ground reactionforce were analyzed during seven self-selected speed level walking trials for 33 participants using an eight-camera motion analysis system and four force plates. Seven patients were not included in the analysis owing to cancelled surgery (one from each group) and five were lost to followup (four with fixed bearing and one with mobile bearing implants). A series of effect-size calculations andtwo-sample t-tests comparing postoperative and preoperative increases in outcome variables between implant types were used to determine the differences in themagnitude of improvement between the two patient cohorts from before surgery to1¾year after surgery. The sample size in this study enabled us to detect astandardized shift of 1.01 SDs between group means with 80% power and a type Ierror rate of 5% for all outcome variables in the study.RESULTS: This randomized trial did not reveal any differences in outcomes betweenthe two implant types under study at the sample size collected. In addition tothese results, effect size analysis suggests that changes in outcome differbetween implant types by less than 1 SD. Detection of the largest change score orobserved effect (propulsive vertical ground reaction force [Fixed: 0.1¾±¾0.1;0.0-1.0; Mobile: 0.0¾±¾0.1; 0.0-0.0; p¾=¾0.0.051]) in this study would require a future trial to enroll 66 patients. However, the smallest change score orobserved effect (walking speed [Fixed: 0.2¾±¾0.3; 0.1-0.4; Mobile: 0.2¾±¾0.3;0.0-0.3; p¾=¾0.742]) requires a sample size of 2336 to detect a significantdifference with 80% power at the observed effect sizes.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to report theobserved effect size comparing improvements in outcome measures between fixed andmobile bearing implant types. This study was statistically powered to detectlarge effects and descriptively analyze observed effect sizes. Based on ourresults there were no statistically or clinically meaningful differences between the fixed and mobile bearing implants when examining gait mechanics and pain1¾year after TAA.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.",RCT,,,,fixed bearing total ankle arthroplasty,mobile bearing total ankle arthroplasty,,,end-stage ankle arthritis,Walking speed,check outcome

Three patients didn't come back to the follow up visit for personalreasons. None of the patients experienced adverse events. The main outcomemeasures were T cells phenotypes, OCs precursors and inflammatory cytokines.Secondary outcome measure were clinical parameters. In eRA, 25OH vitamin D levelswere significantly lower. CD4+/IFN_+,CD4+/IL4+, CD4+/IL17A+ and CD4+IL17A+IFN_+, cells were increased in eRA as well as non-classical OCs precursors, whereas Tregulatory cells were not altered. TNF_, TGF_1, RANKL, IL-23 and IL-6 wereincreased in eRA. Non-classical OCs, IL-23 and IL-6 correlated with diseaseseverity and activity. Standard treatment with MTX and GC ameliorated clinicalsymptoms and reduced IL-23, whereas it did not affect CD4+ cells sub-sets nor OCsprecursors. After 3 months, the combined use of cholecalcipherol significantlyameliorated the effect of treatment on global health. In eRA, a significantimbalance in T CD4+ sub-types accompanied by increased levels of non-classicalOCs precursors and pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. A single dose ofcholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) combined with standard treatment significantlyameliorates patients general health.",RCT,,,,"standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX)and GCs with cholecalcipherol","standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX)and GCs without cholecalcipherol",,,early rheumatoid arthritis,T cells phenotypes,
The Anti-Migraine Effects of M2000 (_-D-Mannuronic Acid) on a Patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Case Report.,/pubmed/28578645,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and migraine are both common disorderswhich are caused by a faulty immune system and autonomic nervous systemdysfunction, respectively. Although current treatment outlook has shown a greatimprovement in these two diseases, however many side effects have been reported.CASE REPORT: We reported a case of 43-years-female that has suffered fromrheumatoid arthritis for 3 years with a 6 years history of migraine. She had useddifferent types of medication for both rheumatoid arthritis and migraine butduring these 6 years no improvement had been observed and even migraineprogression in this patient became worse. She was admitted to the hospital for 12weeks follow-up to evaluate the effect of _-D-mannuronic acid (M2000) on her RAdisease.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 12 weeks of M2000 therapy, the signs and symptomsof migraine along with RA indices including Disease Activity Score (DAS28),simple disease activity index (SDAI) and C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocytesedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinatedpeptide antibodies (anti-CCP) and blood determinants were measured.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The patient achieved a strong clinical improvement after 12 weeks of M2000 therapy in DAS28, SDAI and laboratory parameters. Moreover,M2000 showed a significant effect on the severity and the duration of migrainepain as well as times of migraine attack. In the present case, both rheumatoidarthritis and migraine as two different inflammatory diseases were diagnosed.Therefore, reducing the inflammation could be a valuable target to decrease thesigns and symptoms of migraine and rheumatoid arthritis and help to the treatmentprocess.CONCLUSION: M2000 as a novel designed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) with immunosuppressive property is able to treat migraine in addition to its potent efficacy on treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Attenuation of Follicular Helper T Cell-Dependent B Cell Hyperactivity by Abatacept Treatment in Primary Sj__gren's Syndrome.,/pubmed/28564491,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of abatacept (CTLA-4Ig), which limits T cellactivation, on homeostasis of CD4+ T cell subsets and T cell-dependent B cellhyperactivity in patients with primary Sj_gren's syndrome (SS).METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary SS treated with abatacept were included.Circulating CD4+ T cell and B cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry atbaseline, during the treatment course, and after treatment was completed. CD4+effector T cell subsets and Treg cells were identified based on expression ofCD45RA, CXCR3, CCR6, CCR4, CXCR5, programmed death 1, inducible costimulator(ICOS), and FoxP3. Serum levels of anti-SSA/anti-SSB and several T cell-relatedcytokines were measured. Expression of ICOS and interleukin-21 (IL-21) proteinwas examined in parotid gland tissue at baseline and after treatment. Changes in laboratory parameters and associations with systemic disease activity (EULARSj_gren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI]) over time were analyzed usinggeneralized estimating equations.RESULTS: Abatacept selectively reduced percentages and numbers of circulatingfollicular helper T (Tfh) cells and Treg cells. Other CD4+ effector T cellsubsets were unaffected. Furthermore, expression of the activation marker ICOS bycirculating CD4+ T cells and expression of ICOS protein in parotid gland tissuedeclined. Reduced ICOS expression on circulating Tfh cells correlatedsignificantly with lower ESSDAI scores during treatment. Serum levels of IL-21,CXCL13, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB decreased. Among circulating B cells, plasmablastswere decreased by treatment. After cessation of treatment, all parametersgradually returned to baseline.CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment in patients with primary SS reduces circulatingTfh cell numbers and expression of the activation marker ICOS on T cells. Lowernumbers of activated circulating Tfh cells contribute to attenuated Tfhcell-dependent B cell hyperactivity and may underlie the efficacy of abatacept.",Single arm,Y,,,abatacept,,,,Sj_gren's syndrome,"percentages and numbers of circulatingfollicular helper T (Tfh) cells and Treg cells",
"Cost per response for abatacept versus adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis by ACPA subgroups in Germany, Italy, Spain, US and Canada.",/pubmed/28560470,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder leading todisability and reduced quality of life. Effective treatment with biologic DMARDs poses a significant economic burden. The Abatacept versus Adalimumab Comparisonin Biologic-Na´ve RA Subjects with Background Methotrexate (AMPLE) trial was ahead-to-head, randomized study comparing abatacept in serum anti-citrullinatedprotein antibody (ACPA)-positive patients, with increasing efficacy across ACPAquartile levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost per responseaccrued using abatacept versus adalimumab in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negativepatients with RA from the health care perspective in Germany, Italy, Spain, theUS and Canada. A cost-consequence analysis (CCA) was designed to compare themonthly costs per responding patient/patient in remission. Efficacy, safety andresource use inputs were based on the AMPLE trial. A one-way deterministicsensitivity analysis (OWSA) was also performed to assess the impact of modelinputs on the results for total incremental costs. Cost per response inACPA-positive patients favoured abatacept compared with adalimumab (ACR20, ACR90 and HAQ-DI). Subgroup analysis favoured abatacept with increasing stringency ofresponse criteria and serum ACPA levels. Cost per remission (DAS28-CRP) favoured abatacept in ACPA-negative patients, while cost per CDAI and SDAI favouredabatacept in ACPA-positive patients. Abatacept was consistently favoured inACPA-Q4 patients across all outcomes and countries. Cost savings were greaterwith abatacept when more stringent response criteria were applied and also withincreasing ACPA levels, which could lead to a lower overall health care budgetimpact with abatacept compared with adalimumab.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The effects of arthritis gloves on people with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Inflammatory Arthritis with hand pain: a study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (the A-GLOVES trial).,/pubmed/28558734,"ACKGROUND: Arthritis gloves are regularly provided as part of the management of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and undifferentiated (early) inflammatoryarthritis (IA). Usually made of nylon and elastane (i.e. LycraÂ), these arthritisgloves apply pressure with the aims of relieving hand pain, stiffness andimproving hand function. However, a systematic review identified little evidence supporting their use. We therefore designed a trial to compare the effectiveness of the commonest type of arthritis glove provided in the United Kingdom (Isotonergloves) (intervention) with placebo (control) gloves (i.e. larger arthritisgloves providing similar warmth to the intervention gloves but minimal pressureonly) in people with these conditions.METHODS: Participants aged 18¾years and over with RA or IA and persistent handpain will be recruited from National Health Service Trusts in the United Kingdom.Following consent, participants will complete a questionnaire booklet, then berandomly allocated to receive intervention or placebo arthritis gloves. Withinthree weeks, they will be fitted with the allocated gloves by clinical specialistrheumatology occupational therapists. Twelve weeks (i.e. the primary endpoint)after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete a second questionnaire, including the same measures plus additional questions to exploreadherence, benefits and problems with glove-wear. A sub-sample of participantsfrom each group will be interviewed at the end of their participation to explore their views of the gloves received. The clinical effectiveness andcost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared to placebo gloves, will beevaluated over 12¾weeks. The primary outcome measure is hand pain duringactivity. Qualitative interviews will be thematically analysed.DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the commonest type of arthritis glove(Isotoner) provided in the NHS (i.e. the intervention) compared to a placeboglove. The results will help occupational therapists, occupational therapyservices and people with arthritis make informed choices as to the value ofarthritis gloves. If effective, arthritis gloves should become more widelyavailable in the NHS to help people with RA and IA manage hand symptoms andimprove performance of daily activities, work and leisure.

Myocardial Perfusion in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Associations with Traditional Risk Factors and Novel Biomarkers.,/pubmed/28553649,"Introduction. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are a major cause of death inrheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Novel biomarkers [B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP); osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) ratio; and dickkopf-1 (DKK-1)] have been used in CV risk assessment. Weanalysed, in established RA patients, the presence of silent myocardial ischemia and its association with clinical variables, BNP, and bone and atheromabiomarkers. Methods. From a single-center tertiary referral hospital, RA patientsasymptomatic for CV disease were submitted to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy(MPS) under adenosine stress and biomarkers measurements. Logistic regression wasused to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results. In 189 patients, perfusion defects were frequent (25%) and associatedwith BNP _ 100_pg/mL (OR = 5.68; 95% CI: 2.038-15.830), fourth log OPG/RANKLratio quartile (OR = 2.88; 95% CI: 1.091-7.622), and DKK-1 _ 133_pmol/L (OR =2.69; 95% CI: 1.058-6.840). Similar associations were confirmed in those withC-reactive protein > or _ 3_mg/L. No relationship was found with the majority of traditional CV factors nor with disease variables. Conclusions. Our resultscorroborated the hypothesis that MPS could reveal subclinical CV dysfunction,supported the utility of BNP measurements as a screening tool, and put inperspective the potential usefulness of complementary approaches in CV riskassessment in RA patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effects of Teriparatide on Joint Erosions in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/28544807,"OBJECTIVE: Articular erosions correlate with disability in rheumatoid arthritis(RA). Biologic agents reduce erosion progression in RA, but erosion healingoccurs infrequently. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of theanabolic agent teriparatide on joint erosion volume in RA patients treated with atumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi).METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 24 patients with erosiveRA, osteopenia, and disease activity controlled by TNFi treatment for at least 3 months. Half were randomized to receive teriparatide for 1 year and the othersconstituted a wait-list control group. Subjects and primary rheumatologists were not blinded with regard to treatment assignment, but all outcomes were assessedin a blinded manner. The primary outcome measure was change in erosion volumedetermined by computed tomography at 6 anatomic sites. Significance within eachhand and anatomic site was based on a 2-tailed test, with P values less than 0.05considered significant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were well balanced.After 52 weeks, the median change in erosion volume in the teriparatide group was-0.4 mm3 (interquartile range [IQR] -34.5, 29.6) and did not differ significantlyfrom that in controls (median change +9.1 mm3 [IQR -29.6, 26.4]) (P_=_0.28). Nosignificant difference in change in erosion volume was noted at the radius, ulna,or metacarpophalangeal joints.

Implementation of Treat-to-Target in Rheumatoid Arthritis Through a Learning Collaborative: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/28512998,"OBJECTIVE: Treat-to-target (TTT) is an accepted paradigm for the management ofrheumatoid arthritis (RA), but some evidence suggests poor adherence. The purposeof this study was to test the effects of a group-based multisite improvementlearning collaborative on adherence to TTT.METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized quality-improvement trial withwaitlist control across 11 rheumatology sites in the US. The interventionentailed a 9-month group-based learning collaborative that incorporatedrapid-cycle improvement methods. A composite TTT implementation score wascalculated as the percentage of 4 required items documented in the visit notesfor each patient at 2 time points, as evaluated by trained staff. The mean changein the implementation score for TTT across all patients for the interventionsites was compared with that for the control sites after accounting forintracluster correlation using linear mixed models.RESULTS: Five sites with a total of 23 participating rheumatology providers were randomized to intervention and 6 sites with 23 participating rheumatologyproviders were randomized to the waitlist control. The intervention included 320 patients, and the control included 321 patients. At baseline, the mean TTTimplementation score was 11% in both arms; after the 9-month intervention, themean TTT implementation score was 57% in the intervention group and 25% in thecontrol group (change in score of 46% for intervention and 14% for control;P_=_0.004).

The aim of NOR-SWITCH was to examine switching from originator infliximab to the less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 regarding efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.METHODS: The study is a randomised, non-inferiority, double-blind, phase 4 trial with 52 weeks of follow-up. Adult patients on stable treatment with infliximaboriginator treated in a hospital setting for at least 6 months were eligible for participation. Patients with informed consent were randomised in a 1:1 ratio toeither continued infliximab originator or to switch to CT-P13 treatment, withunchanged dosing regimen. Data were collected at infusion visits in 40 Norwegian study centres. Patients, assessors, and patient care providers were masked totreatment allocation. The primary endpoint was disease worsening during 52-weekfollow-up. 394 patients in the primary per-protocol set were needed to show anon-inferiority margin of 15%, assuming 30% disease worsening in each group.

Evaluation of Toll-like-receptor gene family variants as prognostic biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/28495399,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease whose main feature is persistent joint inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and influence theactivity of NF_B, a key player in chronic inflammation. We aimed at investigatingthe association of TLR allelic variants with susceptibility and severity of RAthrough a systematic, high-throughput, analysis of TLR genes. All coding exonsand flanking regions of nine members of the TLR family (TLR1-9) were analyzed in 66 patients with RA and 30 healthy controls by next generation sequencing. Wefocussed on three single allelic variants, N248S in TLR1, Q11L in TLR7 and M1V inTLR8 based on the allelic frequencies in both patient and control populations,the predicted impact on protein function and the novelty in RA research. Analysisof these selected variants in a larger cohort of 402 patients with RA and in 208 controls revealed no association with susceptibility. However, the M1V allele wasassociated with a lower need for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)(p=0.008) and biologic treatments (p=0.021). Functional studies showed that theM1V variant leads to a reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1_, IL-6 and TNF_, in response to TLR8 agonists. Thus, the presence of this variantconfers a significant protective effect on disease severity. These results showfor the first time the association between the M1V variant of TLR8 and reduceddisease severity in RA, which could have prognostic value for these patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comprehensive analysis of treatment response phenotypes in rheumatoid arthritis for pharmacogenetic studies.,/pubmed/28494788,"BACKGROUND: An individual patient's response to a particular drug is influencedby multiple factors, which may include genetic predisposition. Pharmacogeneticstudies attempt to discover and estimate the contributions of genetic variants tothe variability in response to a drug treatment. The task of identifying thegenetic contribution is often complicated by response phenotypes that are basedon imprecise or subjective clinical observations. Because the success of apharmacogenetic study depends on the analysis of a heritable phenotype, it isimportant to identify phenotypes with a significant heritable component to ensurereliable and reproducible results in subsequent genetic association studies.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data collected from 436 rheumatoid arthritispatients treated with golimumab during the phase III GO-FURTHER study. Weinvestigated the reliability of several potential response outcomes aftergolimumab treatment. Using whole-genome sequencing of the clinical trial cohort, we estimated the heritability of each potential outcome measure. We furtherperformed a longitudinal analysis of the clinical data to estimate variability ofoutcome measures over time and the degree to which each response metric could be confounded by placebo response.RESULTS: We determined that the high degree of within-patient variation over timemakes a single follow-up visit insufficient to assess an individual patient'sresponse to golimumab treatment. We found that different potential responseoutcomes had varying degrees of heritability and that averaging across multiplefollow-up visits yielded higher heritability estimates than single follow-upestimates. Importantly, we found that the change in swollen and tender jointcounts were the most heritable outcome metrics we tested; however, we showed thatthey are also more likely to be confounded by a placebo response than objectivephenotypes like the change in C-reactive protein levels.CONCLUSIONS: Our rigorous approach to finding robust and heritable responsephenotypes could be beneficial to all pharmacogenetic studies and may lead tomore reliable and reproducible results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00973479 .

In the present study, a physiologically-basedpharmacokinetic model was applied to compare the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in Japanese and Caucasians to assess the potential impact of ethnicity on thedosing regimen in the two populations. Simulated plasma concentration profilesand pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e. maximum concentration and area under plasma concentration-time curve, in Japanese and Caucasian populations after single ormultiple doses of 1 to 30 mg tofacitinib were in agreement with clinicallyobserved data. The similarity in simulated exposure between Japanese andCaucasian populations supports the currently approved dosing regimen in Japan andthe United States, where there is no recommendation for dose adjustment accordingto race. Simulated results for single (1 to 100 mg) or multiple doses (5 mg twicedaily) of tofacitinib in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19, an enzymewhich has been shown to contribute in part to tofacitinib elimination and isknown to exhibit higher frequency in Japanese compared to Caucasians, were alsoin support of no recommendation for dose adjustment in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.This study demonstrated a successful application of physiologically-basedpharmacokinetic modeling in evaluating ethnic sensitivity in pharmacokinetics at early stages of development, presenting its potential value as an efficient andscientific method for optimal dose setting in the Japanese population.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The C/T genotype and the T allele of theHIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism protected against pSS (OR = 0.22; 95% CI =0.09-0.52; P < 0.01; OR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.12-0.58; P < 0.01, resp.), whereasunder a recessive model adjusted by age and gender, the AKNA -1372C>Apolymorphism A/A genotype was associated with an increased risk of pSS (OR =2.60; 95% CI = 1.11-6.12; P = 0.03). Conclusions. We identified HIF1A Pro582Ser Tallele and C/T genotype as well as AKNA -1372C>A polymorphism A/A genotype asgenetic factors associated with pSS. Further studies in other populations areneeded to validate our findings and research is warranted in order to shed somelight on their functional implications across biological pathways in thisdisease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Tight controlled dose reduction of biologics in psoriasis patients with low disease activity: a randomized pragmatic non-inferiority trial.,/pubmed/28482858,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disorderfor which several targeted biologic therapies became available in the last10¾years. Data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that dosetapering combined with tight control of disease activity is successful. Forpsoriasis patients the lowest effective dose of biologics needs to be determined.The objective was to assess whether dose tapering of biologics guided byPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index(DLQI) scores in psoriasis patients with controlled disease activity isnon-inferior (NI) to usual care.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, non-inferioritytrial with cost- effectiveness analysis. One hundred and twenty patients withstable low disease activity (PASI___5 and DLQI___5) for at least 6¾months with a stable use of adalimumab, etanercept or ustekinumab will be randomized 1:1 to thedose reduction group or usual care. In the dose reduction group, the treatmentintervals will be prolonged stepwise, resulting in a 33% and 50% dose reduction, respectively. Disease activity is monitored every three months with PASI andDLQI. In case of flare the treatment is adjusted to the previous effective dose. The primary outcome (PASI) at 12¾months will be analyzed with ANCOVA in which thebaseline PASI will be included as covariate to gain efficiency. The secondaryoutcomes include number of and time to disease flares, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, and costs.DISCUSSION: With this study we want to assess whether disease activity guideddose reduction of biologics can be achieved for psoriasis patients with lowstable disease activity, without losing disease control. By using the lowesteffective dose of biologics, we expect to minimize side effects and save costs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02602925 ).

The Effect of Abaloparatide-SC on Fracture Risk Is Independent of Baseline FRAX Fracture Probability: A Post Hoc Analysis of the ACTIVE Study.,/pubmed/28474780,"Daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of the investigational drug abaloparatide-SC(80 mcg) for 18 months significantly decrease the risk of vertebral andnonvertebral fracture compared with placebo in postmenopausal women. We examined the efficacy of abaloparatide-SC as a function of baseline fracture risk,assessed using the FRAX tool. Baseline clinical risk factors (age, body massindex [BMI], prior fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, andsmoking) were entered into country-specific FRAX models to calculate the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures, with or without femoral neck bonemineral density (BMD). The interaction between probability of a majorosteoporotic fracture and treatment efficacy was examined by a Poissonregression. A total of 821 women randomized to placebo and 824 women toabaloparatide-SC, mean age 69 years in both groups, were followed for up to 2years. At baseline, the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (withBMD) ranged from 2.3% to 57.5% (mean 13.2%). Treatment with abaloparatide-SC was associated with a 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 38-85%) decrease in majorosteoporotic fracture (MOF) and a 43% (95% CI 9-64%) decrease in any clinicalfracture compared with placebo. For all outcomes, hazard ratios tended todecrease (ie, greater efficacy) with increasing fracture probability. Whereas theinteraction approached significance for the outcome of any fracture (p_=_0.11),there was no statistically significant interaction for any of the fractureoutcomes. Similar results were noted when FRAX probability was computed withoutBMD.

Thirtyelderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged between 60 and 70¾years wereclassified into two groups, 15 patients each. Group A received laser acupuncture therapy (904¾nm, beam area of 1cm2, power 100¾mW, power density 100¾mW/cm2,energy dosage 4¾J, energy density 4¾J/cm2, irradiation time 40¾s, and frequency100,000¾Hz). The acupuncture points that were exposed to laser radiation are LR3,ST25, ST36, SI3, SI4, LI4, LI11, SP6, SP9, GB25, GB34, and HT7. While group Breceived reflexology therapy, both offered 12 sessions over 4¾weeks. The changes in RAQoL, HAQ, IL-6, MDA, ATP, and ROM at wrist and ankle joints were measured atthe beginning and end of treatment.

Patient and Healthcare Professionals Preference for Brenzys vs. Enbrel Autoinjector for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Randomized Crossover Simulated-Use Study.,/pubmed/28417318,"INTRODUCTION: Brenzys was developed as an etanercept biosimilar of Enbrel. Theaim of this study was to assess preference and perceived ease of use for the new Brenzys autoinjector compared to the currently available marketed Enbrel MYCLICautoinjector (Australia) and Enbrel SureClick autoinjector (Canada) for thetreatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because RA affects manual dexterity, easeof use of an autoinjector is a particularly important consideration in developingeffective self-delivery of long-term courses of therapy.METHODS: Patients (N¾=¾191) reporting a diagnosis of RA and nurses andrheumatologists (N¾=¾90) with experience managing RA were shown how to useBrenzys and Enbrel autoinjectors (in counterbalanced order between participants),then they used each autoinjector by injecting into a pad simulating skin, andcompleted a questionnaire. Study sessions took place in Australia and Canada.RESULTS: A binomial test showed that significantly more patients indicated thatthe Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use than the Enbrel autoinjector (79%reporting Brenzys easier to use; p¾<¾0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [73%, 85%]). Inaddition, significantly more nurses and rheumatologists with experience managing RA also indicated that the Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use (86%;p¾<¾0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [77%, 92%) and that they would recommend thebuttonless Brenzys autoinjector over the Enbrel autoinjector to patients (83%;p¾<¾0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [74%, 90%]). Almost all patients who reported pastexperience using an Enbrel autoinjector (N¾=¾17) reported on the basis of usingthe two devices in the study that they would prefer to switch their device to theBrenzys autoinjector rather than continue their course of therapy using theEnbrel autoinjector (16/17, 94%, 95% CI [71%, 100%]).CONCLUSION: On the basis of the study results, the Brenzys autoinjector was ratedstatistically significantly easier to use, and was overall preferred by patients and healthcare professionals with experience managing RA patients.FUNDING: Merck & Co., Inc.",N,,,,,,,,,,
An open randomized active-controlled clinical trial with low-dose SKA cytokines versus DMARDs evaluating low disease activity maintenance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/28408798,"BACKGROUND: Biologic agents are currently the strongest immunosuppressive drugsable to induce remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One of the objectives ofthe medical scientific community now is how to maintain remission or low disease activity (LDA). The aim of this trial is to evaluate the contribution of low-dosesequential kinetic activation (SKA) IL-4, IL-10, and anti-IL-1 antibodies (10fg/mL) in patients affected by RA in maintaining LDA or remission obtained after biological therapy.METHOD: This is a randomized, open, active-controlled, prospective, Phase IVtrial. Disease activity score (DAS28), clinical disease activity index,simplified disease activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, global health assessment, and pain visual analog scale wereevaluated at baseline visit and then every 3 months together with an assessmentof side effects till 12 months. Thirty-nine RA patients were enrolled andrandomized to continue disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) therapy or to receive a combination of SKA low-dose cytokines formulated in concentration of10 fg/mL orally administered at a dose of 20 drops/d for 12 consecutive months.RESULTS: The rate of maintenance of LDA at 12 months was superior in the grouptreated with low-dose cytokines compared with patients treated with DMARDs, 66.7%and 42.1%, respectively; however, the difference between the groups was notstatistically significant. No side effects were reported in both groups.CONCLUSION: This is the first study using a combination of three low-dosecytokines in RA, after data published on psoriasis.

Cost-Effectiveness of TNF-Blocker Injection Spacing for Patients with Established Rheumatoid Arthritis in Remission: An Economic Evaluation from the Spacing of TNF-Blocker Injections in Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial.,/pubmed/28407999,"BACKGROUND: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission, a diseaseactivity-driven tapering of adalimumab or etanercept relying on progressiveinjection spacing has not been shown to be equivalent to a maintenance strategyat full dose in terms of disease activity in the Spacing of TNF-blockerinjections in Rheumatoid ArthritiS Study (STRASS) trial.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such a spacing strategy basedon the data of the STRASS trial.METHODS: This is a cost-utility analysis of the STRASS trial, a Frenchmulticenter 18-month equivalence randomized open-label controlled trial thatincluded patients at stable dose for at least 1 year, in remission for at least 6months. Effectiveness was assessed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs involved in the study period were assessed from a payer perspective. Thedecremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was calculated in the complete cases sample (n = 98). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted and the impact ofmissing data on DCER estimate was investigated. An acceptability analysis wasperformed.RESULTS: In the spacing arm, TNF-blockers were stopped for 34.1% of the patients,tapered for 43.2%, and maintained at full dose for 18.2%. The spacing strategywas associated with less QALYs gain (mean difference of -0.158; 95% confidenceinterval [CI] -0.085 to -0.232) and reduced costs (mean difference of -8,440;95% CI -6,507 to -10,212). The estimated DCER of the spacing strategy over themaintenance at full dose was 53,417 saved per QALY lost (95% CI 32,230 to104,700).CONCLUSIONS: The spacing strategy appears cost-effective, but the acceptabilityof such a QALY loss reported to the cost avoided remains to be evaluated, becauseno consensual threshold has been determined for willingness to accept as comparedwith willingness to pay.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this extended follow-up was to evaluatethe effects of the SARAH programme beyond 12_months.METHODS: Using postal questionnaires, we collected the Michigan HandQuestionnaire hand function (primary outcome), activities of daily living andwork subscales, pain troublesomeness, self-efficacy and health-related quality oflife. All participants were asked how often they performed hand exercises fortheir rheumatoid arthritis. Mean difference in hand function scores were analysedby a linear model, adjusted for baseline score.RESULTS: Two-thirds (n=328/490, 67%) of the original cohort provided data for theextended follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 26_months (range19-40_months).There was no difference in change in hand function scores betweenthe two groups at extended follow-up (mean difference (95% CI) 1.52 (-1.71 to4.76)). However, exercise group participants were still significantly improvedcompared with baseline (p=0.0014) unlike the best practice usual care group(p=0.1122).

Diagnostic value of a 3-day course of prednisolone in patients with possible rheumatoid arthritis - the TryCort study.,/pubmed/28388956,"BACKGROUND: In patients with tender and swollen finger joints, the differentialdiagnosis between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands can be initially difficult. This prospective study (the TryCort study) wasperformed to study the diagnostic value of prednisolone in differentiatingbetween RA and hand OA. We present the results of this potentially diagnostictest in patients with possible RA in daily clinical practice by demonstrating theresults of a pilot and a validation part of this 'prednisolone test' (pred-test).METHODS: We investigated the response to a 3-day course of 20¾mg of prednisolone in patients with suspicion of RA. All patients received 1¾g of paracetamol perday for 5¾days for pain relief. On days 3-5, a morning dose of 20¾mg ofprednisolone was added. Hand pain was quantified on a 0-10 Numerical RatingScale, and the subjective percentage of improvement (0-100%) was recorded.Thresholds for response to prednisolone were investigated in a pilot phase withdifferentiation in response between patients with RA and patients with OA of the hands, both with pain in the hands _4. In a validation phase, the bestdifferentiating cut-off of the pilot phase was applied to discriminate respondersfrom non-responders in consecutive patients with hand pain _4 referred because ofsuspected RA. Final diagnoses were made by the expert upon re-examination at week12. Primary outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of a positive test inrelation to the diagnosis.RESULTS: A percentage of 40% subjective improvement of pain in the hands on day 3discriminated best between RA and OA in the pilot phase. Among 95 patients withcomplete data in the validation phase, RA was diagnosed in about 50%. Patientswith RA had more swollen joints, higher C-reactive protein levels and slightlyhigher Health Assessment Questionnaire scores. The pred-test was positive in42.1% of all patients (40 of 95). The median percentage of improvement on day 5was higher in RA than in non-RA: 50% (IQR 30-60%) vs. 20% (IQR 10-30%)(p_<_0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the pred-test were 0.6 (95% CI0.5-0.8) and 0.8 (95% CI 0.7-0.9), respectively, and the positive and negativepredictive values were 0.77 and 0.70, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of the widely usedpred-test that has ever been performed. The pred-test had a moderate sensitivity and a good specificity.

Our study explores the durability of triple therapy(methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) versusmethotrexate-etanercept in RA.METHODS: RA patients with suboptimal response to methotrexate (n_=_353) wererandomized to either triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept therapy in a48-week, double-blinded, noninferiority trial. Patients without clinicalimprovement at 24 weeks were switched to the alternative treatment. Of the total,289 participated in followup. We report treatment durability, Disease ActivityScore in 28 joints (DAS28), and other measures during an open-label extension foran additional period up to 72 weeks.RESULTS: Mean_±_SD duration of open-label followup was 11_±_6 months. Thelikelihood of continuing conventional therapy at 1 year was 78% for tripletherapy versus 63% for methotrexate-etanercept, with most treatment changesoccurring at the start of followup. More patients changed frommethotrexate-etanercept to triple therapy than from triple therapy tomethotrexate-etanercept (P_=_0.005). DAS28 scores and other disease activitymeasures were not different for the 2 treatments and were stable during followup.CONCLUSION: In RA patients with suboptimal methotrexate response randomized toreceive triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept, the former was found to besignificantly more durable. Given cost differences and similar outcomes, thevariable durability demonstrated provides additional evidence supportingconventional combinations over biologic agent combinations as the first choiceafter methotrexate inadequate response.",RCT,,,,"methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine",methotrexate-etanercept,,,rheumatoid arthritis,Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28),
Effectiveness of integrated care including therapeutic assertive community treatment in severe schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar I disorders: Four-year follow-up of the ACCESS II study.,/pubmed/29485988,"The ACCESS-model offers integrated care including assertive community treatmentto patients with psychotic disorders. ACCESS proved more effective compared tostandard care (ACCESS-I study) and was successfully implemented into clinicalroutine (ACCESS-II study). In this article, we report the 4-year outcomes of the ACCESS-II study. Between May 2007 and December 2013, 115 patients receivedcontinuous ACCESS-care. We hypothesized that the low 2-year disengagement andhospitalization rates and significant improvements in psychopathology,functioning, and quality of life could be sustained over 4 years. Over 4 years,only 10 patients disengaged from ACCESS. Another 23 left for practical reasonsand were successfully transferred to other services. Hospitalization ratesremained low (13.0% in year 3; 9.1% in year 4). Involuntary admissions decreased from 35% in the 2 years prior to ACCESS to 8% over 4 years in ACCESS. Outpatient contacts remained stably high at 2.0-2.4 per week. We detected significantimprovements in psychopathology (effect size d = 0.79), illness severity (d =1.29), level of functioning (d = 0.77), quality of life (d = 0.47) and stablyhigh client satisfaction (d = 0.02) over 4 years. Most positive effects wereobserved within the first 2 years with the exception of illness severity, whichfurther improved from year 2 to 4. Within continuous intensive 4-yearACCESS-care, sustained improvements in psychopathology, functioning, quality oflife, low service disengagement and re-hospitalization rates, as well as lowrates of involuntary treatment, were observed in contrast to other studies, whichreported a decline in these parameters once a specific treatment model wasstopped. Yet, stronger evidence to prove these results is required.TRIALREGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT01888627.",Single arm,Y,,,ACCESS-care,,,,psychotic disorders,Hospitalization rates,
"The Effect of a Brief Cognitive Behavioural Stress Management Programme on Mental Status, Coping with Stress Attitude and Caregiver Burden While Caring for Schizophrenic Patients.",/pubmed/29413060,"This experimental study was carried out using a pre-test/post-test control group model to evaluate the effect of a ""Brief Cognitive Behavioural Stress Management Programme"" (BCBSMP) on mental status, coping with stress attitude, and caregiver burden while caring for patients with schizophrenia. A total of 61 caregivers whoprovided care for schizophrenia patients at a community mental health centre wereincluded in the study. Caregivers were matched according to gender and scalescores and were assigned to either the study or the control group. Before andafter the programme, caregivers in both groups were given the ""Demografic DataForm"", ""Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale"", ""Coping Attitude Evaluation Scale"",""Stress Indicators Scale"", and the ""General Health Survey-28"". Caregivers in the study group were taken to a BCSMP one session per week (each session lasted120min) for seven weeks. We determined that the stress indicators, the risk ofdeveloping a psychological disorder, and caregiver burden decreased and skillsrelated to both the problem-oriented and emotion-oriented aspects of stressincreased in the study group after the programme.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Comparison of Criminal Characteristics in Depression Patients and Schizophrenics with Homicide Behavior].,/pubmed/29230987,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the criminal characteristics of forensic psychiatryexpertise in depression patients and schizophrenics with homicide behavior.METHODS: A total of 40 depression _depressive episode_ patients and 50schizophrenics with homicide behavior were randomly assigned into the study groupand control group, respectively. Data of demographic and criminal characteristic of the two groups were collected by a self-designed questionnaire, and then were compared.RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in age, education level and careerbetween study and control groups _P>0.05_. Compared with the control group, thevictims in the study group were mainly the patient's children and parents, andmost offenders had suicidal behavior after homicide _70%_. In study group, themotives of crime were mainly extended suicide and indirect suicide, and mostoffenders had attempted suicide _85%_ and diminished capacity of criminalresponsibility _70%_, which in control group had no capacity of criminalresponsibility _56%_. Except for criminal site, there were statisticaldifferences in other criminal characteristics between two groups _P<0.05_.CONCLUSIONS: There are different criminal characteristics between depressionpatients and schizophrenics with homicide behavior in forensic psychiatry, andthese characteristics should be considered when these two diagnoses aredistinguished in forensic psychiatry expertise.",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Negative Symptoms and Avoidance of Social Interaction: A Study of Non-Verbal Behaviour.,/pubmed/29224023,"BACKGROUND: Non-verbal behaviour is fundamental to social interaction. Patientswith schizophrenia display an expressivity deficit of non-verbal behaviour,exhibiting behaviour that differs from both healthy subjects and patients withdifferent psychiatric diagnoses. The present study aimed to explore theassociation between non-verbal behaviour and symptom domains, overcomingmethodological shortcomings of previous studies.SAMPLING AND METHODS: Standardised interviews with 63 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia were videotaped. Symptoms were assessed using the ClinicalAssessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), the Positive and NegativeSyndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale. Independent raters lateranalysed the videos for non-verbal behaviour, using a modified version of theEthological Coding System for Interviews (ECSI).RESULTS: Patients with a higher level of negative symptoms displayedsignificantly fewer prosocial (e.g., nodding and smiling), gesture, anddisplacement behaviours (e.g., fumbling), but significantly more flightbehaviours (e.g., looking away, freezing). No gender differences were found, and these associations held true when adjusted for antipsychotic medication dosage.CONCLUSIONS: Negative symptoms are associated with both a lower level of activelyengaging non-verbal behaviour and an increased active avoidance of socialcontact. Future research should aim to identify the mechanisms behind flightbehaviour, with implications for the development of treatments to improve social functioning.",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Potential diagnostic markers of olanzapine efficiency for acute psychosis: a focus on peripheral biogenic amines.,/pubmed/29221470,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are now widely used in many fields of medicine, and theidentification of biomarkers that predict antipsychotic efficacy and adversereactions is a growing area of psychiatric research. Monoamine molecules of theperipheral bloodstream are possible prospective biomarkers based on a growingbody of evidence indicating that they may reflect specific changes inneurotransmitters in the brain. The aim of this study was to detect peripheralbiogenic amine indicators of patients with acute psychosis and to test thecorrelations between the biological measures studied and the psychopathologicalstatus of the patients.METHODS: This research included 60 patients with acute psychosis treated witholanzapine (n_=_30) or haloperidol (n_=_30). Here, we measured biogenic amineindicators, including mRNA levels of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and theserotonin 2A receptor (5HTR2A), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum dopamineconcentrations by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Psychopathologicalstatus was evaluated using psychometric scales. The assessments were conductedprior to and after 14 and 28¾days of treatment.RESULTS: The administration of haloperidol, but not olanzapine, up-regulated5HTR2A mRNA in a linear manner, albeit without statistical significance(p_=_0.052). Both drugs had non-significant effects on DRD4 mRNA levels.Nevertheless, a positive correlation was found between DRD4 and 5HTR2A mRNAlevels over a longitudinal trajectory, suggesting co-expression of the two genes.A significant positive correlation was observed between 5HTR2A mRNA levels andtotal Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores in both groups ofpatients before treatment. A significant correlation between baseline 5HTR2A mRNAlevels and PANSS scores on days 14 and 28 of treatment remained for patientstreated with olanzapine only. Moreover, a significant positive correlation wasobserved between blood serum dopamine levels and scores on extrapyramidal symptomscales in the olanzapine group.CONCLUSIONS: The DRD4 and 5HTR2A genes are co-expressed in PBMCs duringantipsychotic administration. Despite a correlation between the studied biogenic amine indicators and the psychopathological status of patients, reliablebiomarkers of treatment response could not be determined.",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Pilot randomised controlled trial of culturally adapted cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis (CaCBTp) in Pakistan.,/pubmed/29207980,"BACKGROUND: Evidence for efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) intreatment of schizophrenia is growing. CBT is effective and cost efficient intreating positive and negative symptoms. To effectively meet the needs of diversecultural groups, CBT needs to be adapted to the linguistic, cultural andsocioeconomic context. We aimed to assess the feasibility, efficacy andacceptability of a culturally adapted CBT for treatment of psychosis (CaCBTp) in a low-income country.METHODS: Rater-blind, randomised, controlled trial of the use of standardduration CBT in patients with psychosis from a low-income country. Participantswith a ICD-10 diagnosis of psychosis were assessed using Positive and NegativeSyndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales(PSYRATS), and the Schedule for Assessment of Insight (SAI) (baseline, 3¾monthsand 6¾months). They were randomized into the intervention group (n_=_18) andTreatment As Usual (TAU) group (n_=_18). The intervention group received 12weekly sessions of CaCBTp.RESULTS: The CaCBTp group had significantly lower scores on PANSS Positive(p_=_0.02), PANSS Negative (p_=_0.045), PANSS General Psychopathology (p_=_0.008)and Total PANSS (p_=_0.05) when compared to TAU at three months. They also hadlow scores on Delusion Severity Total (p_=_0.02) and Hallucination Severity Total(p_=_0.04) of PSYRATS, as well as higher scores on SAI (p_=_0.01) at the sametime point. At six months only the improvement in PANSS positive scores(p_=_0.045) met statistical significance..CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to offer CaCBTp as an adjunct to TAU in patients withpsychosis, presenting to services in a lower middle-income country.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02202694 (Retrospectivelyregistered).",RCT,,,,,,,,,,
Once-monthly injection of paliperidone palmitate in patients with recently diagnosed and chronic schizophrenia: a post-hoc comparison of efficacy and safety.,/pubmed/29141463,"BACKGROUND: The use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in recentlydiagnosed schizophrenia remains less explored. We evaluated the efficacy andsafety of paliperidone palmitate once-monthly (PP1M) treatment in adult patients with recently diagnosed vs. chronic schizophrenia.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: These post-hoc analyses included two multicenterstudies. Study 1 (NCT01527305) enrolled recently diagnosed (_5¾years) and chronic(>5¾years) patients; Study 2 (NCT01051531) enrolled recently diagnosed patientsonly. Recently diagnosed patients were further sub-grouped into _2¾years or2-5¾years. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in Positiveand Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score.RESULTS: In Study 1, 41.5% patients had recent diagnosis (_2¾years: 56.8%;2-5¾years: 43.2%); 58.5% had chronic schizophrenia. In Study 2, 52.8% and 47.2%patients were grouped into _2¾years and 2-5¾years, respectively. PANSS totalscore showed significantly greater improvement in patients with recentlydiagnosed vs. chronic schizophrenia. Similar results were obtained for PANSSresponder rate, improvements in PANSS, and CGI-S scores.CONCLUSION: PP1M was efficacious in both recently diagnosed and chronicschizophrenia, with the benefits being more pronounced in patients with recently diagnosed schizophrenia.

"An interactive sports video game as an intervention for rehabilitation of community-living patients with schizophrenia: A controlled, single-blind, crossover study.",/pubmed/29131826,"Hypofrontality is a state of decreased cerebral blood flow in the prefrontalcortex during executive function performance; it is commonly observed in patientswith schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction, as well as the psychological symptoms of schizophrenia, influences the ability of patients to reintegrate into society.The current study investigated the effects of an interactive sports video game(IVG; Nintendo WiiÈ Sports Resort) on frontal lobe function of patients withschizophrenia. A sample of eight patients (6 male and 2 female; mean age = 46.7years, standard deviation (SD) = 13.7) engaged in an IVG every week for 3 months in a controlled, single-blind, crossover study. Before and after the interventionwe examined frontal lobe blood-flow volume using functional near-infraredspectroscopy (fNIRS), and assessed functional changes using the FrontalAssessment Battery, Health-Related Quality of Life scale, andbehaviorally-assessed physical function tests. fNIRS revealed that prefrontalactivity during IVG performance significantly increased in the IVG periodcompared with the control period. Furthermore, significant correlations betweencerebral blood flow changes in different channels were observed during IVGperformance. In addition, we observed intervention-related improvement inhealth-related quality of life following IVG. IVG intervention was associatedwith increased prefrontal cortex activation and improved health-related qualityof life performance in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with chronicschizophrenia are characterized by withdrawal and a lack of social responsivenessor interest in others.

Effectiveness of Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) versus standard occupational therapy for activity engagement and functioning among people with mental illness - a cluster RCT study.,/pubmed/29121882,"BACKGROUND: Many with a mental illness have an impoverished everyday life withfew meaningful activities and a sedentary lifestyle. The study aim was toevaluate the effectiveness of the 16-week Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) program, compared to care as usual (CAU), for people with mental illness in specializedand community-based psychiatric services. The main outcomes concerned differentaspects of subjectively evaluated everyday activities, in terms of the engagementand satisfaction they bring, balance among activities, and activity level.Secondary outcomes pertained to various facets of well-being and functioning. It was hypothesized that those who received the BEL intervention would improve more than the comparison group regarding activity, well-being and functioningoutcomes.METHODS: BEL is a group and activity-based lifestyle intervention. CAU entailedactive support, mainly standard occupational therapy. The BEL group included 133 participants and the CAU group 93. They completed self-report questionnairestargeting activity and well-being on three occasions - at baseline, aftercompleted intervention (at 16¾weeks) and at a six-month follow-up. A researchassistant rated the participants' level of functioning and symptom severity onthe same occasions. Non-parametric statistics were used since these instrumentsproduced ordinal data.RESULTS: The BEL group improved more than the CAU group from baseline to 16¾weekson primary outcomes in terms of activity engagement (p¾<¾0.001), activity level(p¾=¾0.036) and activity balance (p¾<¾0.042). The BEL group also improved more onthe secondary outcomes of symptom severity (p¾<¾0.018) and level of functioning(p¾<¾0.046) from baseline to 16¾weeks, but not on well-being. High intra-classcorrelations (0.12-0.22) indicated clustering effects for symptom severity andlevel of functioning. The group differences on activity engagement (p¾=¾0.001)and activity level (p¾=¾0.007) remained at the follow-up. The BEL group alsoimproved their well-being (quality of life) more than the CAU group from baselineto the follow-up (p¾=¾0.049). No differences were found at that time for activitybalance, level of functioning and symptom severity.CONCLUSION: The BEL program was effective compared to CAU in terms of activityengagement. Their improvements were not, however, greater concerning othersubjective perceptions, such as satisfaction with daily activities and self-ratedhealth, and clustering effects lowered the dependability regarding findings ofimprovements on symptoms and functioning. Although the CAU group had ""caught up"" at the follow-up, the BEL group had improved more on general quality of life. BELappeared to be important in shortening the time required for participants todevelop their engagement in activity and in attaining improved quality of life ina follow-up perspective.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov.

Fifteen of the 16 subjects underwent 3-Teslamagnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: Oxytocin significantly reduced scores on the positive and negativesyndrome scale, especially on the negative symptoms. As for cognition, there was an improvement of the verbal fluency. Furthermore, the change of the negativescore in positive and negative syndrome scale showed a negative correlation with the gray matter volumes of the right insula and left cingulate cortex.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that daily administration of intranasaloxytocin may be effective for ameliorating clinical symptoms and cognitivefunctions in chronic schizophrenia patients, and this improvement may be related to the gray matter volume of the right insula and left cingulate cortex.",Single arm,Y,,,oxytocin,,,,schizophrenia,positive and negative syndrome scale,

Risk factors for readmission in schizophrenia patients following involuntary admission.,/pubmed/29073180,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia who are involuntarily admitted mayhave poorer prognosis, including higher readmission rates, than those voluntarilyadmitted. However, little is known about the risk factors for readmission inthose schizophrenia patients who are involuntarily admitted.AIMS: We aim to explore the risk factors for readmission in this population.METHOD: We enrolled 138 schizophrenia patients with involuntary admission fromJuly 2008 to June 2013 and followed those patients for readmission outcomes at 3 months and at 1 year.RESULTS: The one-year and 3-months readmission rates were 33.3% and 15.2%,respectively. Unmarried status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.28, 95% CI:1.48-26.62), previous history of involuntary admission (aOR = 4.08, 95% CI:1.19-14.02), longer involuntary admission days (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07)and shorter total admission days (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission. Younger age (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI1.02-1.18) was associated with increased risk for 3-months readmission.CONCLUSIONS: Unmarried status, prior history of involuntary admission, longerinvoluntary admission days and shorter total admission days were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission.

An investigation of regional cerebral blood flow and tissue structure changes after acute administration of antipsychotics in healthy male volunteers.,/pubmed/29058358,"Chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs has been linked to structural brainchanges observed in patients with schizophrenia. Recent MRI studies have shownrapid changes in regional brain volume following just a single dose of thesedrugs. However, it is not clear if these changes represent real volume changes orare artefacts (""apparent"" volume changes) due to drug-induced physiologicalchanges, such as increased cerebral blood flow (CBF). To address this, weexamined the effects of a single, clinical dose of three commonly prescribedantipsychotics on quantitative measures of T1 and regional blood flow of thehealthy human brain. Males (n_=_42) were randomly assigned to one of two parallelgroups in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-period cross-overstudy design. One group received a single oral dose of either 0.5 or 2_mg ofrisperidone or placebo during each visit. The other received olanzapine (7.5_mg),haloperidol (3_mg), or placebo. MR measures of quantitative T1, CBF, andT1-weighted images were acquired at the estimated peak plasma concentration ofthe drug. All three drugs caused localized increases in striatal blood flow,although drug and region specific effects were also apparent. In contrast, allassessments of T1 and brain volume remained stable across sessions, even in thoseareas experiencing large changes in CBF. This illustrates that a singleclinically relevant oral dose of an antipsychotic has no detectable acute effect on T1 in healthy volunteers. We further provide a methodology for applyingquantitative imaging methods to assess the acute effects of other compounds onstructural MRI metrics.

Stimulating thought: a functional MRI study of transcranial direct current stimulation in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29050384,"Individuals with schizophrenia typically suffer a range of cognitive deficits,including prominent deficits in working memory and executive function. Thesedifficulties are strongly predictive of functional outcomes, but there is apaucity of effective therapeutic interventions targeting these deficits.Transcranial direct current stimulation is a novel neuromodulatory technique withemerging evidence of potential pro-cognitive effects; however, there is limitedunderstanding of its mechanism. This was a double-blind randomized shamcontrolled pilot study of transcranial direct current stimulation on a workingmemory (n-back) and executive function (Stroop) task in 28 individuals withschizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Study participantsreceived 30 min of real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation appliedto the left frontal cortex. The 'real' and 'sham' groups did not differ in onlineworking memory task performance, but the transcranial direct current stimulation group demonstrated significant improvement in performance at 24 hpost-transcranial direct current stimulation. Transcranial direct currentstimulation was associated with increased activation in the medial frontal cortexbeneath the anode; showing a positive correlation with consolidated workingmemory performance 24 h post-stimulation. There was reduced activation in theleft cerebellum in the transcranial direct current stimulation group, with nochange in the middle frontal gyrus or parietal cortices. Improved performance on the executive function task was associated with reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. Transcranial direct current stimulation modulated functionalactivation in local task-related regions, and in more distal nodes in thenetwork. Transcranial direct current stimulation offers a potential novelapproach to altering frontal cortical activity and exerting pro-cognitive effectsin schizophrenia.",RCT,,,,Transcranial direct current stimulation, sham transcranial direct current stimulation,,,schizophrenia,,check outcome

Tolcapone-Enhanced Neurocognition in Healthy Adults: Neural Basis and Predictors.,/pubmed/29020372,"Background: Failure of procognitive drug trials in schizophrenia may reflect the clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia, underscoring the need to identifybiomarkers of treatment sensitivity. We used an experimental medicine design totest the procognitive effects of a putative procognitive agent, tolcapone, using an electroencephalogram-based cognitive control task in healthy subjects.Methods: Healthy men and women (n=27; ages 18-35 years), homozygous for eitherthe Met/Met or Val/Val rs4680 genotype, received placebo and tolcapone 200 mgorally across 2 test days separated by 1 week in a double-blind, randomized,counterbalanced, within-subject design. On each test day, neurocognitiveperformance was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and anelectroencephalogram-based 5 Choice-Continuous Performance Test.Results: Tolcapone enhanced visual learning in low-baseline MATRICS ConsensusCognitive Battery performers (d=0.35) and had an opposite effect in highperformers (d=0.5), and enhanced verbal fluency across all subjects (P=.03) buthad no effect on overall MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery performance.Tolcapone reduced false alarm rate (d=0.8) and enhanced frontal P200 amplitudeduring correctly identified nontarget trials (d=0.6) in low-baseline 5Choice-Continuous Performance Test performers and had opposite effects in highperformers (d=0.5 and d=0.25, respectively). Tolcapone's effect on frontal P200amplitude and false alarm rate was correlated (rs=-0.4, P=.05). Allneurocognitive effects of tolcapone were independent of rs4680 genotype.Conclusion: Tolcapone enhanced neurocognition and engaged electroencephalogrammeasures relevant to cognitive processes in specific subgroups of healthyindividuals. These findings support an experimental medicine model foridentifying procognitive treatments and provide a strong basis for futurebiomarker-informed procognitive studies in schizophrenia patients.",RCT,,,,tolcapone,placebo,,,Healthy men and women ,"MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and anelectroencephalogram-based 5 Choice-Continuous Performance Test",
Clinically relevant response and remission outcomes in cariprazine-treated patients with bipolar I disorder.,/pubmed/29017067,"BACKGROUND: Rates of response and remission are measures that endorse theclinical significance of treatment. Cariprazine is FDA approved for the acutetreatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Post hoc analyses of pooled data from 3 pivotal trials ofcariprazine in manic/mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder wereconducted to investigate the effect of cariprazine on various criteria ofresponse and remission.METHODS: The constituent studies were 3-week randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group phase II/III studies in adultpatients (age 18-65 years) with bipolar I disorder (NCT00488618, NCT01058096,NCT01058668). Post hoc analyses included Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) outcomesfor response (_50% decrease in score), remission (total score _12 and _8),cumulative remission, and global improvement. Additionally, composite remission(YMRS total score _12 plus Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale total score _12) and worsening/switch to depression (MADRS total score _15) by week wereinvestigated.RESULTS: Rates of response and remission were significantly greater forcariprazine versus placebo on every measure evaluated (P < .01 all analyses); theestimated number needed to treat for each measure was _10. There was no evidence of worsening/switch to depression.LIMITATIONS: Post hoc analyses, short treatment duration, no active comparator.DISCUSSION: Cariprazine-treated patients with bipolar I disorder attainedclinically significant improvement in manic symptoms as shown by significantlygreater rates of response and remission versus placebo; improvement in manicsymptoms did not induce depressive symptoms.",RCT,,,,Cariprazine,placebo,,,bipolar I disorder,"Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) outcomesfor response",
A randomized waitlist control community study of Social Cognition and Interaction Training for people with schizophrenia.,/pubmed/28990190,"OBJECTIVE: Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT) has demonstratedeffectiveness in improving social cognition and functioning of people withschizophrenia. This pilot study examines the acceptability, feasibility, andeffectiveness of SCIT with individuals who have schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and are receiving care through a public mental health service.METHOD: In a pragmatic randomized waitlist controlled trial, 36 participants(aged 19-55¾years) with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were randomly allocatedto SCIT or treatment as usual (TAU). Measures of theory of mind, emotionperception, attributional bias, social skills, quality of life, life skills,depression, anxiety, and stress were administered pre- and post-intervention withfollow-up conducted 4¾months later. All wait-list controls subsequently received the intervention and a secondary within-group analysis was conducted includingthese participants.RESULTS: While no significant differences were found between groups on anyoutcomes, there was strong engagement with the SCIT intervention. Of the 21participants in the intervention group, the completion rate was 85.71% with amedian attendance rate of 17 sessions. Within subject analyses of SCITparticipants over time showed significant improvements in quality of life,emotion recognition, social skills, and a trend towards better life skills frompre- to post-intervention. These gains were sustained at the 4-month follow-uptime.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Although this study showed limitedbenefits in outcomes associated with SCIT compared with TAU, it demonstrated the acceptability of SCIT to participants in a real world public health setting shownby high retention, attendance, and positive feedback. This pilot shows SCIT canbe implemented in routine clinical practice and lays the foundation for a larger pragmatic study.PRACTITIONER POINTS: SCIT can be implemented successfully in a real-worldcommunity mental health setting. SCIT had high levels of acceptability to theseparticipants. Limitations The small sample size meant there was insufficientpower to detect differences between groups on outcome measures. The study did notinclude measures of psychiatric symptoms or neuropsychological functioning which may have influenced participants' capacity to benefit from SCIT.",RCT,,,,Social Cognition and Interaction Training,treatment as usual,,,schizophrenia spectrum disorder,"theory of mind, emotion perception",
Effect of lifestyle coaching versus care coordination versus treatment as usual in people with severe mental illness and overweight: Two-years follow-up of the randomized CHANGE trial.,/pubmed/28985228,"The objective of this trial was to assess the long-term effect of the CHANGElifestyle coaching intervention for 428 people with abdominal obesity andschizophrenia spectrum disorders on cardiovascular risk. In this randomized,superiority, multi-center clinical trial, participants were randomized to 12months of either lifestyle coaching plus care coordination (N = 138), carecoordination alone, (N = 142) or treatment as usual (N = 148). There was noeffect after 12 months, but we hypothesized that there might have been a delayed treatment effect. Our primary outcome at two-year follow-up was 10-year risk ofcardiovascular disease standardized to 60 years of age. After two-years the mean 10-year cardiovascular-disease risk was 8.7% (95% confidence interval (CI)7.6-9.9%) in the CHANGE group, 7.7% (95% CI 6.5-8.9%) in the care coordinationgroup, and 8.9% (95% CI 6.9-9.2%) in the treatment as usual group (P = 0.24).Also, there were no intervention effects for any secondary or exploratoryoutcomes, including cardiorespiratory fitness, weight, physical activity, dietand smoking. No reported adverse events could be ascribed to the intervention.

"Late Reduction of Cocaine Cravings in a Randomized, Double-Blind Trial of Aripiprazole vs Perphenazine in Schizophrenia and Comorbid Cocaine Dependence.",/pubmed/28984746,"PURPOSE: Co-occurring schizophrenia spectrum disorder and InternationalStatistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision cocaine dependence present a particularly destructive constellation that is often difficult to treat. Bothconditions raise dopamine transmission effects in the brain. Traditionalneuroleptics block dopamine receptors, whereas aripiprazole modulates dopamineactivity as an agonist/antagonist. We tested whether dopamine modulation issuperior to dopamine blocking in dual-diagnosis patients.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, comparison design, cocaine-dependentschizophrenic subjects actively using cocaine received either aripiprazole orperphenazine in an 8-week trial. Primary outcome targeted cocaine-free urinesample proportions, whereas cocaine craving scores were a secondary variable.RESULTS: Subjects (N = 44) randomized (n = 22 per group) did not differ atbaseline. The proportion of cocaine-free urine samples did not differ bymedication group. Contrasting weeks 3 to 5 vs 6 to 8 revealed significant latereductions in craving with aripiprazole. On the respective 5-point subscales,craving intensity decreased by 1.53 ± 0.43 (P < 0.0005) points, craving frequencyby 1.4 ± 0.40 (P > 0.0004) points, and craving duration by 1.76 ± 0.44 (P >0.0001) points.CONCLUSIONS: A drug effect of aripiprazole on craving items appeared at week 6 oftreatment, on average, and was not seen before that length of drug exposure. The data suggest that dopamine modulation reduces cocaine cravings but requires anacclimation period. To understand the mechanism of action better, a trial ofdepot aripiprazole may be useful. Clinically, a reduction in craving potentially offers a clearer focus for ongoing behavioral treatment. It may also offer alonger-term treatment effect with respect to the severity of relapse.",RCT,,,,aripiprazole,perphenazine,,,cocaine-dependent schizophrenic subjects,targeted cocaine-free urine sample proportions,
TAILOR - tapered discontinuation versus maintenance therapy of antipsychotic medication in patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia or persistent delusional disorder in remission of psychotic symptoms: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.,/pubmed/28962668,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the TAILOR trial is to investigate the effect of closelymonitored tapering/discontinuation versus maintenance therapy with antipsychotic medication in patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia or persistentdelusional disorder and with minimum 3¾months' remission of psychotic symptoms.METHODS AND DESIGN: Two hundred and fifty patients will be included from thepsychiatric early intervention program, OPUS, in two regions in Denmark.Inclusion criteria are: ICD-10 diagnoses schizophrenia (F20, except F20.6) orpersistent delusional disorder (F22), minimum 3¾months' remission of psychoticsymptoms and in treatment with antipsychotic medication (except clozapine). Thepatients will be randomized to maintenance therapy or tapering/discontinuationwith antipsychotic medication in a 1-year intervention. Thetapering/discontinuation group will be using a smartphone application to monitor early warning signs of psychotic relapse. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 1-, 2- and 5-year follow-up regarding psychotic and negative symptoms,side-effects of antipsychotic medication, social functioning, cognitivefunctioning, perceived health status, patient satisfaction, substance and alcoholuse, sexual functioning and quality of life. The primary outcome will beremission of psychotic symptoms and no antipsychotic medication after 1¾year.Secondary outcome measures will include: co-occurrence of remission of psychotic symptoms and 0-1-mg haloperidol equivalents of antipsychotic medication after1-year intervention; antipsychotic dose; antipsychotic side effects; negativesymptoms; social functioning; cognitive functioning; and patient satisfaction.Exploratory outcomes will include remission, clinical recovery, substance andalcohol use, sexual functioning, quality of life, self-beliefs of coping and userexperience of support from health workers. Safety measures will include death,admissions to psychiatric hospital, severe self-harm and psychotic relapses.DISCUSSION: The TAILOR trial will contribute knowledge about the effect oftapering/discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in the early phases ofschizophrenia and related disorders and the results may guide future clinicaltreatment regimens of antipsychotic treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register - EudraCT number: 2016-000565-23 .

Risperidone versus olanzapine among patients with schizophrenia participating in supported employment: Eighteen-month outcomes.,/pubmed/28942217,"This study compares the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine versusrisperidone among patients with schizophrenia who are established in outpatientpsychiatric care and entering supported employment. A multicenter, randomized,double-blind trial was conducted among 107 outpatients with schizophrenia, whowere cross-titrated to flexible dose risperidone or olanzapine over 2 weeks.Clinical endpoints included time to hospitalization and persistence on assignedmedication. Weight, laboratory tests, psychopathology, neurologic side effects,social adjustment and role functioning were assessed at 3-6 month intervals. Datawere analyzed first by randomized treatment, and then reassessed controlling for prior medication treatment. The proportion of patients on assigned medication at 18 months was 30.9% for risperidone and 37.3% for olanzapine. Mean doses were6.4¾±¾3.2¾mg daily for risperidone, and 17.0¾±¾5.0¾mg daily for olanzapine. Thegroups did not differ significantly in time to medication discontinuation, first hospitalization or first employment. There were few differences inpsychopathology, laboratory, or neurological assessments between groups at 18months. Patients randomized to olanzapine gained modestly more weight.Controlling for pre-randomization medication suggested improvement in someaspects of psychopathology from switching medications; however, switching fromolanzapine to risperidone was associated with more hospitalizations. Risperidone and olanzapine have similar efficacy and tolerability in patients withschizophrenia who are participating in supported employment. Randomization toolanzapine was associated with more weight gain, but randomization fromolanzapine to risperidone appeared to be associated with a greater likelihood of hospitalization. Careful monitoring of metabolic effects and participation insupported employment may have contributed to minimal weight gain and metaboliceffects.",RCT,,,,olanzapine,risperidone,,,schizophrenia,time to hospitalization,
Durability of Therapeutic Response With Long-Term Aripiprazole Lauroxil Treatment Following Successful Resolution of an Acute Episode of Schizophrenia.,/pubmed/28937706,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate durability of therapeutic effect of long-term treatmentwith aripiprazole lauroxil in patients with schizophrenia following successfultreatment of an acute psychotic episode.METHODS: This post hoc analysis assessed long-term outcomes for a subgroup ofpatients who entered a 52-week extension study after being successfullystabilized with one of 2 doses of aripiprazole lauroxil (441 or 882 mg) in apivotal 12-week, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Durability oftherapeutic effect was measured by the proportion of patients completing the1-year course of aripiprazole lauroxil, the trajectories of the Positive andNegative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity(CGI-S) item scores beyond the first 12 weeks, and the likelihood of remission atany follow-up point.RESULTS: In total, 181 patients treated with aripiprazole lauroxil entered theextension study; 73% and 66% of patients from the 441 mg and 882 mg groups,respectively, completed all 13 aripiprazole lauroxil treatments scheduled every 4weeks over 52 weeks. Both groups continued on a positive trajectory of symptomimprovements (P < .0001 for reductions in PANSS total and CGI-S scores from week 12 to end of follow-up). Most patients (74% and 68% in the aripiprazole lauroxil 441 mg and 882 mg groups, respectively) achieved remission during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: These post hoc analyses of a subgroup of patients demonstrate thecontinued therapeutic efficacy of aripiprazole lauroxil after successfultreatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia.

Topiramate's effectiveness on weight reduction in overweight/obese persons with schizophrenia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28931411,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with a higher mortality than that of the general population. Most of the deaths are due to cardiovascularcauses and are related to metabolic risks. This risk is due not only toantipsychotics but also to inherent factors of the disorder. Studies in the West have shown topiramate to be effective in schizophrenia to reduce weight gain and for symptomatic control. Whether this is effective for South Asians is not known.It is important because South Asians have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. Weaim to conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing topiramateadd-on therapy with treatment as usual with antipsychotics in patients withschizophrenia in an outpatient setting in Sri Lanka.METHODS/DESIGN: Ninety patients with schizophrenia presenting to the ColomboNorth Teaching Hospital will be randomized to intervention and control groupsequally using permuted block randomization. Patients with comorbid metabolicdisorders and taking prescribed weight-controlling medications will be excluded. The intervention group will be prescribed topiramate in addition to theirantipsychotics in a predefined dosing regimen targeting a dose of 100¾mg per day.The control subjects are to receive a placebo. As the primary outcome,anthropometric measurements including weight, waist circumference, skinfoldthickness, and body mass index will be recorded at baseline and monthly duringthe study period of 3¾months. The secondary outcome is the change in symptomsaccording to the clinician-administered Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.Assessment of capacity will be performed and informed consent obtained from allsubjects. Ethics approval has been obtained from the ethical review committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, and the trial has beenregistered in the Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry.DISCUSSION: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we will attempt toassess the effectiveness of topiramate as an add-on therapy compared withtreatment as usual for weight control in patients with schizophrenia. To ourknowledge, this is the first such study in South Asia, where metabolic risks are found to be higher than in the West and could have unique ethnic factors related to weight gain in schizophrenia.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry, SLCTR/2017/003 .Registered on 20 February 2017.

"Amisulpride augmentation in clozapine-unresponsive schizophrenia (AMICUS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.",/pubmed/28869006,"BACKGROUND: When treatment-refractory schizophrenia shows an insufficientresponse to a trial of clozapine, clinicians commonly add a second antipsychotic,despite the lack of robust evidence to justify this practice.OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the study were to establish the clinicaleffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of augmentation of clozapine medication witha second antipsychotic, amisulpride, for the management of treatment-resistantschizophrenia.DESIGN: The study was a multicentre, double-blind, individually randomised,placebo-controlled trial with follow-up at 12 weeks.SETTINGS: The study was set in NHS multidisciplinary teams in adult psychiatry.PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were people aged 18-65 years withtreatment-resistant schizophrenia unresponsive, at a criterion level ofpersistent symptom severity and impaired social function, to an adequate trial ofclozapine monotherapy.INTERVENTIONS: Interventions comprised clozapine augmentation over 12 weeks with amisulpride or placebo. Participants received 400_mg of amisulpride or twomatching placebo capsules for the first 4 weeks, after which there was a clinicaloption to titrate the dosage of amisulpride up to 800_mg or four matching placebocapsules for the remaining 8 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of'responders', using a criterion response threshold of a 20% reduction in totalscore on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.RESULTS: A total of 68 participants were randomised. Compared with theparticipants assigned to placebo, those receiving amisulpride had a greaterchance of being a responder by the 12-week follow-up (odds ratio 1.17, 95%confidence interval 0.40 to 3.42) and a greater improvement in negative symptoms,although neither finding had been present at 6-week follow-up and neither wasstatistically significant. Amisulpride was associated with a greater side effect burden, including cardiac side effects. Economic analyses indicated thatamisulpride augmentation has the potential to be cost-effective in the short term[net saving of between £329 and £2011; no difference in quality-adjustedlife-years (QALYs)] and possibly in the longer term.LIMITATIONS: The trial under-recruited and, therefore, the power of statisticalanalysis to detect significant differences between the active and placebo groups was limited. The economic analyses indicated high uncertainty because of theshort duration and relatively small number of participants.CONCLUSIONS: The risk-benefit of amisulpride augmentation of clozapine forschizophrenia that has shown an insufficient response to a trial of clozapinemonotherapy is worthy of further investigation in larger studies. The size andextent of the side effect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapinecombination may partly reflect the comprehensive assessment of side effects inthis study. The design of future trials of such a treatment strategy should take into account that a clinical response may be not be evident within the 4- to6-week follow-up period usually considered adequate in studies of antipsychotictreatment of acute psychotic episodes. Economic evaluation indicated the need forlarger, longer-term studies to address uncertainty about the extent of savingsbecause of amisulpride and impact on QALYs. The extent and nature of the sideeffect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapine combination hasimplications for the nature and frequency of safety and tolerability monitoringof clozapine augmentation with a second antipsychotic in both clinical andresearch settings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number 2010-018963-40 and Current Controlled TrialsISRCTN68824876.FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full inHealth Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 49.

Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on the auditory mismatch negativity response and working memory performance in schizophrenia: a pilot study.,/pubmed/28864916,"Cognitive impairment has been proposed to be the core feature of schizophrenia(Sz). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form ofbrain stimulation which can improve cognitive function in healthy participantsand in psychiatric patients with cognitive deficits. tDCS has been shown toimprove cognition and hallucination symptoms in Sz, a disorder also associatedwith marked sensory processing deficits. Recent findings in healthy controlsdemonstrate that anodal tDCS increases auditory deviance detection, as measuredby the brain-based event-related potential, mismatch negativity (MMN), which is aputative biomarker of Sz that has been proposed as a target for treatment of Szcognition. This pilot study conducted a randomized, double-blind assessment ofthe effects of pre- and post-tDCS on MMN-indexed auditory discrimination in 12 Szpatients, moderated by auditory hallucination (AH) presence, as well as workingmemory performance. Assessments were conducted in three sessions involvingtemporal and frontal lobe anodal stimulation (to transiently excite local brainactivity), and one control session involving 'sham' stimulation (meaning with thedevice turned off, i.e., no stimulation). Results demonstrated a trend for pitch MMN amplitude to increase with anodal temporal tDCS, which was significant in asubgroup of Sz individuals with AHs. Anodal frontal tDCS significantly increased WM performance on the 2-back task, which was found to positively correlate withMMN-tDCS effects. The findings contribute to our understanding of tDCS effectsfor sensory processing deficits and working memory performance in Sz and may haveimplications for psychiatric disorders with sensory deficits.",Single arm,Y,,,Transcranial direct current stimulation,,,,schizophrenia,temporal and frontal lobe anodal stimulation,
Ethical acceptability of offering financial incentives for taking antipsychotic depot medication: patients' and clinicians' perspectives after a 12-month randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28851345,"BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial 'Money for Medication'(M4M) wasconducted in which patients were offered financial incentives for takingantipsychotic depot medication. This study assessed the attitudes and ethicalconsiderations of patients and clinicians who participated in this trial.METHODS: Three mental healthcare institutions in secondary psychiatric care inthe Netherlands participated in this study. Patients (n¾=¾169), 18-65¾years,diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or another psychoticdisorder who had been prescribed antipsychotic depot medication, were randomlyassigned to receive 12¾months of either treatment as usual plus a financialreward for each depot of medication received (intervention group) or treatment asusual alone (control group). Structured questionnaires were administered afterthe 12-month intervention period. Data were available for 133 patients (69control and 64 intervention) and for 97 clinicians.RESULTS: Patients (88%) and clinicians (81%) indicated that financial incentives were a good approach to improve medication adherence. Ethical concerns werecategorized according to the four-principles approach (autonomy, beneficence,non-maleficence, and justice). Patients and clinicians alike mentioned variousadvantages of M4M in clinical practice, such as increased medication adherenceand improved illness insight; but also disadvantages such as reduced intrinsicmotivation, loss of autonomy and feelings of dependence.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients evaluated financial incentives as an effectivemethod of improving medication adherence and were willing to accept this rewardduring clinical treatment. Clinicians were also positive about the use of thisintervention in daily practice. Ethical concerns are discussed in terms ofpatient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. We conclude that thisintervention is ethically acceptable under certain conditions, and that furtherresearch is necessary to clarify issues of benefit, motivation and the preferred size and duration of the incentive.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register, number NTR2350 .",RCT,,,,"treatment as usual plus a financialreward for each depot of medication received",treatment as usual,,,"schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or another psychotic disorder",medication adherence,

The differential effects of a focus on symptoms versus recovery in reducing stigma of schizophrenia.,/pubmed/28821903,"PURPOSE: We extend investigations of the impact of the content of video contactwith an individual with schizophrenia on stigma reduction. We examine whetherdifferential impacts persist over a 2-week period and the extent to which theyare mediated by perceived similarity and feelings of empathy and/or sympathy.METHOD: We used a randomized control trial wherein participants were exposed to avideo in which an individual described his recovery from schizophrenia, or thesame person described acute symptoms of schizophrenia, or a no-video controlcondition. Outcomes included impressions of and preferred social distance to the person in the video and people in general with schizophrenia and well asperceptions of similarity and feelings of sympathy and empathy. We also measured an overt behaviour, seating distance, at 2-week follow-up.RESULTS: The recovery-focused material was generally more effective in improving impressions and reducing preferred level of social distance. Although thesymptom-focused video resulted in great sympathy for the person, this did nottranslate into positive impressions or reduced social distance. Mediationalanalyses yielded findings consistent with the benefits of the recovery videobeing mediated by increased perceptions of similarity and lower feelings ofsympathy. Exposure to the recovery-focused video resulted in less anxiety inanticipation of meeting the person in the video relative to the controlcondition.CONCLUSIONS: Video contact emphasizing potential for recovery from schizophrenia was more effective in reducing stigmatizing responses than contact highlightingacute symptoms. Increased sympathy does not necessarily translate into reductionsin stigma.",RCT,,,,video in which an individual described his recovery from schizophrenia,same person described acute symptoms of schizophrenia,no-video control,,schizophrenia,impressions of and preferred social distance to the person in the video and people in general with schizophrenia,
Efficacy of lurasidone in the treatment of agitation: A post hoc analysis of five short-term studies in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.,/pubmed/28807142,"OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis evaluated the effect of lurasidone on agitationin acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.METHOD: Patient-level data were pooled from five 6-week, randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of fixed-dose, once-daily, orallurasidone (40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/d). Agitation was assessed with the Positiveand Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score, utilizing a mixedmodel for repeated measurement analysis.RESULTS: In patients with higher levels of agitation at baseline (PANSS-ECscore_14; n=773), lurasidone was associated with significantly greaterimprovement in least-squares (LS) mean PANSS-EC scores versus placebo at Day 3/4 (-1.6 vs -1.0; p<0.05), Day 7 (-2.3 vs -1.6; p<0.05), and at Week 6 endpoint(-5.5 vs -3.8; p<0.001; effect size=0.43). In patients with lower agitation atbaseline (PANSS-EC score<14; n=754), LS mean PANSS-EC score change wassignificantly greater for lurasidone compared with placebo at Day 7 (-0.8 vs-0.1; p<0. 01) through Week 6 endpoint (-1.9 vs -0.9; p<0.001; effect size=0.31).Higher doses of lurasidone were notably more effective than lower doses inpatients with more severe agitation at study baseline.CONCLUSION: In this pooled analysis of 5 short-term studies, lurasidone provided early and sustained reduction in agitation, assessed using the PANSS-EC score, inpatients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Higher doses of lurasidone were particularly effective in patients with more severe agitation at studybaseline. Overall, these results suggest that lurasidone may be a usefultreatment option for patients exhibiting agitation associated with acutepsychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.

Combination Antipsychotic Therapies: An Analysis From a Longitudinal Pragmatic Trial.,/pubmed/28806390,"BACKGROUND: Combination antipsychotics (CAs) are prescribed in schizophreniadespite limited evidence of efficacy. To explore the effect of switching from CA to monotherapy, we performed an exploratory analysis of the PROACTIVE (PreventingRelapse in Schizophrenia: Oral Antipsychotics Compared with Injectables:Evaluating Efficacy) study data, in which 305 patients with schizophrenia andschizoaffective disorder were followed for 30 months after randomization tolong-acting injectable (LAI) risperidone or second-generation oral antipsychotic (OA).METHODS: Patients who entered the PROACTIVE study on CA (n = 50), LAI (n = 20),or OA (n = 206) were compared in terms of time to relapse and clinical measures.FINDINGS: The OA group had significantly fewer hospitalizations than the CA group(P = 0.009) at baseline. In the CA group, 68% patients relapsed versus 53% in theLAI, and 52% in the OA groups. Although there was no significant difference inthe relapse rate among groups on _ test (_ = 3.85, P = 0.146), the log-rank test showed a significant difference among the groups in time to first relapse (_ =6.81, P = 0.033), with significantly longer time to relapse in the OA group(mean, 562.8 days) than in the CA group (mean, 409.5; P = 0.011).

A Naturalistic Comparison of Methylphenidate and Risperidone Monotherapy in Drug-Naive Youth With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Comorbid With Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Aggression.,/pubmed/28806385,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) andoppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are frequently co-occurring in youth, butdata about the pharmacological management of this comorbidity are scarce,especially when impulsive aggression is prominent. Although stimulants are thefirst-line medication for ADHD, second-generation antipsychotics, namely,risperidone, are frequently used. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of monotherapy with the stimulant methylphenidate (MPH) and risperidone in aconsecutive sample of 40 drug-naive male youths diagnosed as having ADHD-combinedpresentation, comorbid with ODD and aggression, without psychiatriccomorbidities, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, Fifth Edition criteria and a structured clinical interview (Schedulefor Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present andLifetime Version).METHODS: Twenty males treated with MPH (mean age, 8.95 ± 1.67 years) and 20 malestreated with risperidone (mean age, 9.35 ± 2.72 years), followed up to 6 months, were assessed according to efficacy measures (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL],Clinical Global Impression-Severity [CGI-S] and Improvement [CGI-I], ChildrenGlobal Assessment Scale), and safety measures. At the end of the follow-up, both medications were similarly effective based on CBCL subscales of aggression andrule-breaking behaviors, on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders-oriented oppositional defiant problems and conduct problems, and onCGI-S, CGI-I, and Children Global Assessment Scale, but only MPH was effective onCBCL attention problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems. Risperidonewas associated with weight gain and elevated prolactin levels.IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Although the nonrandomized, nonblind design limits the conclusions of our exploratory study, our findings suggest that when ADHD iscomorbid with ODD and aggression MPH and risperidone are both effective onaggressive behavior, but only stimulants are effective on ADHD symptoms.",RCT,,,,stimulant methylphenidate,risperidone,,,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Child Behavior Checklist,

A Pilot Study of the Usefulness of a Single Olanzapine Plasma Concentration as an Indicator of Early Drug Effect in a Small Sample of First-Episode Psychosis Patients.,/pubmed/28796022,"PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Studies analyzing concentration-effect relationships insecond-generation antipsychotics have reported contradictory results in chronicschizophrenia. No data are available for the early stages of the disease. Thepresent study aims to evaluate the association between a single olanzapine plasmaconcentration, clinical response, and severity of adverse effects infirst-episode psychosis (FEP); to test the utility of various plasma breakpoints as markers of early response to treatment; and to identify variables affectingolanzapine concentrations.METHODS: Data from 23 compliant FEP patients receiving olanzapine monotherapy(5-30 mg/d) were evaluated 2 months after beginning treatment. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and theMontgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale. Adverse effects were rated using theUdvalg for Kliniske UndersËgelser scale. Plasma samples were drawn at 11 (SD, 1) hours after dosing and analyzed with high-performance liquidchromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.FINDINGS: Consistent with findings on chronic disease, dose, age, sex, weight,and cigarettes/day accounted for some of the variability in olanzapineconcentrations. While no relationship was found between olanzapine concentrationsand adverse effects or improvement of depressive symptoms, response of psychotic symptoms was associated with concentrations between 22.56 and 77.92 ng/mL. Plasmabreakpoints did not show sufficiently high specificity, resulting in a largenumber of false-positive results.IMPLICATIONS: Although olanzapine concentrations do not seem to be reliableindicators of early drug effect in FEP, they may still prove useful for detectingnoncompliance, as well as pharmacokinetically relevant comorbidities or geneticparticularities in drug metabolism.",Single arm,Y,,,olanzapine,,,,chronic schizophrenia,Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,
Attentional avoidance increases voice hearing in an analogue task in people with psychosis: An experimental study.,/pubmed/28763737,"Cognitive models of psychosis suggest that unhelpful ways of responding toexperiences can maintain such experiences and the associated distress. Theresponse styles of attentional avoidance and attentional focusing weremanipulated in an analogue voice-hearing task. Predictions were that both wouldincrease detection of words in response to an ambiguous audio-recording but that attentional avoidance would lead to a greater increase than focusing. We alsopredicted that there would be a greater increase in anxiety and distress in theavoidance group. Predictions were tested in a sample of 44 participants with adiagnosis of schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned to eitherattentional avoidance or focusing while listening to an ambiguous auditory task. Number of words identified and anxiety and distress were recorded. As predicted, there was an increase in the number of words identified in both groups; however, this increase was greater in the avoidance group. The prediction that there wouldalso be an increase in distress that would be greater in the avoidance group was not supported. It is possible that emotional reactions relate more closely toappraisals of the voice. The results suggest that avoidance of experiences isparticularly counterproductive and can result in greater detection ofexperiences.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Efficacy and Safety of MIN-101: A 12-Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of a New Drug in Development for the Treatment of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia.",/pubmed/28750582,"OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability ofMIN-101, a compound with affinities for sigma-2 and 5-HT2A receptors and nodirect dopamine affinities, in comparison with placebo in treating negativesymptoms in stabilized patients with schizophrenia.METHOD: The trial enrolled 244 patients who had been symptomatically stable forat least 3 months and had scores of at least 20 on the negative subscale of thePositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). After at least 5 days' withdrawalfrom all antipsychotic medication, patients were randomly assigned to receiveplacebo or 32 mg/day or 64 mg/day of MIN-101 for 12 weeks. The primary outcomemeasure was the PANSS negative factor score (pentagonal structure model).Secondary outcome measures were PANSS total score and scores on the ClinicalGlobal Impressions Scale (CGI), the Brief Negative Symptom Scale, the BriefAssessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, and the Calgary Depression Scale forSchizophrenia.RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in PANSS negative factor scorewas observed, with lower scores for the MIN-101 32 mg/day and 64 mg/day groupscompared with the placebo group (effect sizes, d=0.45 and d=0.57, respectively). Supporting these findings were similar effects on several of the secondaryoutcome measures, such as the PANSS negative symptom, total, and activationfactor scores, the CGI severity item, and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale. Therewere no statistically significant differences in PANSS positive scale scorebetween the MIN-101 and placebo groups.

Effects of chair yoga therapy on physical fitness in patients with psychiatric disorders: A 12-week single-blind randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28750232,"INTRODUCTION: Since falls may lead to fractures and have serious, potentiallyfatal outcomes, prevention of falls is an urgent public health issue. We examinedthe effects of chair yoga therapy on physical fitness among psychiatric patients in order to reduce the risk of falls, which has not been previously reported inthe literature.METHODS: In this 12-week single-blind randomized controlled trial with a 6-weekfollow-up, inpatients with mixed psychiatric diagnoses were randomly assigned to either chair yoga therapy in addition to ongoing treatment, ortreatment-as-usual. Chair yoga therapy was conducted as twice-weekly 20-minsessions over 12 weeks.

"Effectiveness, Adverse Effects and Drug Compliance of Long-Acting Injectable Risperidone in Children and Adolescents.",/pubmed/28726075,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although the use of oral risperidone in children andadolescents has been well studied, there is little information on theintramuscular use of long-acting injectable risperidone (LAIR). The aims of this study were to investigate the effectiveness and adverse effects of LAIR inchildren and adolescents with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, andschizophrenia.METHODS: In total, 42 patients (age range 12-17 years) who were non-adherent tooral antipsychotic drugs, received 25 mg of LAIR intramuscularly every 2 weeks.The drug was administered at least four times and up to 66 times (median druguse: 9.50 times). The effectiveness and adverse effects of the treatment wereexamined.RESULTS: There was an improvement in 13 (92.8%) of the 14 patients diagnosed withbipolar disorder, in 25 (78.1%) of 32 patients diagnosed with conduct disorderand in one (50%) of two patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Six patients hadcomorbid conduct disorder and bipolar disorder. Totally, 81% of the patientsimproved with LAIR. Weight-gain, daytime somnolence, muscle stiffness and spasms,impaired concentration, and fatigue were the most common side effects through thewhole sample. Menstrual problems were common in girls. In the study, 57.1% of thepatients continued to receive their injections regularly until the end of thetreatment, under physician control. A total of 16.7% discontinued the treatmentdue to non-adherence. The LAIR treatment was terminated in 26.2% of the patients,due to weight-gain, dystonia, and galactorrhea.CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia who show noncompliance with oral drugs, LAIR may improvetreatment compliance. LAIR is a reliable treatment in terms of its effectiveness.Weight-gain, dystonia, and galactorrhea were the adverse effects that wereresponsible for LAIR treatment cessation.",Single arm,Y,,,risperidone,,,,"conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, andschizophrenia",effectiveness and adverse effects,
Combining two model systems of psychosis: The effects of schizotypy and sleep deprivation on oculomotor control and psychotomimetic states.,/pubmed/28714081,"Model systems of psychosis, such as schizotypy or sleep deprivation, are valuablein informing our understanding of the etiology of the disorder and aiding thedevelopment of new treatments. Schizophrenia patients, high schizotypes, andsleep-deprived subjects are known to share deficits in oculomotor biomarkers.Here, we aimed to further validate the schizotypy and sleep deprivation modelsand investigated, for the first time, their interactive effects on smooth pursuiteye movements (SPEM), prosaccades, antisaccades, predictive saccades, andmeasures of psychotomimetic states, anxiety, depression, and stress. To do so,n_=_19 controls and n_=_17 high positive schizotypes were examined after both anormal sleep night and 24 h of sleep deprivation. Schizotypes displayed higherSPEM global position error, catch-up saccade amplitude, and increasedpsychotomimetic states. Sleep deprivation impaired SPEM, prosaccade, antisaccade,and predictive saccade performance and increased levels of psychotomimeticexperiences. Additionally, sleep deprivation reduced SPEM gain in schizotypes butnot controls. We conclude that oculomotor impairments are observed in relation toschizotypy and following sleep deprivation, supporting their utility asbiomarkers in model systems of psychosis. The combination of these models withoculomotor biomarkers may be particularly fruitful in assisting the developmentof new antipsychotic or pro-cognitive drugs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association of schizophrenia onset age and white matter integrity with treatment effect of D-cycloserine: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study.,/pubmed/28701225,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that drugs which promote theN-Methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor function by stimulating the glycine modulatory site in the receptor improve negative symptoms and cognitivedysfunction in schizophrenia patients being treated with antipsychotic drugs.METHODS: We performed a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study involving41 schizophrenia patients in which D-cycloserine 50¾mg/day was added-on, and the influence of the onset age and association with white matter integrity on MRdiffusion tensor imaging were investigated for the first time. The patients were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scale for theAssessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Brief Assessment of Cognition inSchizophrenia (BACS), and other scales.RESULTS: D-cycloserine did not improve positive or negative symptoms or cognitivedysfunction in schizophrenia. The investigation in consideration of the onset agesuggests that D-cycloserine may aggravate negative symptoms of early-onsetschizophrenia. The better treatment effect of D-cycloserine on BACS was observed when the white matter integrity of the sagittal stratum/ cingulum/fornix striaterminalis/genu of corpus callosum/external capsule was higher, and the bettertreatment effect on PANSS general psychopathology (PANSS-G) was observed when thewhite matter integrity of the splenium of corpus callosum was higher. Incontrast, the better treatment effect of D-cycloserine on PANSS-G and SANS-IVwere observed when the white matter integrity of the posterior thalamic radiation(left) was lower.CONCLUSION: It was suggested that response to D-cycloserine is influenced by the onset age and white matter integrity.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (number UMIN000000468 ).Registered 18 August 2006.",RCT,,,,D-cycloserine,placebo,,,schizophrenia,Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,

Informationally administered reward enhances intrinsic motivation in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/28662466,"Even when individuals with schizophrenia have an intact ability to enjoyrewarding moments, the means to assist them to translate rewarding experiencesinto goal-directed behaviors is unclear. The present study sought to determinewhether informationally administered rewards enhance intrinsic motivation tofoster goal-directed behaviors in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthycontrols (HCs). Eighty-four participants (SZ=43, HCs=41) were randomly assignedto conditions involving either a performance-contingent reward with aninformationally administered reward or a task-contingent reward with no feedback.Participants were asked to play two cognitive games of equalized difficulty.Accuracy, self-reported intrinsic motivation, free-choice intrinsic motivation(i.e., game play during a free-choice observation period), and perceivedcompetency were measured. Intrinsic motivation and perceived competency in thecognitive games were similar between the two participant groups. Theinformationally administered reward significantly enhanced self-reportedintrinsic motivation and perceived competency in both the groups. The likelihood that individuals with schizophrenia would play the game during the free-choiceobservation period was four times greater in the informationally administeredreward condition than that in the no-feedback condition.

In addition to the Medication Adherence RatingScale (MARS), sociodemographic information, history of homelessness, illnessseverity using the Modified Colorado Symptom Index (MCSI) and the MultnomahCommunity Integration Scale (MCAS), and drug information were collected.RESULTS: In total, 218 HSZ patients (16.1% women, mean age 36.8¾±¾9.3¾years) wereincluded in this study. In the multivariate analysis, being a woman and havinghigher illness severity (MCSI score) and lower ""acceptance of illness"" (MCASscore) were significantly associated with lower MARS index scores. Compared tomen, women had lower MARS dimension 1 ('medication adherence behavior') anddimension 3 ('negative side effects and attitudes toward psychotropicmedication') scores. First-generation antipsychotic use was also associated with lower MARS dimension 3 scores.CONCLUSION: HSZ women reported lower adherence than men, mainly due to havingmore subjective negative side effects and worse attitudes toward psychotropicmedication. Future longitudinal studies should confirm these findings and explorethe applicability of specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatmentstrategies for HSZ women, including treatment dose adaptation andpsychoeducation.

We studied 20multi-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy controls who performedaerobic exercise (endurance training) combined with cognitive remediation for 3months and 21 multi-episode schizophrenia patients allocated to a controlintervention (table soccer) combined with cognitive remediation. Magneticresonance imaging-based assessments were performed at baseline and after 3 monthswith FreeSurfer. No effects of PRSs were found on total hippocampal volumechange. Subfield analyses showed that the volume changes between baseline and 3months in the left CA4/DG were significantly influenced by PRSs in schizophrenia patients performing aerobic exercise. A larger genetic risk burden was associatedwith a less pronounced volume increase or a decrease in volume over the course ofthe exercise intervention. Results of exploratory enrichment analyses reinforced the notion of genetic risk factors modulating biological processes tightlyrelated to synaptic ion channel activity, calcium signaling, glutamate signaling and regulation of cell morphogenesis. We hypothesize that a high polygenic riskmay negatively influence neuroplasticity in CA4/DG during aerobic exercise inschizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Oxidative stress reduction related to the efficacy of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in first episode schizophrenia: Secondary outcome analysis of the OFFER randomized trial.,/pubmed/28651701,"Intervention studies of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) as add-ontherapy in patients with schizophrenia have not examined changes in oxidativestress. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of a 26-week intervention composed of 2.2g/day of n-3 PUFA was found to reduce symptom severity in first-episodeschizophrenia patients. The present study is an extension of our previous report,whose secondary aim was to assess the association between the clinical effect of n-3 PUFA and changes in oxidative stress indices. Seventy-one patients aged 16-35were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the study arms. Total plasma antioxidant capacity and 8-epi-isoprostane F2_ content were assessed at baseline and at weeks 8 and 26 of the study as secondary outcome measures. Significantchanges in oxidative stress indices favouring the intervention group wereobserved: decreases in 8-isoprostane F2_ (p<0.001) and increases in total plasma antioxidant capacity (p<0.001). Significant correlations between changes inclinical scores relevant to symptom severity and changes in oxidative indiceswere observed. The results of the present study hence suggest that the efficacyof a six-month intervention with n-3 PUFA observed in first-episode schizophreniamay be related to improvement in oxidative stress indices.",Single arm,Y,,,n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ,,,,schizophrenia,Total plasma antioxidant capacity and 8-epi-isoprostane F2_ content,
Clozapine Use in a Cohort of First-Episode Psychosis.,/pubmed/28650930,"PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: For approximately one third of individuals treated forpsychosis or schizophrenia, antipsychotic medications will have little or notherapeutic benefit. Clozapine remains the sole medication approved fortreatment-resistant schizophrenia, and studies have demonstrated its superiorefficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms.METHODS/PROCEDURES: Data were collected from the medical records of people whooriginally presented with a first-episode psychosis between 1995 and 1999 (N =171). Data were obtained from first presentation up to December 31, 2013 or untilthe patient was discharged or transferred. Information on service use andphysical health was gathered using a data collection template designedspecifically for this audit.FINDINGS/RESULTS: Twenty-eight (16.3%) of the cohort were prescribed clozapine.Data were available for 24 individuals. Of this clozapine subsample, the mean ageat baseline was 23.11 (SD = 4.58); 82.14% (n = 23) were male; and 82.14% (n = 23)had a baseline diagnosis of schizophrenia. The mean time to first trial ofclozapine was 6.7 years. The mean number of antipsychotics prescribed beforeclozapine trial was 4.85. After the initiation of clozapine, the mean number ofhospital admissions reduced from 6.04 per year to 0.88 per year.IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 in 5 of the original cohort was considered to have a suboptimal response to trials of antipsychotic medication. The use ofclozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia is underutilized, and betterunderstanding of the barriers to prescribing clozapine is necessary given theimplications for patient's quality of life and hospital admission rates. Physicalhealth data further emphasizes the importance of physical health monitoring inthis vulnerable population.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Does Half-Life Matter After Antipsychotic Discontinuation? A Relapse Comparison in Schizophrenia With 3 Different Formulations of Paliperidone.,/pubmed/28640988,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 1 oral and 2 distinct long-acting injectable(LAI) formulations of the same antipsychotic on times to relapse followingmedication discontinuation.METHODS: Data were drawn from 3 similarly designed, multicenter, double-blind,placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal studies of paliperidone in adults with a schizophrenia diagnosis (according to DSM-IV criteria for _ 1 year beforescreening): once-daily extended-release oral paliperidone (ORAL paliperidone),once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP1M), and once-every-3-months paliperidone palmitate (PP3M). In a post hoc analysis, we compared median time to relapseacross the treatment-withdrawal arms of the 3 studies using final analysisdatasets. Time to relapse in the withdrawal arm of each study was examined using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Four hundred forty-nine patients were withdrawn from 3 paliperidoneformulations: 101 from ORAL paliperidone, 203 from PP1M, and 145 from PP3M.Postwithdrawal median (95% confidence interval [CI]) days to relapse were 58 days(42-114 days) for ORAL paliperidone, 172 days (134-222 days) for PP1M, and 395days (274 days-not reached) for PP3M (P < .0001, pairwise comparisons). Relapserisk was significantly lower (P < .001) for patients who withdrew from either PP formulation relative to ORAL paliperidone and additionally for patients whowithdrew from PP3M relative to PP1M.CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that 50% of patients who withdrew treatment fromORAL paliperidone, PP1M, or PP3M remained relapse free for approximately 2months, 6 months, and 13 months, respectively. This may be relevant for riskmitigation strategies in schizophrenia, a condition in which interruptions inmaintenance antipsychotic treatment are commonplace and unpredictable.

Effect of Liraglutide Treatment on Prediabetes and Overweight or Obesity in Clozapine- or Olanzapine-Treated Patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/28601891,"Importance: Compared with the general population, patients with schizophreniahave a 2- to 3-fold higher mortality rate primarily caused by cardiovasculardisease. Previous interventions designed to counteract antipsychotic-inducedweight gain and cardiometabolic disturbances reported limited effects.Objectives: To determine the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptoragonist liraglutide added to clozapine or olanzapine treatment of schizophreniaspectrum disorders.Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical double-blind trialenrolled participants at 2 clinical sites in Denmark. Of 214 eligibleparticipants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 103 were randomized toliraglutide or placebo. Participants received stable treatment with clozapine or olanzapine, were overweight or obese, and had prediabetes. Data were collectedfrom May 1, 2013, through February 25, 2016.Interventions: Treatment for 16 weeks with once-daily subcutaneous injection ofliraglutide or placebo. Trial drug therapy was titrated during the first 2 weeks of the study.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in glucose toleranceestimated by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test result. Secondary end pointsincluded change in body weight and cardiometabolic parameters.Results: Of the 103 patients undergoing randomization (60 men [58.3%] and 43women [41.7%]), 97 were included in the efficacy analysis, with a mean (SD) ageof 42.5 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight inkilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 33.8 (5.9). The liraglutide andplacebo groups had comparable characteristics (mean [SD] age, 42.1 [10.7] vs 43.0[10.5] years; 30 men in each group; mean [SD] body mass index, 33.7 [5.1] vs 33.9[6.6]).

Pharmacokinetic Profile of a 2-Month Dose Regimen of Aripiprazole Lauroxil: A Phase I Study and a Population Pharmacokinetic Model.,/pubmed/28597226,"BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) is a long-acting injectable medicationapproved for the treatment of schizophrenia. Current AL regimens are 441¾mg,662¾mg, and 882¾mg administered monthly (every 4¾weeks [q4wk]), or 882¾mgadministered every 6¾weeks (q6wk).OBJECTIVE: We examined the feasibility of a 2-month (every 8¾weeks [q8wk]) dosinginterval of AL in a phase I open-label pharmacokinetic study investigating AL1064¾mg administered q8wk for 24¾weeks, followed by 20¾weeks of safety andpharmacokinetic measurements (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02320032). Second, apopulation pharmacokinetic model (referred to as the 2MPopPK model) was generatedusing data collected from the present trial, as well as data obtained fromearlier studies.METHODS: The phase I study included patients with schizophrenia orschizoaffective disorder maintained on an oral antipsychotic (n¾=¾140) who wereassigned to one of three groups: AL 441¾mg q4wk, AL 882¾mg q6wk, or AL 1064¾mgq8wk, with a total of seven, five, or four injections administered, respectively.No oral aripiprazole lead-in supplementation was administered and patientscontinued on maintenance oral antipsychotics. Pharmacokinetic samples werecollected at various time points during the 24-week study period and the 20-week follow-up period. Plasma concentrations obtained from the phase I study wereanalyzed using non-compartmental methods. Additionally, the data were combinedwith data collected from prior studies to develop the 2MPopPK model.RESULTS: Following the final injection of AL in the phase I study, maximumaripiprazole concentrations were achieved 24.4-35.2¾days after the last dose and persisted for the duration of the study. The mean C avg,ss values were125.8¾ng/ml, 131.1¾ng/ml, and 140.7¾ng/ml for the 441¾mg q4wk, 882¾mg q6wk, and1064¾mg q8wk doses, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of aripiprazole following the last dose was 53.9¾days for the 1064¾mg dose, 55.1¾days for the882¾mg dose, and 57.2¾days for the 441¾mg dose. The 2MPopPK dataset included14,524 aripiprazole concentrations from 700 patients with schizophrenia. Theduration of absorption of aripiprazole was estimated as 43¾days (95% confidenceinterval [CI] 42-45¾days), which was preceded by a 3.2-day lag time (95% CI3.0-3.5¾days) for a total duration of input into the systemic circulation of46¾days following intramuscular administration of AL. Multiple-dose simulationsshowed that the 1064¾mg q8wk regimen provides aripiprazole concentrations within the concentration range associated with 441¾mg and 882¾mg q4wk doses previouslydemonstrated to be efficacious in a phase III study.CONCLUSION: These data from the phase I study and the 2MPopPK model support thesuitability of using the AL 1064¾mg dose as a 2-month (q8wk) dose interval optionfor the treatment of schizophrenia.",RCT,,,,Aripiprazole lauroxil every 4 weeks,Aripiprazole lauroxil every 6 weeks,Aripiprazole lauroxil every 8 weeks,,schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,safety and pharmacokinetic measurements ,
Predictors of treatment response and drop out in the Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS) study.,/pubmed/28595147,"The Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS) comparedthe efficacy of risperidone, olanzapine, and molindone over 8 weeks in 119 youthsage 8-19 years with early-onset schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Fromthis large dataset, we examined predictors of treatment response and drop outusing stepwise regression and receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC)analysis. Treatment response was defined as having both a _ 20% improvement inPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score and a Clinical GlobalImpression-Improvement (CGI-I) score < 3. More severe baseline symptoms, having ahistory of being in an early education program, and previous prescription of amood stabilizer increased the likelihood of responding to treatment. Anhedoniaand poor community functioning predicted a reduction in symptom severity on thePANSS. Random assignment to different antipsychotic treatment was not predictive of outcome. Parental report of aggressive behaviors at baseline and being AfricanAmerican were associated with a greater likelihood of drop out. Our resultssuggest youth with more severe psychotic symptoms are most likely to benefit fromtreatment with antipsychotics and that aggressive youth may require additionalsupport to improve treatment adherence.

"With a little help from my friends"" social predictors of clinical recovery in first-episode psychosis.",/pubmed/28578180,"Social functioning is a conglomerate of factors central to clinical recoveryafter a first-episode psychosis. There is a lack of studies investigating therelative impact of factors related to social interaction. Disentangling thesecould facilitate improvement of psychosocial interventions. This study aims toinvestigate the impact of social interactions on two-year clinical recovery infirst-episode psychosis, by examining frequency and satisfaction of relationshipswith family and friends. A baseline sample of 178 first-episode psychosisindividuals were followed up over two years regarding social functioning andclinical status. We longitudinally compared those who were to those who were not recovered using generalized estimating equations analyses. Our results showedthat frequency of social interactions with friends was a significant positivepredictor of clinical recovery over a two-year period. Perceived satisfactionwith relationships, and frequency of family interaction did not show significant effects. We conclude that interaction with friends is a malleable factor thatcould be targeted for early intervention. This would facilitate protectivefactors through the preservation of existing social networks and thus reduce the risk of disability associated with long-term psychosis. Findings indicate thateven individuals with an inclination towards social withdrawal and isolationcould benefit from this type of intervention.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,

Incidence and risk factors of acute akathisia in 493 individuals with first episode non-affective psychosis: a 6-week randomised study of antipsychotic treatment.,/pubmed/28567698,"INTRODUCTION: Acute akathisia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome with a negativeeffect on illness outcome. Its incidence in patients treated with antipsychotics has shown to be highly variable across studies.OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to investigate prevalence, risk factors for thedevelopment of acute akathisia, and differences in incidence betweenantipsychotics in a sample of 493 first episode non-affective psychosis patients.METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of three prospective, randomized,flexible-dose, and open-label clinical trials. Patients were randomized assigned to different arms of treatment (haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone,risperidone, or aripiprazole). Akathisia was determined using the BarnesAkathisia Scale at 6¾weeks after antipsychotic initialization. Univariateanalyses were performed to identify demographic, biochemical, substance use,clinical, and treatment-related predictors of acute akathisia. Considering these results, a predictive model based of a subsample of 132 patients was constructed with akathisia as the dependent variable.RESULTS: The overall incidence of akathisia was 19.5%. No differences indemographic, biochemical, substance use, and clinical variables were found.Significant incidence differences between antipsychotics were observed (_2¾=¾68.21, p¾=¾0.000): haloperidol (57%), risperidone (20%), aripiprazole(18.2%), ziprasidone (17.2%), olanzapine (3.6%), and quetiapine (3.5%).

Effects of aripiprazole versus risperidone on brain activation during planning and social-emotional evaluation in schizophrenia: A single-blind randomized exploratory study.,/pubmed/28558941,"Impaired function of prefrontal brain networks may be the source of both negativesymptoms and neurocognitive problems in psychotic disorders. Whereas mostantipsychotics may decrease prefrontal activation, the partial dopamineD2-receptor agonist aripiprazole is hypothesized to improve prefrontal function. This study investigated whether patients with a psychotic disorder would showstronger activation of prefrontal areas and associated regions after treatmentwith aripiprazole compared to risperidone treatment. In this exploratorypharmacological neuroimaging study, 24 patients were randomly assigned to either aripiprazole or risperidone. At baseline and after nine weeks treatment theyunderwent an interview and MRI session. Here we report on brain activation(measured with arterial spin labeling) during performance of two tasks, the Towerof London and the Wall of Faces. Aripiprazole treatment decreased activation ofthe middle frontal, superior frontal and occipital gyrus (ToL) and medialtemporal and inferior frontal gyrus, putamen and cuneus (WoF), while activationincreased after risperidone. Activation increased in the ventral anteriorcingulate and posterior insula (ToL), and superior frontal, superior temporal andprecentral gyrus (WoF) after aripiprazole treatment and decreased afterrisperidone. Both treatment groups had increased ventral insula activation (ToL) and middle temporal gyrus (WoF), and decreased occipital cortex, precuneus andcaudate head activation (ToL) activation.

Glutamatergic deficit and schizophrenia-like negative symptoms: new evidence from ketamine-induced mismatch negativity alterations in healthy male humans.,/pubmed/28556775,"BACKGROUND: Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a majortranslational approach for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ketamine comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitiveand negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatchnegativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients withschizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, itwas the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudesduring ketamine administration are associated with the emergence ofschizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers.METHODS: We examined the impact of ketamine during an MMN paradigm with64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed the psychopathologicalstatus using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in healthy malevolunteers using a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design.Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for source localization.RESULTS: Twenty-four men were included in our analysis. Significant reductions ofMMN amplitudes and an increase in all PANSS scores were identified under theketamine condition. Smaller MMN amplitudes were specifically associated with morepronounced negative symptoms. Source analysis of MMN generators indicated asignificantly reduced current source density (CSD) under the ketamine conditionin the primary auditory cortex, the posterior cingulate and the middle frontalgyrus.LIMITATIONS: The sample included only men within a tight age range of 20-32years.CONCLUSION: The MMN might represent a biomarker for negative symptoms inschizophrenia related to an insufficient NMDAR system and could be used toidentify patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms due to NMDARdysfunction.",RCT,,,,ketamine,placebo,,,healthy volunteers,Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,

The effect of a mindfulness-based intervention in cognitive functions and psychological well-being applied as an early intervention in schizophrenia and high-risk mental state in a Chilean sample: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28545578,"BACKGROUND: According to the projections of the World Health Organization, 15% ofall disabilities will be associated with mental illnesses by 2020. One of themental disorders with the largest social impacts due to high personal and family costs is psychosis. Among the most effective psychological approaches to treatschizophrenia and other psychotic disorders at the world level is cognitivebehavioral therapy. Recently, cognitive behavioral therapy has introduced severaltools and strategies that promote psychological processes based on acceptance andmindfulness. A large number of studies support the effectiveness of mindfulnessin dealing with various mental health problems, including psychosis. This studyis aimed at determining the efficiency of a mindfulness-based program inincreasing cognitive function and psychological well-being in patients with afirst episode of schizophrenia and a high risk mental state (those at risk ofdeveloping an episode of psychosis).METHODS AND DESIGN: This is an experimentally designed, multi-center randomizedcontrolled trial, with a 3-month follow-up period. The study participants will be48 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (first episode) and 48 with a high-risk mental state, from Santiago, Chile, aged between 15 and 35¾years. Participantswill be submitted to a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), which will involvetaking part in eight mindfulness workshops adapted for people with psychosis.Workshops will last approximately 1.5¾hours and take place once a week, over8¾weeks. The primary outcome will be the cognitive function through Measurementand Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) and thesecondary outcome will be psychological well-being measured by self-reportingquestionnaires.DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this trial will add empirical evidence to thebenefits and feasibility of MBIs for the psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with schizophrenia and high-risk mental states in reducing cognitive impairmentin attention, working memory, and social cognition, as well as increasing thepsychological well-being by empowering the patients' personal resources in themanagement of their own symptoms and psychotic experiences.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registration number ISRCTN24327446 .

Raloxifene Plus Antipsychotics Versus Placebo Plus Antipsychotics in Severely Ill Decompensated Postmenopausal Women With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,/pubmed/28541645,"OBJECTIVE: Several single-center studies have found raloxifene, an estrogenagonist, to be effective in ameliorating symptoms of schizophrenia in stablepatients as augmentation of antipsychotics. This multicenter study assessedwhether raloxifene plus antipsychotic treatment, in comparison to placebo plusantipsychotics, improves symptoms or cognition in severely ill decompensatedschizophrenia patients.METHODS: In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 200severely ill, decompensated postmenopausal women who met DSM-IV-TR criteria forschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited from January 2011 toDecember 2012 and were randomized to receive either raloxifene 120 mg/d plusantipsychotics or placebo plus antipsychotics. The primary outcome measure wasPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of the trial.RESULTS: The placebo plus antipsychotics group experienced statisticallysignificant improvement in PANSS total score (P < .001) compared to theraloxifene plus antipsychotics group, using mixed models for repeated measures,with results favoring placebo by 4.5 points (95% CI, 2.3-6.7). These results wereclearly outside the 95% confidence interval. This negative effect was morepronounced in patients who had more frequent relapses and in those with baseline PANSS scores of 100 or higher. There were no differences between groups inClinical Global Impression Scale-Severity scores or Composite Brief Assessment ofCognition in Schizophrenia scores at 16 weeks (P > .3). Baselinefollicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels did not alter the drug-placebo differences.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in the active treatment arm showed worse outcome thanthose in the placebo arm, most likely as a result of chance variation, but theresults unequivocally show no benefit of antipsychotics plus raloxifene versusantipsychotics plus placebo in this large randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled trial in postmenopausal women.

Randomized controlled trial of an internet cognitive behavioral skills-based program for auditory hallucinations in persons with psychosis.,/pubmed/28517948,"OBJECTIVE: Despite strong evidence supporting the effectiveness ofcognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp), most clinicians in the United States have received little or no training in the approach and access remainsvery low, indicating a potential role for technology in increasing access to thisintervention. Coping With Voices (CWV) is a 10-session, interactive, Web-basedCBTp skills program that was developed to meet this need, and was shown to befeasible and associated with reduced severity of auditory hallucinations in aprevious pilot study. To more rigorously evaluate this program, a randomizedcontrolled trial was conducted comparing the efficacy of CWV to usual care (UC).METHOD: The trial was conducted with a sample of 37 community mental healthcenter clients with schizophrenia and moderate-to-severe auditory hallucinations,with assessments conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up.RESULTS: Engagement in and satisfaction with the CWV program were high. Both the CWV and UC groups improved comparably in severity of auditory hallucinations and other symptoms over the treatment and at follow-up. However, participants in the CWV program showed significantly greater increases in social functioning and inknowledge about CBTp.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results suggest that the CWVprogram has promise for increasing access to CBTp, and associated benefits in themanagement of distressing psychotic symptoms and improving social functioning.(PsycINFO Database Record",RCT,,,,Coping With Voices,usual care,,,schizophrenia and moderate-to-severe auditory hallucinations,Engagement in and satisfaction,
"Add-on Antidepressants in the Naturalistic Treatment of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder - When, Who, and How?",/pubmed/28505669,"The aim of this study was to evaluate antidepressant add-on treatment within the acute treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients. Antidepressantadd-on was evaluated in 365 patients within a naturalistic multicenter study.Patients with/without antidepressant add-on were compared regarding clinical and treatment-related variables, response and remission, and remission of depressive and negative symptoms. The efficacy of antidepressant add-on treatment wasfurthermore analyzed applying marginal structure models. Twenty-three percent of the patients received antidepressant add-on for a mean duration of 50.28 (33.42) days. Patients with the diagnosis of a schizoaffective disorder, multiple illnessepisodes, and a longer duration of their illness as well as those withsignificantly fewer baseline positive symptoms, more negative and depressivesymptoms, more side effects, and less subjective well-being were augmented withantidepressants. At discharge no significant effect of antidepressant add-ontreatment was observed in terms of a 25% improvement (p=0.2623), a 50%improvement (p=0.3946), remission (p=0.0552), or remission of depressive(p=0.6336) and negative symptoms (p=0.8756).

A 60-Week Prospective RCT of a Self-Management Intervention for Individuals With Serious Mental Illness and Diabetes Mellitus.,/pubmed/28502243,"OBJECTIVES: A 60-week randomized controlled trial assessed the effects oftargeted training in illness management (TTIM) versus treatment as usual among200 individuals with serious mental illness and diabetes mellitus.METHODS: The study used the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), theMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Brief PsychiatricRating Scale (BPRS) to assess psychiatric symptoms; the Global Assessment ofFunctioning (GAF) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) to assess functioning;the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to assess general health, and serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to assess diabetes control.RESULTS: Participants' mean±SD age was 52.7±9.5 years, and 54% were AfricanAmerican. They were diagnosed as having depression (48%), schizophrenia (25%),and bipolar disorder (28%). At baseline, depression severity was substantial but psychosis severity was modest. At 60 weeks, there was greater improvement amongTTIM participants versus treatment-as-usual recipients on the CGI (p<.001), theMADRS (p=.016), and the GAF (p=.003). Diabetes knowledge was significantlyimproved among TTIM participants but not in the treatment-as-usual group. In posthoc analyses among participants whose HbA1c levels at baseline metrecommendations set by the American Diabetes Association for persons with highcomorbidity (53%), TTIM participants had minimal change in HbA1c over the 60-weekfollow-up, whereas HbA1c levels worsened in the treatment-as-usual group.CONCLUSIONS: TTIM was associated with improved psychiatric symptoms, functioning,and diabetes knowledge compared with treatment as usual.

Modafinil and cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia and healthy volunteers: the effects of test battery in a randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/28464963,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have major functional impacts.Modafinil is a cognitive enhancer whose effect in healthy volunteers iswell-described, but whose effects on the cognitive deficits of schizophreniaappear to be inconsistent. Two possible reasons for this are that cognitive test batteries vary in their sensitivity, or that the phase of illness may beimportant, with patients early in their illness responding better.METHODS: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single-dose crossoverstudy of modafinil 200 mg examined this with two cognitive batteries [MATRICSConsensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and Cambridge Neuropsychological TestAutomated Battery (CANTAB)] in 46 participants with under 3 years' duration ofDSM-IV schizophrenia, on stable antipsychotic medication. In parallel, the samedesign was used in 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy volunteers.Uncorrected p values were calculated using mixed effects models.RESULTS: In patients, modafinil significantly improved CANTAB Paired AssociateLearning, non-significantly improved efficiency and significantly slowedperformance of the CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge spatial planning task. There wasno significant effect on any MCCB domain. In healthy volunteers, modafinilsignificantly increased CANTAB Rapid Visual Processing, Intra-Extra DimensionalSet Shifting and verbal recall accuracy, and MCCB social cognition performance.The only significant differences between groups were in MCCB visual learning.CONCLUSIONS: As in earlier chronic schizophrenia studies, modafinil failed toproduce changes in cognition in early psychosis as measured by MCCB. CANTABproved more sensitive to the effects of modafinil in participants with earlyschizophrenia and in healthy volunteers. This confirms the importance ofselecting the appropriate test battery in treatment studies of cognition inschizophrenia.",RCT,,,,modafinil,placebo,,,schizophrenia,Cambridge Neuropsychological Test,

Interventions targeting attention orFAR per se have invariably yielded improved FAR performance in these patients.Here, we compared the effects of two interventions, one targeting FAR and onetargeting attention-to-facial-features, with treatment-as-usual on patients' FAR performance. Thirty-nine outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned toone of three groups: FAR intervention (training to recognize emotionalinformation, conveyed by changes in facial features),attention-to-facial-features intervention (training to detect changes in facialfeatures), and treatment-as-usual. Also, 24 healthy controls, matched for age andeducation, were assigned to one of the two interventions. Two FAR measurements,baseline and post-intervention, were conducted using an original experimentalprocedure with alternative sets of stimuli. We found improved FAR performancefollowing the intervention targeting FAR in comparison to the other patientgroups, which in fact was comparable to the pre-intervention performance ofhealthy controls in the corresponding intervention group. This improvement wasmore pronounced in recognizing fear. Our findings suggest that compared tointerventions targeting attention, and treatment-as-usual, training programstargeting FAR can be more effective in improving FAR in patients withschizophrenia, particularly assisting them in perceiving threat-relatedinformation more accurately.",RCT,,,,"training to recognize emotionalinformation, conveyed by changes in facial features","training to detect changes in facialfeatures",treatment-as-usual,,schizophrenia,facial affect recognition,
"Selective attention and mismatch negativity in antipsychotic-na__ve, first-episode schizophrenia patients before and after 6 months of antipsychotic monotherapy.",/pubmed/28443529,"BACKGROUND: Attention deficits have been frequently reported in schizophrenia. Ithas been suggested that treatment with second-generation antipsychotics canameliorate these deficits. In this study, the influence of 6 months treatmentwith quetiapine, a compound with less affinity for dopamine D2 receptors than forserotonergic 5-HT2A receptors, on electrophysiological parameters of attentionwas investigated in a group of antipsychotic-na´ve, first-episode schizophreniapatients compared with a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls.METHOD: A total of 34 first-episode, antipsychotic-na´ve patients withschizophrenia and an equal number of healthy controls were tested in a selective attention and a typical mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm at baseline and after 6 months. The patients were treated with quetiapine according to their clinicalneeds during the period between baseline and follow-up, whereas controls receivedno treatment.RESULTS: Patients showed lower MMN and P200 amplitude than healthy controls inthe selective attention paradigm at baseline, while this was not the case for MMNof the typical MMN paradigm. Interestingly, after 6 months treatment, this MMNdeficit was only ameliorated in patients treated with above median dosages ofquetiapine. Patients had lower P3B amplitude, yet showed similar levels ofprocessing negativity and N100 amplitude compared with healthy controls, both at baseline and follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that deficits in MMN, P200 and P3B amplitudeare present at early stages of schizophrenia, although depending on the paradigm used. Furthermore, the results indicate that 6 months quetiapine treatmentameliorates MMN but not P3B deficits, and only in those subjects on higherdosages.",RCT,,,,quetiapine,,,,schizophrenia,,check outcome
Thioredoxin is not a marker for treatment-resistance depression but associated with cognitive function: An rTMS study.,/pubmed/28442424,"Elevated oxidative stress is known to play an important role in development ofdepression and cognitive dysfunction. To date, thioredoxin (TRX), an antioxidant protein, has been investigated as a marker for psychiatric disorders such asschizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism but its relationship with depressionis yet to be unknown. The aim of this study is to detect the TRX levels inpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), analyse the effect of rTMS(repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) application on TRX levels anddisplay the relationship of TRX with cognitive areas. This study included 27treatment-resistant unipolar depression patients and 29 healthy subjects.Patients were evaluated by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), Hamilton AnxietyScale (HARS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after rTMSapplication. 23 of TRD patients were applied high-frequency rTMS over left DLPFC for 2 to 4weeks and plasma TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects weremeasured. No significant difference was determined between the TRX levels ofpatients and healthy subjects (p>0.05). After rTMS application there weresignificant decrease in severity of depression (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001),and explicit improvement in cognitive areas (delayed memory,visual-spatial/executive abilities and language points) (all p<0.05). Nodifference was detected in TRX levels of the patients after rTMS application(p>0.005). High language scores of the patients were found to be associated with high TRX levels (p<0.005). Our study indicates that TRX levels cannot be used as a marker for TRD or rTMS treatment in TRD. In spite of this TRX levels have apositive correlation with language functions of the patients of TRD.

Effects of low frequency rTMS treatment on brain networks for inner speech in patients with schizophrenia and auditory verbal hallucinations.,/pubmed/28442422,"INTRODUCTION: Efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)targeting the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) for the treatment of auditoryverbal hallucinations (AVH) remains under debate. We assessed the influence of a 1Hz rTMS treatment on neural networks involved in a cognitive mechanism proposed to subserve AVH.METHODS: Patients with schizophrenia (N=24) experiencing medication-resistant AVHcompleted a 10-day 1Hz rTMS treatment. Participants were randomized to activestimulation of the left or bilateral TPJ, or sham stimulation. The effects ofrTMS on neural networks were investigated with an inner speech task during fMRI. Changes within and between neural networks were analyzed using IndependentComponent Analysis.RESULTS: rTMS of the left and bilateral TPJ areas resulted in a weaker networkcontribution of the left supramarginal gyrus to the bilateral fronto-temporalnetwork. Left-sided rTMS resulted in stronger network contributions of the right superior temporal gyrus to the auditory-sensorimotor network, right inferiorgyrus to the left fronto-parietal network, and left middle frontal gyrus to thedefault mode network. Bilateral rTMS was associated with a predominant inhibitoryeffect on network contribution. Sham stimulation showed different patterns ofchange compared to active rTMS.CONCLUSION: rTMS of the left temporo-parietal region decreased the contributionof the left supramarginal gyrus to the bilateral fronto-temporal network, whichmay reduce the likelihood of speech intrusions. On the other hand, left rTMSappeared to increase the contribution of functionally connected regions involved in perception, cognitive control and self-referential processing. These findings hint to potential neural mechanisms underlying rTMS for hallucinations but needcorroboration in larger samples.",RCT,,,,active stimulation of the left or bilateral temporo-parietal junction,sham stimulation,,,schizophrenia,likelihood of speech intrusions,
Intranasal oxytocin does not modulate jumping to conclusions in schizophrenia: Potential interactions with caudate volume and baseline social functioning.,/pubmed/28431278,"BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) tend to sample less informationwhen making a decision, jumping to conclusions (JTC) without sufficient evidence.This ""JTC bias"" may be a trait marker of the disease and may not improve withantipsychotic treatment. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial totest whether intranasal oxytocin could reduce JTC in stable, medicated patientswith SCZ and healthy controls (HCs). We also explored whether striatal volume,clinical symptoms, and baseline social functioning (SF) was related to JTCperformance.METHODS: Forty-three male, medicated SCZ patients (Mean Age: 40.81±11.44) andsixteen HCs (Mean Age: 30.38±9.85) participated in a double-blind,placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Participants completed the Beads Task ontwo separate visits (minimum 20days apart). Participants were randomized toreceive either intranasal oxytocin (50IU in solution) or intranasal placebo(saline). Twenty of the SCZ patients and all sixteen HCs also provided T1 MRIs(3-T).RESULTS: Patients with SCZ took fewer draws to decision (DTD) than HCs(t(57)=2.78, p=0.007). Oxytocin did not significantly change DTD in patients(t(42)=-1.11, p=0.27), nor in HCs (t(15)=-0.62, p=0.55). Exploratory analysesfound ventral caudate volumes were negatively correlated with DTD (r(18)=-0.50,p=0.03) in patients. Moreover, oxytocin was more likely to improve JTC inpatients with lower baseline SF. However, these exploratory findings did notsurvive correction for multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONS: We replicate increased JTC in SCZ. However, acute intranasaloxytocin did not modify JTC. Future studies with larger samples should explorehow brain morphology and SF are related to JTC performance in patients with SCZ.",RCT,,,,oxytocin,placebo,,,schizophrenia,,check outcome
Incomes and Outcomes: Social Security Disability Benefits in First-Episode Psychosis.,/pubmed/28427286,"OBJECTIVE: Social Security Administration (SSA) disability benefits are animportant source of income for people with psychoses and confer eligibility forhealth insurance. The authors examined the impact of coordinated specialty careon receipt of such benefits in first-episode psychosis, along with the correlatesand consequences of receiving them.METHOD: The Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early TreatmentProgram (RAISE-ETP) study, a 34-site cluster-randomized trial, compared NAVIGATE,a coordinated specialty care program, to usual community care over 2 years.Receipt of SSA benefits and clinical outcomes were assessed at program entry and every 6 months for 2 years. Piecewise regression analysis was used to identifyrelative change in outcome trajectories after receipt of disability benefits.RESULTS: Among 399 RAISE-ETP participants, 36 (9%) were receiving SSA disability benefits at baseline; of the remainder, 124 (34.1%) obtained benefits during the 2-year study period. The NAVIGATE intervention improved quality of life,symptoms, and employment but did not significantly reduce the likelihood ofreceiving SSA disability benefits. Obtaining benefits was predicted by moresevere psychotic symptoms and greater dysfunction and was followed by increasedtotal income but fewer days of employment, reduced motivation (e.g., sense ofpurpose, greater anhedonia), and fewer days of intoxication.CONCLUSIONS: A 2-year coordinated specialty care intervention did not reducereceipt of SSA disability benefits. There were some advantages for those whoobtained SSA disability benefits over the 2-year treatment period, but there werealso some unintended adverse consequences. Providing income supports withoutimpeding recovery remains an important policy challenge.",RCT,,,,coordinated specialty care program,usual community care,,,Initial Schizophrenia,Piecewise regression analysis,

The purpose ofthis study was to investigate the effect of the atypical antipsychotic drugrisperidone on serum Hcy levels and to explore the relationship between thechanges in Hcy levels and the therapeutic outcome, which, to our best knowledgehave not been investigated. Fifty-six first-episode and drug-na´ve inpatientswith schizophrenia were assigned to a 12-week treatment regime with risperidone. Clinical efficacy was determined with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS). Serum Hcy levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay in schizophrenia patients before and after the 12-week treatment, and thevalues were compared with those of fifty-six age- and gender- matched healthycontrols. Serum Hcy levels were significantly higher in first-episode anddrug-na´ve patients than in control subjects (11.18±4.53 vs. 5.99±3.61_mol/L,F=37.195, df=1, p=1.73_10-8). Moreover, a significant positive correlationbetween Hcy levels and PANSS negative sub-score was observed (r=0.515;p=4.81_10-5). Serum Hcy levels were significantly decreased in patients afterrisperidone treatment (baseline: 11.18±4.53_mol/L vs. post-treatment:8.98±4.07_mol/L, t=3.857, p=3.034_10-4). At post-treatment, there was asignificant negative relationship between serum Hcy levels and PANSS negativesub-scores (r=-0.288, p=0.032). High Hcy levels at the onset of psychosissuggests that it may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and isrelated to clinical psychopathology.

Improved Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Schizophrenia During a Smoking Cessation Attempt with Varenicline and Behavioral Therapy.,/pubmed/28414583,"OBJECTIVE: Smoking prevalence rates are elevated in individuals withschizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) compared with the general population, withattendant disproportionate smoking-related morbidity and mortality.Pharmacotherapies that improve abstinence rates in this population areunderutilized, partly due to concerns about neuropsychiatric safety, particularlyfor those with comorbid depression or prior suicide attempt. Prospectiveassessment of the psychiatric safety profile of varenicline in those with SSD is needed.METHODS: Adult smokers with SSD entered a 12-week trial of varenicline andbehavioral therapy for smoking cessation. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) at baseline and weeklythereafter. Participants with baseline and one or more postbaseline CDSSassessments, n = 179, were included in a secondary analysis of change indepressive symptoms with varenicline treatment, adjusting for abstinence statusand baseline depressive symptoms.RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of participants had a CDSS score at baselineconsistent with current major depressive disorder, and more than half had a priorsuicide attempt. Forty-one percent (74/179) achieved two or more weeks ofcontinuous abstinence at the end of treatment. CDSS scores declined 31% duringthe 12-week treatment period. Controlling for baseline CDSS scores, depressivesymptoms declined over time in those who completed the trial, independent ofabstinence status, and either declined or remained unchanged in those with major depressive disorder or prior suicide attempt or who were taking antidepressantmedication. Those who did not complete the trial had no change in depressivesymptoms.DISCUSSION: Depressive symptoms declined in adults with schizophrenia during 12weeks of varenicline treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, independent oftobacco abstinence. Smokers with SSD who have significant depressive symptoms maybe successful in smoking cessation attempts with pharmacotherapeutic aids such asvarenicline while maintaining stable psychiatric symptoms.

"Methylomic changes in individuals with psychosis, prenatally exposed to endocrine disrupting compounds: Lessons from diethylstilbestrol.",/pubmed/28406917,"BACKGROUND: In the Western world, between 1940 and 1970, more than 2 millionpeople were exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES). In exposed individuals,and in their descendants, adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure,including cancers, genital malformations, and less consistently, psychiatricdisorders. We aimed to explore whether prenatal DES exposure would be associated with DNA methylation changes, and whether these epigenetic modifications would beassociated with increased risk of psychosis.METHODS: From 247 individuals born from mothers exposed to DES, we selected 69siblings from 30 families. In each family, at least one sibling was exposed inutero to DES. We performed a methylome-wide association study usingHumanMethylation450 DNA Analysis BeadChipÂ in peripheral blood. We analyzedmethylation changes at individual CpGs or regions in exposed (n = 37) versusunexposed individuals (n = 32). We also compared exposed individuals with (n = 7)and without psychosis (n = 30).RESULTS: There were more individuals with schizophrenia in the DES-exposed group.We found no significant differences between exposed and unexposed individualswith respect to differentially methylated CpGs or regions. The largest differencewas in a region near the promoter of an ADAMTS proteoglycanase gene (ADAMTS9).Compared to exposed individuals without psychosis, exposed individuals withpsychosis had differential methylation in the region encompassing the geneencoding the zinc finger protein 57 (ZFP57).CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to DES was not associated with methylation changesat specific CpG or regions. In exposed individuals, however, psychosis wasassociated with specific methylomic modifications that could impactneurodevelopment and neuroplasticity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
No age effect in the prevalence and clinical significance of ultra-high risk symptoms and criteria for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome: Confirmation of the genetically driven risk for psychosis?,/pubmed/28406913,"BACKGROUND: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is one of the highest knownrisk factors for schizophrenia. Thus, the detection of 22q11DS patients atparticularly high risk of psychosis is important, yet studies on the clinicalsignificance of the widely used ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria in 22q11DS areinconclusive. Since age was reported to moderate clinical significance of UHRsymptoms in community samples, we explored whether age at presentation of UHRsymptoms and criteria may explain part of this heterogeneity.METHODS: 111 patients with 22q11DS (8-30 years; 15.7±4.7) were assessed for UHRsymptoms/criteria. Information on diagnoses, psychosocial functioning, and IQwere collected.RESULTS: Any UHR symptom was reported by 38.7%, any UHR criterion by 27%. Nosignificant influence of age on the prevalence of UHR symptoms or criteria wasdetected. Moreover, age did not significantly modulate the association betweenUHR symptoms and functioning. However, significant interaction terms suggestedthat younger age groups were more likely to meet UHR criteria in the presence of UHR symptoms compared to the adult group.DISCUSSION: Compared to the general population, prevalence of UHR symptoms andcriteria was 3.8-fold and 20.8-fold in our 22q11DS sample. Contrary to thegeneral population, age only modulated the prevalence of UHR criteria among thosewith UHR symptoms, but not their prevalence per se or their clinicalsignificance. This suggests that UHR symptoms might develop as a trait factor in terms of a genetically driven schizotypal disposition in 22q11DS, thusnecessitating future studies on psychosis-risk indicators in this genetichigh-risk group.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Two subgroups of antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients identified with a Gaussian mixture model on cognition and electrophysiology.",/pubmed/28398342,"Deficits in information processing and cognition are among the most robustfindings in schizophrenia patients. Previous efforts to translate group-leveldeficits into clinically relevant and individualized information have, however,been non-successful, which is possibly explained by biologically differentdisease subgroups. We applied machine learning algorithms on measures ofelectrophysiology and cognition to identify potential subgroups of schizophrenia.Next, we explored subgroup differences regarding treatment response. Sixty-sixantipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and sixty-five healthycontrols underwent extensive electrophysiological and neurocognitive testbatteries. Patients were assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS) before and after 6 weeks of monotherapy with the relatively selective D2 receptor antagonist, amisulpride (280.3±159_mg per day). A reduced principalcomponent space based on 19 electrophysiological variables and 26 cognitivevariables was used as input for a Gaussian mixture model to identify subgroups ofpatients. With support vector machines, we explored the relation between PANSSsubscores and the identified subgroups. We identified two statistically distinct subgroups of patients. We found no significant baseline psychopathologicaldifferences between these subgroups, but the effect of treatment in the groupswas predicted with an accuracy of 74.3% (P=0.003). In conclusion,electrophysiology and cognition data may be used to classify subgroups ofschizophrenia patients. The two distinct subgroups, which we identified, werepsychopathologically inseparable before treatment, yet their response todopaminergic blockade was predicted with significant accuracy. This proof ofprinciple encourages further endeavors to apply data-driven, multivariate andmultimodal models to facilitate progress from symptom-based psychiatry towardindividualized treatment regimens.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The efficacy of sodium benzoate as an adjunctive treatment in early psychosis - CADENCE-BZ: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28388932,"BACKGROUND: Psychotic disorders affect up to 3% of the population and are oftenchronic and disabling. Innovation in the pharmacological treatment of psychosishas remained stagnant in recent decades. In order to improve outcomes for thosewith psychotic disorders, we present a protocol for the trial of a common foodpreservative, sodium benzoate, as an adjunctive treatment in early psychosis.METHODS: Persons experiencing early psychosis (n_=_160) will be recruited throughhospitals and community mental health services in Queensland, Australia. Patientswill be randomized to receive either 12-week treatment with 1000¾mg (500¾mg twicedaily (BD)) sodium benzoate or placebo. Patients will undergo fortnightly outcomeassessments, in addition to weekly ongoing capacity to consent, drug complianceand safety assessments. The primary outcome measure is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score.

Aripiprazole Once-Monthly in the Treatment of Acute Psychotic Episodes in Schizophrenia: Post Hoc Analysis of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Marder Factor Scores.,/pubmed/28383362,"BACKGROUND: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are treatment options for acuteand long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In a previously published12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patientswith schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic episode, aripiprazoleonce-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) produced significantly greater improvement thanplacebo on the primary endpoint, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)total score at week 10.METHODS: To examine the efficacy of AOM 400 across a broader representation ofschizophrenia symptoms, including agitation, a post hoc analysis of this trialwas carried out to assess the change in PANSS Marder factor domains (positivesymptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolledhostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression) and the PANSS excited component(equivalent to Marder factor domain uncontrolled hostility/excitement plus thetension item) by comparing differences in change from baseline between AOM 400and placebo using a mixed model for repeated measures.RESULTS: The differences between treatment and placebo for all factors werestatistically significant, with improvements seen as early as week 1 or 2, andmaintained through week 12. Thus, AOM 400, supplemented with oral aripiprazole inthe first 2 weeks, showed significantly greater efficacy versus placebo inacutely ill patients with schizophrenia in all 5 Marder illness domains, as well as in agitation as conceptualized by the PANSS excited component score.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that AOM 400 is efficacious across thespectrum of schizophrenia symptoms in acutely ill patients, with implications forboth short-term and, by extension, long-term patient outcomes.",RCT,,,,aripiprazole,placebo,,,schizophrenia,Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,
Rationale and design of the PLACID study: a randomised trial comparing the efficacy and safety of inhaled loxapine versus IM aripiprazole in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.,/pubmed/28376877,"BACKGROUND: The management of acute agitation manifesting in patients withschizophrenia or bipolar disorder requires swift pharmacological intervention to provide rapid symptomatic relief and prevent escalation to aggression andviolence. Antipsychotic medications are widely used in this setting and theavailability of an inhaled formulation with deep lung absorption of theantipsychotic loxapine has the potential to deliver a faster onset of therapeuticeffect than the available intramuscular formulations of antipsychotics.METHODS: The efficacy of inhaled loxapine and the alternative antipsychoticaripiprazole delivered via intramuscular (IM) injection will be compared in thePhase IIIb PLACID study. Adults (18-65¾years) with a confirmed diagnosis ofschizophrenia or bipolar I disorder presenting with acute agitation will berandomly assigned to open-label treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Clinical evaluationwill be conducted by raters blinded to treatment assignment. The primary efficacyendpoint is time to response (defined as a Clinical Global Impression ofImprovement [CGI-I] score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved]).Secondary endpoints will include the percentage of responders at different timepoints after dosing; the proportion of patients who receive 1 or 2 doses of studydrug; time to second dose; time to rescue medication; satisfaction with studydrug (evaluated using Item 14 of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire forMedication); and safety and tolerability. Approximately 360 patients will berecruited with an interim analysis conducted once 180 patients have completed thestudy to decide whether to stop for futility or continue with or without anincrease in the sample size up to additional 288 patients.DISCUSSION: The PLACID trial will assess the efficacy and safety of inhaledloxapine with deep lung absorption compared with the IM antipsychotic,aripiprazole, in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or bipolardisorder. In the event that the median time to response of inhaled loxapine issignificantly shorter than that of the intramuscular aripiprazole, the PLACIDstudy has the potential to support the inhaled antipsychotic therapy as thestandard of care in this setting.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered with the European Clinical Trials Database on the 31 October 2014 (EudraCT number 2014-000456-29 ).",Protocol,,Y,,loxapine,aripiprazole,,,schizophrenia or bipolar disorder ,time to response,

Study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of user-driven intervention to prevent aggressive events in psychiatric services.,/pubmed/28372555,"BACKGROUND: People admitted to psychiatric hospitals with a diagnosis ofschizophrenia may display behavioural problems. These may require managementapproaches such as use of coercive practices, which impact the well-being ofstaff members, visiting families and friends, peers, as well as patientsthemselves. Studies have proposed that not only patients' conditions, but alsotreatment environment and ward culture may affect patients' behaviour. Seclusion and restraint could possibly be prevented with staff education aboutuser-centred, more humane approaches. Staff education could also increasecollaboration between patients, family members and staff, which may furtherpositively affect treatment culture and lower the need for using coercivetreatment methods.METHODS: This is a single-blind, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trialinvolving 28 psychiatric hospital wards across Finland. Units will be randomised to receive either a staff educational programme delivered by the team ofresearchers, or standard care. The primary outcome is the incidence of use ofpatient seclusion rooms, assessed from the local/national health registers.Secondary outcomes include use of other coercive methods (limb restraint, forced injection, and physical restraint), service use, treatment satisfaction, general functioning among patients, and team climate and employee turn-over (nursingstaff).DISCUSSION: The study, designed in close collaboration with staff members,patients and their relatives, will provide evidence for a co-operative anduser-centred educational intervention aiming to decrease the prevalence ofcoercive methods and service use in the units, increase the functional status of patients and improve team climate in the units.

There were no significanttreatment-related improvements in neuropsychological performance.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: FAST may lead to an increase inself-efficacy and cognitive strategy use, as well as a reduction in academicdifficulties among students with psychiatric conditions. Future analyses withfollow-up data through 12 months will address the potential of FAST to improveacademic functioning among this population.

Supplementing intensive targeted computerized cognitive training with social cognitive exercises for people with schizophrenia: An interim report.,/pubmed/28368179,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive, socialcognitive, and motivational deficits that contribute to impairment in real-world functioning. In the current study, we investigated the effects of supplementingcomputerized neurocognitive training with social cognitive exercises, as comparedwith neurocognitive training alone.METHOD: In this ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 111participants with psychosis, we compare the effects of supplementing intensivetargeted cognitive training with social cognitive training exercises (TCT + SCT) with the effects of targeted cognitive training alone (TCT-only). Participantswere assessed on cognition, symptoms, functional capacity, and functionaloutcomes, as well as social cognition and measures related to reward processing.RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in multiplecognitive domains and improvement in functional capacity. However, as predicted, TCT + SCT group participants showed significant improvement in prosodyidentification and reward processing relative to TCT-only participants.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings indicate thatsupplementing intensive computerized cognitive training with social cognitiveexercises in people with psychosis confers greater benefits in prosodyidentification and reward processing relative to cognitive training alone, eventhough both approaches drive significant improvements in cognition and functionalcapacity. Impairments in both prosody identification and reward processing havebeen associated with greater negative symptoms and poorer functional outcomes in schizophrenia, raising the possibility that this form of treatment may lead tobetter long-term outcomes than traditional cognitive training approaches.Follow-up assessments will determine whether results are durable and generalizeover time to improvements in symptoms and functioning.

Feasibility and Efficacy of Brief Computerized Training to Improve Emotion Recognition in Premanifest and Early-Symptomatic Huntington's Disease.,/pubmed/28357975,"OBJECTIVES: Deficits in the recognition of negative emotions emerge beforeclinical diagnosis in Huntington's disease (HD). To address emotion recognitiondeficits, which have been shown in schizophrenia to be improved by computerizedtraining, we conducted a study of the feasibility and efficacy of computerizedtraining of emotion recognition in HD.METHODS: We randomly assigned 22 individuals with premanifest or earlysymptomatic HD to the training or control group. The training group used aself-guided online training program, MicroExpression Training Tool (METT), twice weekly for 4 weeks. All participants completed measures of emotion recognition atbaseline and post-training time-points. Participants in the training group alsocompleted training adherence measures.RESULTS: Participants in the training group completed seven of the eight sessionson average. Results showed a significant group by time interaction, indicatingthat METT training was associated with improved accuracy in emotion recognition.CONCLUSIONS: Although sample size was small, our study demonstrates that emotion recognition remediation using the METT is feasible in terms of trainingadherence. The evidence also suggests METT may be effective in premanifest orearly-symptomatic HD, opening up a potential new avenue for intervention. Furtherstudy with a larger sample size is needed to replicate these findings, and tocharacterize the durability and generalizability of these improvements, and theirimpact on functional outcomes in HD.

Accuracy of Clinician Assessments of Medication Status in the Emergency Setting: A Comparison of Clinician Assessment of Antipsychotic Usage and Plasma Level Determination.,/pubmed/28353490,"PURPOSE: The present study aimed to assess the level of agreement betweenclinicians' routine assessments of medication status and plasma levels ofcommonly prescribed antipsychotic medications in patients presenting to anemergency room with an exacerbation of psychosis.METHODS: We studied 105 patients presenting to an emergency room and admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified and aprior outpatient medication regimen including risperidone, olanzapine,quetiapine, aripiprazole, or paliperidone. Plasma levels of antipsychotics weredrawn and sent to a specialty laboratory for testing.FINDINGS: Of the 97 patients with usable samples, 33 (34%) were found to havetherapeutic antipsychotic levels. Of these, 22 were judged by emergency roomstaff to be taking their medications at the appropriately prescribed doses,whereas 11 were judged not to be taking medication at all. Sixty-four patientswere found to have subtherapeutic antipsychotic levels, 31 of whom had beenassessed to be taking medication as prescribed. Emergency assessment ofmedication status predicted therapeutic and nontherapeutic antipsychotic levelsat rates of 41.5% and 75%, respectively. Emergency staff assessment wasstatistically independent from the likelihood of having a therapeuticantipsychotic level.IMPLICATIONS: In patients presenting to emergency rooms with exacerbations ofpsychosis who are subsequently admitted to an inpatient facility, commonassessments of medication status are frequently misleading. Readily availablemethods for rapidly measuring antipsychotic plasma levels in clinical settingsare needed for clinicians to make reliable assessments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Systemic inflammation enhances stimulant-induced striatal dopamine elevation.,/pubmed/28350401,"Changes in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system are implicated in a range ofneuropsychiatric conditions including addiction, depression and schizophrenia.Dysfunction of the neuroimmune system is often comorbid with such conditions and affects similar areas of the brain. The goal of this study was to use positronemission tomography with the dopamine D2 antagonist tracer, 11C-raclopride, toexplore the effect of acute immune activation on striatal DA levels. DAtransmission was modulated by an oral methylphenidate (MP) challenge in order to reliably elicit DA elevation. Elevation in DA concentration due to MP wasestimated via change in 11C-raclopride binding potential from the baseline scan. Prior to the post-MP scan, subjects were pre-treated with either the immuneactivator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or placebo (PBO) in a cross-over design.Immune activation was confirmed by measuring tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF_), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentration in plasma. Eight healthy subjects were scanned four times each to determine the MP-induced DA elevation under both LPSand PBO pre-treatment conditions. MP-induced DA elevation in the striatum wassignificantly greater (P<0.01) after LPS pre-treatment compared to PBOpre-treatment. Seven of eight subjects responded similarly. This effect wasobserved in the caudate and putamen (P<0.02), but was not present in ventralstriatum. DA elevation induced by MP was significantly greater when subjects werepre-treated with LPS compared to PBO. The amplification of stimulant-induced DAsignaling in the presence of systemic inflammation may have importantimplications for our understanding of addiction and other diseases of DAdysfunction.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Is serum angiotensin converting enzyme level a useful non-invasive marker for liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C?,/pubmed/29641775,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be a critical problem. Theliver fibrosis score is the most valuable tool in determining treatment andprognosis. Liver biopsy is still considered a gold method but, due to unmetneeds, new non-invasive markers are required. The aim of this study was toinvestigate any possible relationship between serum angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) levels and the stages of liver fibrosis in patients with CHC.METHOD: A total 100 CHC and 100 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Therelationship between serum ACE level and the stages liver fibrosis wasinvestigated using three different formats, as follows: (group [G]-I, classicIshak's Score from F1 to F6; G-II, mild [F1-2], moderate [F3-4] and severe[F5-6]; G-III, mild [_ F2] and advanced [F > 2]). The clinical usability of serumACE level for both groups was also investigated.RESULTS: Median serum ACE levels were higher in the healthy group than in CHC(42.5 [7-119] vs. 36 [7-91] U/I, p=0.002). There was no statistical differenceamong the three different fibrosis groups (G-I, G-II, G-III, p=0.797, p=0.986,and p=0.874) and no correlation between serum ACE level and the stages of liverfibrosis (r=0.026, p=0.923).

The primary end point was a sustainedvirological response (HCV RNA_<_15¾IU/mL), observed 12¾weeks after the end of thetreatment (SVR12).RESULTS: Among all patients, the treatment-experienced patients with SOF plusOBV/PTV/r_+_RBV had a higher SVR12 rate (97%; 109/113). Further, SVR12 wasachieved by 98% (81/83) of non-cirrhotic patients and 93% (28/30) of cirrhoticpatients. Additionally, the most common adverse events reported included fatigue,headache, insomnia, nausea, and dyspnea.CONCLUSIONS: The recent multi-targeted regimen of SOF plus OBV/PTV/r_+_RBV waswell tolerated and achieved excellent SVR rates among retreatment-experiencedEgyptian patients with prior DAA treatments failure, thus providing analternative regimen for the retreatment of difficult-to-cure HCV GT4 patients.",Single arm,Y,,,"sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) plus ribavirin (RBV)",,,,chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4,"sustained virological response (HCV RNA_<_15_IU/mL), observed 12_weeks after the end of the treatment (SVR12)",
Effectiveness of first-wave protease inhibitors in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection: a multicenter study in Brazil.,/pubmed/29513836,"INTRODUCTION: In 2013, combination therapy using peginterferon, ribavirin, andboceprevir or telaprevir was introduced to treat hepatitis C virus genotype 1infection in Brazil. The effectiveness of this therapy in four Brazilian regions was evaluated.METHODS: Clinical and virological data were obtained from patients of publichealth institutions in five cities, including sustained virological response(SVR) and side effects. Patients with advanced fibrosis (F3/4), moderate fibrosis(F2) for > 3 years, or extra-hepatic manifestations were treated according toMinistry of Health protocol. Treatment effectiveness was verified by usingbivariate and multivariate analysis; p-values of < 0.05 were consideredsignificant.RESULTS: Of 275 patients (64.7% men; average age, 57 years old), most (61.8%)were treatment-experienced; 53.9% had subgenotype 1a infection, 85.1% hadadvanced fibrosis, and 85.5% were treated with telaprevir. SVR was observed in54.2%. Rapid virological response (RVR) was observed in 54.6% of patients (dataavailable for 251 patients). Overall, 87.5% reported side effects and 42.5% didnot complete treatment. Skin rash, severe infection, and death occurred in 17.8%,2.5%, and death in 1.4% of cases, respectively. SVR was associated with treatmentcompletion, RVR, and anemia.CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of hepatitis C virus triple therapy was lower thanthat reported in phase III clinical trials, possibly owing to the prioritizedtreatment of patients with advanced liver fibrosis.

The characteristics of residents with unawareness of hepatitis C virus infection in community.,/pubmed/29470547,"BACKGROUND: Control of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is an increasinglyimportant issue. Enhancing screening coverage is necessary to discover more HCVinfected subjects in community. However, a substantial population is unaware ofHCV infection that needs more attention.AIM: The aims of this study were to evaluate the status of HCV infected residentsin remote villages, to compare characteristics between already known and unaware HCV infection subjects, and to analyze the disease insights.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Screening intervention for liver diseases was conducted in remote villages of Tainan City of southern Taiwan from August 2014 to July 2016. Items of screening examinations included questionnaire, blood sampling for liver tests and viral hepatitis markers (hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCVantibody), abdominal sonography survey, and liver stiffness measurement bytransient elastography. Quantitation of HCV RNA was measured for residents withpositive anti-HCV antibody.RESULTS: A total of 194 (13.5%) out of 1439 participants showed positive foranti-HCV antibody. HCV viremia was detected in 119 (61.3%) residents. Previously unaware HCV infection by questionnaire record was present in 68 (35.1%) ofant-HCV positive residents. By multivariate logistic analysis, unaware HCVinfected residents exhibited significantly mild liver fibrosis (OR 0.876, 95% CI 0.782~0.981, p = 0.022), more prevalent of heart diseases (OR 6.082, 95% CI1.963~18.839, p = 0.002), and less cluster of family history of liver diseases(OR 0.291, 95% CI 0.113~0.750, p = 0.011) when comparing with already known HCVinfected residents. Among the 126 already know HCV infected residents, only 59(46.8%) received antiviral treatment or regular follow-up. No concept or nowilling to receive medical care was observed in 44 (34.9%) residents.CONCLUSION: In HCV endemic villages of Taiwan, residents with unaware HCVinfection comprised about one third of HCV infected residents and exhibitedobscure characteristics to identify. Less than half of already known HCV infectedresidents received adequate medical care. To eliminate HCV infection, vigorousefforts on enhancing screening coverage, educating update knowledge of liverdiseases, and linking to medical care are urgently needed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Rationale, design, and methodology of a trial evaluating three models of care for HCV treatment among injection drug users on opioid agonist therapy.",/pubmed/29426304,"BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) constitute 60% of the approximately 5 million people in the U.S. infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment ofPWID is complex due to addiction, mental illness, poverty, homelessness, lack of positive social support, poor adherence-related skills, low motivation andknowledge, and poor access to and trust in the health care system. Newdirect-acting antiviral medications are available for HCV with high cure ratesand few side effects. The life expectancy and economic benefits of new HCVtreatments will not be realized unless we determine optimal models of care forthe majority of HCV-infected patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluatethe effectiveness of directly observed therapy and group treatment compared with self-administered individual treatment in a large, urban opioid agonist therapyclinic setting in the Bronx, New York.METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial 150 PWID with chronic HCVwere recruited from opioid agonist treatment (OAT) clinics and randomized to one of three models of onsite HCV treatment in OAT: 1) modified directly observedtherapy; 2) group treatment; or 3) control - self-administered individualtreatment. Participants were age 18 or older, HCV genotype 1, English or Spanish speaking, treatment na´ve (or treatment experienced after 12/3/14), willing toreceive HCV treatment onsite, receiving methadone or buprenorphine at themedication window at least once per week, and able to provide informed consent.Outcomes of interest include adherence (as measured by self-report and electronicblister packs), HCV treatment completion, sustained virologic response, drugresistance, and cost-effectiveness.DISCUSSION: This paper describes the design and rationale of a randomizedcontrolled trial comparing three models of care for HCV therapy delivered in anopioid agonist treatment program. Our trial will be critical to rigorouslyidentify models of care that result in high adherence and cure rates. Use ofblister pack technology will help us determine the role of adherence insuccessful cure of HCV. Moreover, the trial methodology outlined here can serveas a template for the development of future programs and studies amongHCV-infected drug users receiving opioid agonist therapy, as well as thecost-effectiveness of such programs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01857245 ).

Glecaprevir-Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV Genotype 1 or 3 Infection.,/pubmed/29365309,"BACKGROUND: Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents with pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance. We evaluated the efficacyand safety of 8-week and 12-week courses of treatment with 300 mg of glecaprevir plus 120 mg of pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis who had hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) genotype 1 or 3 infection.METHODS: We conducted two phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter trials.Patients with genotype 1 infection were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio toreceive once-daily glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for either 8 or 12 weeks. Patientswith genotype 3 infection were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 12weeks of treatment with either glecaprevir-pibrentasvir orsofosbuvir-daclatasvir. Additional patients with genotype 3 infection weresubsequently enrolled and nonrandomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of treatmentwith glecaprevir-pibrentasvir. The primary end point was the rate of sustainedvirologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment.RESULTS: In total, 1208 patients were treated. The rate of sustained virologicresponse at 12 weeks among genotype 1-infected patients was 99.1% (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 98 to 100) in the 8-week group and 99.7% (95% CI, 99 to 100) inthe 12-week group. Genotype 3-infected patients who were treated for 12 weeks hada rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 98; 222 of 233 patients) with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir and 97% (95% CI, 93 to 99.9; 111of 115) with sofosbuvir-daclatasvir; 8 weeks of treatment withglecaprevir-pibrentasvir yielded a rate of 95% (95% CI, 91 to 98; 149 of 157patients). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in no more than 1% of patients in any treatment group.CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily treatment with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for either 8weeks or 12 weeks achieved high rates of sustained virologic response amongpatients with HCV genotype 1 or 3 infection who did not have cirrhosis.

Measuring Adherence to Hepatitis C Direct-Acting Antiviral Medications: Using the VAS in an HCV Treatment Clinic.,/pubmed/29298369,"OBJECTIVES: To implement the widespread treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV),validated self-report measures to assess medication adherence are needed formonitoring patients who are prescribed HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). TheVisual Analog Scale (VAS) is an efficient and well-validated tool for measuringadherence to antiretrovirals in human immunodeficiency virus populations. Thisstudy compared VAS scores with pill counts and serum levels of HCV RNA in asample of HCV-infected veterans prescribed DAAs.METHODS: Veterans initiating HCV DAAs were offered enrollment in our study. HCVtreatment was prescribed in accordance with the standard of care. Follow-up studyvisits were scheduled every 28 days for a total of 12 weeks. Adherence to DAAswas assessed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 using pill counts and the VAS score. Serumlevels of HCV RNA were measured at baseline, week 4 of DAA therapy, and week 12(Ampliprep/Taqman, lower limit of quantification 43 IU/mL).RESULTS: Between May 2013 and December 2014, 30 veterans were enrolled. Meanadherence via pill count at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (96.2%, 95.2%, and 98.2%,respectively) was nearly identical to the mean VAS scores (96.2%, 96.0%, and98.2%, respectively). Wilcoxon signed rank tests demonstrated no differencesbetween each VAS and pill count pair. The VAS score inversely correlated with HCVviral load 4 weeks after DAA initiation (r -0.98) and at 12 weeks of treatment (r-0.97).CONCLUSIONS: The VAS score compared favorably with objective measures ofadherence. If future studies confirm our results, then the VAS will provide asimple and reliable method of assessing adherence to HCV DAAs in real-worldtreatment clinics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Efficacy of Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Treatment of HCV Infection in Patients Coinfected With HBV.,/pubmed/29174546,"ACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been reports of reactivation of hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection during treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection withdirect-acting antiviral agents. We performed a prospective study of risks andoutcomes of HCV infection treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in patientswith HBV infection.METHODS: We performed a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label study in Taiwan of 111 patients with HCV infection (61% HCV genotype 1, 39% HCV genotype 2 infection;62% women, 16% with compensated cirrhosis) along with HBV infection. All but 1were positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 1 patient who wasHBsAg-positive at screening was found to be HBsAg-negative at baseline. Overall, 33% of participants had received prior treatment for HCV and 5% had previouslybeen treated for HBV; no patient was on HBV therapy at the start of the study.All patients received a fixed-dose combination of 90 mg of the HCV NS5A inhibitorledipasvir with 400 mg of the NS5B nucleotide analogue inhibitor sofosbuvir, oncedaily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12weeks after the end of therapy.RESULTS: All 111 patients (100%) achieved a sustained virologic response. Of the 37 patients with baseline HBV DNA below 20 IU/mL, 31 (84%) had at least 1 episodeof quantifiable HBV DNA through posttreatment week 12. Of the 74 patients withbaseline HBV DNA levels of 20 IU/mL or more, 39 (53%) had increases of HBV DNAgreater than 1 log10 IU/mL through posttreatment week 12. Overall, 5 patients hadincreased levels of HBV DNA concomitant with a level of alanine aminotransferase >2 times the upper limit of normal through posttreatment week 12. Of these, 3patients started HBV treatment. In addition, 1 patient with HBV reactivationsince week 8 and concomitant alanine aminotransferase elevation >2 times upperlimit of normal at posttreatment week 48 started treatment at posttreatment week 53. This patient had clinical signs and symptoms associated with HBVreactivation. The most common adverse events were headache, upper respiratoryinfection, and fatigue.CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study, the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvirfor 12 weeks produced a sustained virologic response in 100% of patients with HCVinfection who were coinfected with HBV. Most patients had an increase in level ofHBV DNA not associated with signs or symptoms.

Randomized clinical trial of hepatic resection versus radiofrequency ablation for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.,/pubmed/29091283,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are treatmentoptions for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether tumour recurrenceand long-term survival favour either treatment has not been established. Thisrandomized trial aimed to test the hypothesis that RFA is superior to hepaticresection in terms of lower tumour recurrence rate and better long-term survival.METHODS: Patients with early-stage HCC (solitary tumour no larger than 5_cm; orno more than 3 tumours, each 3_cm or smaller) were randomized into hepaticresection and RFA groups. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and short-and long-term outcome measures were compared between groups. Primary andsecondary outcome measures were overall tumour recurrence and survivalrespectively.RESULTS: Clinicopathological data were similar in the two groups, which eachcontained 109 patients. The RFA group had a shorter treatment duration, lessblood loss and shorter hospital stay than the resection group. Mortality andmorbidity rates were similar in the two groups. The overall tumour recurrencerate was similar in the resection and RFA groups (71à3 versus 81à7 per centrespectively). The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 94à5, 80à6,66à5 and 47à6 per cent respectively in the resection group, compared with 95à4,82à3, 66à4 and 41à8 per cent in the RFA group (P_=_0à531).

Open Label Study of 8 vs. 12 Weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in Genotype 6 Treatment Na__ve or Experienced Patients.,/pubmed/29087397,"OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis C genotype 6 (HCV-GT6) is one of the most prevalentgenotypes in Southeast Asia. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination(LDV/SOF FDC) for 12 weeks has been shown to be effective for multiple HCVgenotypes including treatment-na´ve HCV-6. Our goal was to examine treatmentoutcomes in a diverse HCV-6 population.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 60 HCV-GT6 patients at four US centers.Treatment -na´ve without cirrhosis patients received open-labeled LDV/SOF FDCorally once a day for 8 weeks; All cirrhotic and/or treatment-experiencedpatients received LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was sustainedvirological response 12 weeks after therapy (SVR12). Secondary outcomes wereadverse events (AEs) and/or serious adverse events (SAEs). All patients gavewritten consent.RESULTS: Overall mean age was 58±10 and 58% were male. All patients were Asianand foreign born. The 8-week group included 20 patients (33.3%) and the 12-weekincluded 40 patients (66.7%).

Interferon-free therapy with direct acting antivirals for HCV/HIV-1 co-infected Japanese patients with inherited bleeding disorders.,/pubmed/29045448,"INTRODUCTION: Almost 30 years ago, about 30% of Japanese hemophiliacs becameinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) after receiving contaminatedblood products. While several studies have reported the high efficacy and safety of direct acting antivirals (DAA) in HIV-1 co-infected patients, such data arelimited in hemophiliacs.METHODS: We conducted a single-center, open-label study involving 27 Japanesepatients (median age; 45 years) with inherited bleeding disorders who wereco-infected with HCV/HIV-1. Patients with HCV genotype 1 (GT1) and GT4 receivedledipasvir (90 mg) plus sofosbuvir (400 mg), those with HCV GT2 receivedsofosbuvir plus weight-based ribavirin, and those with HCV GT3 receiveddaclatasvir (60 mg) plus sofosbuvir. Treatment was continued for 12 weeks in all patients. The primary endpoints were rate of sustained virologic response at 12weeks after end of therapy (SVR12) and occurrence of adverse events during DAAtherapy.RESULTS: Eighteen (67%) patients had had received interferon-based therapy, and11 (41%) had compensated cirrhosis. HCV genotypes were GT1a 4 (15%), GT1b 16(59%), GT1 undetermined 2 (7%), GT2a 1 (4%), GT3a 3 (11%) and GT4a 1 (4%). Allpatients were on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and had undetectableHIV-1 viral load (<20 copies/_L) at baseline. All patients achieved SVR12.Serious adverse events were observed in 3 patients: arteritis of the leg, whichresolved after completion of DAA therapy, asymptomatic QT prolongation andgastrointestinal hemorrhage. cART failure was noted in one patient due toemergence of raltegravir resistance during ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment.Although _-fetoprotein, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), and Fibro Scan (FS) scores decreased in most patients during DAA therapy, M2BPGi(>2.0 cutoff index) and FS scores (>15.0 kPa) were still high in 6 patients atweek 36.CONCLUSIONS: DAA therapy is effective in all patients.

Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir in Patients with HCV and Severe Renal Impairment.,/pubmed/29020583,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is more prevalent amongpatients who have chronic kidney disease than among those who do not have thedisease. Patients with chronic kidney disease who also have HCV infection are at higher risk for progression to end-stage renal disease than those who havechronic kidney disease without HCV infection. Patients with both HCV infectionand advanced chronic kidney disease have limited treatment options.METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial to evaluate theefficacy and safety of treatment with the combination of the NS3/4A proteaseinhibitor glecaprevir and the NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir for 12 weeks in adults who had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and also had compensated liverdisease (with or without cirrhosis) with severe renal impairment, dependence ondialysis, or both. Patients had stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and eitherhad received no previous treatment for HCV infection or had received previoustreatment with interferon or pegylated interferon, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, or acombination of these medications. The primary end point was a sustained virologicresponse 12 weeks after the end of treatment.RESULTS: Among the 104 patients enrolled in the trial, 52% had genotype 1infection, 16% had genotype 2 infection, 11% had genotype 3 infection, 19% hadgenotype 4 infection, and 2% had genotype 5 or 6 infection. The sustainedvirologic response rate was 98% (102 of 104 patients; 95% confidence interval, 95to 100). No patients had virologic failure during treatment, and no patients had a virologic relapse after the end of treatment. Adverse events that were reportedin at least 10% of the patients were pruritus, fatigue, and nausea. Seriousadverse events were reported in 24% of the patients. Four patients discontinuedthe trial treatment prematurely because of adverse events; three of thesepatients had a sustained virologic response.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks resulted ina high rate of sustained virologic response in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronickidney disease and HCV infection.

Clinicopathological features of primary splenic follicular lymphoma.,/pubmed/28975390,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade lymphoma that is usually characterized bygeneralized lymphadenopathy. Extranodal invasion by FL generally involves thebone marrow, skin, and duodenum; splenic infiltration often occurs in theadvanced stages. However, primary splenic FL is very rare. Hence, few studieshave been performed on splenic FL, and its clinicopathological features have not been established. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologicalfeatures of primary splenic FL, as compared to nodal FL. We analyzed 17 patients diagnosed with primary splenic FL and 153 control patients with systemic FL.Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive status was significantly more common in patientswith splenic FL than in the control patients (p¾=¾0.02). Ann Arbor stage III orIV (p¾=¾0.0003) and high-risk FLIPI (Follicular Lymphoma International PrognosticIndex) (p¾=¾0.03) were significantly less common in patients with splenic FL thanin the control patients; however, the overall and progression-free survivalcurves were not significantly different between the groups. Among the 17 patientswith splenic FL, the progression-free survival was significantly worse inpatients who underwent splenectomy without receiving postoperative chemotherapythan in those who did (p¾=¾0.03). These results suggest that primary splenic FLshould be considered different from systemic FL; accordingly, its managementshould also be conducted differently.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir had no effect on the Cmax and AUCtau for rilpivirine and emtricitabine. The Cmax and AUCtau of tenofovir, the major metabolite of TAF, were increased by 62% and 75%,respectively. However, the resulting absolute tenofovir exposures were markedlylower than the historical tenofovir exposures following tenofovir disoproxilfumarate (TDF) and, as such, were not considered to be clinically relevant. Incontrast, additional adverse effect monitoring is recommended uponcoadministration of ledipasvir and TDF due to elevated tenofovir exposuresresulting from the DDI. This difference is explained by the fact that TAF 25¾mgresults in markedly lower (~90%) plasma tenofovir exposure compared to TDF300¾mg. Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and emtricitabine/rilpivirine/TAF were generallywell tolerated when administered alone or in combination.

PHT was determined using peak Tricuspid RegurgitantVelocity (TRV) obtained from echocardiography as a marker. Complete blood count(CBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, reticulocyte count, foetal haemoglobin (HbF) estimation as well as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) I and II,Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) screening were done forpatients with SCA.RESULTS: The mean peak TRV of subjects with SCA and controls was 2.2 ± 0.4 m/sand 1.9 ± 0.3 m/s respectively and prevalence of PHT among children with SCA and controls was 22.9% and 2.3% respectively. PHT in SCA correlated negatively withbody mass index, haematocrit and haemoglobin.CONCLUSION: This study affirms that PHT prevalence is high in children with SCAin Nigeria. Cardiovascular examination for signs of PHT is recommended forchildren with SCA and if required, further echocardiographic assessment from asearly as five years.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Efficacy of Real-world Entecavir Therapy in Treatment-na__ve Chronic Hepatitis B Patients.,/pubmed/28875955,"Background:: Entecavir (ETV) has been shown to be effective in randomizedcontrolled trials in highly selected patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ETV in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in the real-world setting.Methods:: A total of 233 treatment-na´ve, CHB patients who received at least 12months of ETV treatment were included in this retrospective study. Rates ofvirological response (VR), hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) loss, hepatitis B eantigen (HBeAg) clearance/seroconversion, virological breakthrough, cirrhosis,and hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated.Results:: Of 233 patients, 175 patients were male, with mean age of 43 years old,and 135 patients were HBeAg positive. The mean baseline levels of serum alanineaminotransferase and HBV DNA in all patients were 230 U/L and 6.6 log 10 IU/ml,respectively. The mean follow-up period was 28 months. The cumulative rates ofachieving VR increased from 3.4% at 3 months to 94.4% at 60 months. Primarynonresponse occurred in 3 (1.3%) patients. Partial VR (PVR) occurred in 61(26.2%) patients at 12 months. The baseline serum HBV DNA level (hazard ratio[HR], 2.054; P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor for PVR. HBsAg loss didnot occur. The cumulative rates of HBeAg clearance increased from 2.2% at 3months to 28.2% at 60 months. PVR was the significant determinant of HBeAgclearance (HR, 0.341; P = 0.026). Age (HR, 1.072; P = 0.013) and PVR (HR, 5.131; P = 0.017) were the significant determinants of cirrhosis.Conclusions:: ETV treatment was effective for HBV DNA suppression in this study, but HBsAg loss and HBeAg clearance/seroconversion rates were lower compared with previous clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to assess thesafety, tolerability, and anti-fibrotic effect of PRI-724, a small-moleculemodulator of Wnt signaling, in patients with HCV cirrhosis.METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, phase 1 trial, we sequentiallyenrolled patients with HCV cirrhosis who were classified as Child-Pugh (CP) classA or B. PRI-724 was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of 10, 40, or 160mg/m2/day for six cycles of 1week on and 1week off. The primary endpointswere frequency and severity of adverse events. The secondary endpoint wasefficacy of PRI-724 in treating cirrhosis based on CP score and liver biopsy.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no.

High HCV cure rates for people who use drugs treated with direct acting antiviral therapy at an urban primary care clinic.,/pubmed/28811158,"BACKGROUND: Though direct acting antivirals (DAAs) promise high cure rates, many providers and payers remain concerned about successful treatment for people whouse drugs (PWUD), even among those engaged in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Theefficacy of DAAs among PWUD in real-world settings is unclear.METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of patients initiating HCV treatment betweenJanuary 2014 and August 2015 (n=89) at a primary care clinic in the Bronx, NY.Onsite HCV treatment with DAAs was performed by an HCV specialist, with supportfrom a care coordinator funded by the NYC Department of Health. We identifiedfour categories of drug use and drug treatment: (1) no active drug use/notreceiving OAT (defined as non-PWUD); (2) no active drug use/receiving OAT; (3)active drug use/not receiving OAT; and (4) active drug use/receiving OAT. Theprimary outcome was SVR at 12 weeks post-treatment.RESULTS: Overall SVR rates were 95% (n=41/43) for non-PWUD and 96% (n=44/46) for patients actively using drugs and/or receiving OAT [p=0.95]. There were nodifferences in SVR rates by drug use or drug treatment category. Compared tonon-PWUD, those with no active drug use/receiving OAT had 100% SVR (n=15/15;p=1.0), those actively using drugs/not receiving OAT had 90% SVR (n=9/10;p=0.47), and those actively using drugs/receiving OAT had 95% SVR (20/21; p=1.0).CONCLUSION: Regardless of active drug use or OAT, patients who received DAAtherapy at an urban primary care clinic achieved high HCV cure rates.

The patients were treated with 100 mg asunaprevirtwice daily plus 60 mg daclatasvir once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was SVR 24 weeks after completing treatment. In addition, we evaluated theimprovement of liver function and development of HCC for 1 year from the end oftreatment (EOT).RESULTS: The SVR24 rate was 96% (47/49) in the cirrhotic group and 96% (91/95) inthe non-cirrhotic group (p = 0.69). During treatment, grade III/IV adverse eventsoccurred more frequently in cirrhotic patients (10/49; 20.4%) than innon-cirrhotic patients (10/96; 10.4%) (p = 0.099). After EOT, alanineaminotransferase and AFP levels were significantly decreased in cirrhoticpatients with SVR. In addition, serum levels of albumin and platelet counts were significantly increased. On the other hand, the rates of HCC recurrence (43%) anddevelopment (7.4%) were higher in cirrhotic patients than in the non-cirrhoticpatients (12.5% and 1.1%, respectively).CONCLUSION: RAS-oriented asunaprevir/daclatasvir therapy has a strong anti-HCVeffect in patients with HCV genotype 1b.

Application of Exposure-Response Analyses to Establish the Pharmacodynamic Similarity of a Once-Daily Regimen to an Approved Twice-Daily Dosing Regimen for the Treatment of HCV Infection.,/pubmed/28685397,"The triple direct-acting antiviral (3-DAA) regimen (two co-formulated tablets of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir once daily and one tablet of dasabuvir twicedaily) for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection has beenreformulated for once-daily administration containing all three active DAAs (3QD regimen). Two bioequivalence studies compared the 3-DAA and 3QD regimens. Instudy 1, fed, single-, and multiple-dose crossover comparisons revealed exposuresfor drug components that were slightly outside the bioequivalence criteria, i.e.,21 to 29% lower dasabuvir C trough, paritaprevir C max, and ritonavir C max. Instudy 2, fed and fasted single-dose crossover comparisons demonstrated a largeimpact of food on exposures, confirming the product's labeling requirement foradministration only with food, and revealed a lack of bioequivalence underfasting conditions. Exposure-response analyses using efficacy data from phase 2/3studies of the 3-DAA regimen demonstrated that the lower dasabuvir C trough forthe 3QD regimen (under fed condition) would have minimal impact on sustainedvirologic response at week 12 post-treatment (SVR12). Thus, the pharmacodynamicsimilarity between the regimens was established and the analyses provided thebasis for regulatory approval of the 3QD regimen to treat patients with chronicHCV genotype 1 infection.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-four patients with both HCV infection and NHLwere identified between 2000 and 2016 at our institution. We retrospectivelyanalyzed patients' demographic characteristics, treatment, and kinetics of HCVload before and after treatment with rituximab-containing chemotherapy. In thetotal group of 54 patients, 29 (54%) received rituximab.

InItaly, up to 80% of thalassaemia patients bear HCV antibodies due to HCVcontaminated transfusions before 1990. Thalassaemia patients with HCV infectionhave high risk of developing HCC. Treatment based on Pegylated-IFN (Peg-IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) was limited by relevant side effects.AIM: To evaluate the impact of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) fixed dosecombination for 12¾weeks without RBV, in patients with thalassaemia major and HCVGenotype 1 or 4 (GT1/4).METHODS: Open label, historically-controlled, nationwide multicentre study inthalassaemia patients including na´ve with cirrhosis and prior treatment failure without cirrhosis. SOF/LDV single pill was administered for 12¾weeks to 100patients of whom 16% had cirrhosis. The control group included 96 patients withcomparable baseline characteristics treated with Peg-IFN/RBV. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at follow-up week 12 or 24 after IFN-free or Peg-IFN/RBV, respectively.RESULTS: In the study group, sustained virological response (SVR) was reported in98% of patients (95% CI 95.3%-100%).

Effectiveness and safety of first-generation protease inhibitors in real-world patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in Brazil: a multicenter study.,/pubmed/28658438,"OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of first-generation proteaseinhibitors for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus-infected patients atBrazilian reference centers.METHODS:: This multicenter cross-sectional study included hepatitis C virusgenotype 1 monoinfected patients treated with Peg-interferon, ribavirin, andeither boceprevir (n=158) or telaprevir (n=557) between July 2013 and April 2014 at 15 reference centers in Brazil. Demographic, clinical, virological, andadverse events data were collected during treatment and follow-up.RESULTS:: Of the 715 patients, 59% had cirrhosis and 67.1% weretreatment-experienced. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the overallsustained viral response was 56.6%, with similar effectiveness in both groups(51.9% for boceprevir and 58% for telaprevir, p=0.190). Serious adverse eventsoccurred in 44.2% of patients, and six deaths (0.8%) were recorded. Cirrhoticpatients had lower sustained viral response rates than non-cirrhotic patients(46.9% vs. 70.6%, p<0.001) and a higher incidence of serious adverse events(50.7% vs. 34.8%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that sustained viralresponse was associated with the absence of cirrhosis, viral recurrence afterprevious treatment, pretreatment platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3, andachievement of a rapid viral response. Female gender, age>65 years, diagnosis of cirrhosis, and abnormal hemoglobin levels/platelet counts prior to treatment wereassociated with serious adverse events.CONCLUSION:: Although serious adverse events rates were higher in this infectedpopulation, sustained viral response rates were similar to those reported forother patient cohorts.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Evaluation of a hepatitis C education intervention with clients enrolled in methadone maintenance and needle/syringe programs in Malaysia.,/pubmed/28652072,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 40%-90% of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Malaysiahave hepatitis C (HCV). PWID continue to be disproportionately affected by HCVdue to their lack of knowledge, perceived risk and interest in HCV treatment.Education interventions may be an effective strategy for increasing HCV knowledgein PWID, and harm reduction services are uniquely positioned to implement anddeploy such interventions.METHODS: We recruited 176 clients from methadone maintenance treatment (MMT:N=110) and needle/syringe programs (NSP: N=66) between November 2015 and August2016. After baseline knowledge assessments, clients participated in astandardized, 45-min HCV education program and completed post-interventionknowledge assessments to measure change in knowledge and treatment interest.RESULTS: Participants were mostly male (96.3%), Malay (94.9%), and in their early40s (mean=42.6years). Following the intervention, overall knowledge scores andtreatment interest in MMT clients increased by 68% and 16%, respectively(p<0.001). In contrast, NSP clients showed no significant improvement in overall knowledge or treatment interest, and perceived greater treatment barriers.Multivariate linear regression to assess correlates of HCV knowledgepost-intervention revealed that optimal dosage of MMT and having had an HIV test in the past year significantly increased HCV knowledge. Having received ahepatitis B vaccine, however, was not associated with increased HCV knowledgeafter participating in an education session.CONCLUSION: Generally, HCV knowledge and screening is low among clients engagedin MMT and NSP services in Malaysia. Integrating a brief, but comprehensive HCVeducation session within harm reduction services may be a low-cost and effective strategy in improving overall HCV knowledge and risk behaviors inresource-limited settings. In order to be an effective public health approach,however, education interventions must be paired with strategies that improvesocial, economic and political outcomes for PWID. Doing so may reduce HCVdisparities by increasing screening and treatment interest.",Single arm,Y,,,"standardized, 45-min HCV education program",,,,hepatitis C (HCV),measure change in knowledge,
"Response Tailored Protocol Versus the Fixed 12Weeks Course of Dual Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir Treatment in Egyptian Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype-4 Infection: A Randomized, Open-label, Non-inferiority Trial.",/pubmed/28647541,"BACKGROUND: The most recent European Association for the Study of the Liver(EASL) 2016 Guidelines on treatment of hepatitis C (HCV), allowed for shortening the course of treatment for some subsets of patients with sofosbuvir/ledipasvirand with grazoprevir/elbasvir based on cutoff baseline HCV RNA values. Wehypothesized that it would be prudent to also consider an objectively assuringvery rapid, on-treatment, virologic response to therapy at week 2 (vRVR) beforetaking the decision of shortening the treatment duration. So we planned thisstudy to test whether a dual sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) treatment duration tailored according to achieving vRVR to 8 or 12weeks is non-inferior to therecommended fixed 12weeks course in non-cirrhotic Egyptian chronic HCV genotype-4patients.METHODS: The study was conducted in an outpatient setting according to aprospective, randomized, open-label, comparative, non-inferiority study design. Ahundred twenty eligible, non-cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients were randomlyassigned (1:1) to receive daily doses in the form of one Gratisovir 400mg table(generic sofosbuvir produced by Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Alexandria, Egypt) plusone Daktavira 60mg tablet (generic daclatasvir produced by Dawood Pharm, Egypt)for either a fixed 12weeks duration (reference group) or a response tailoredduration (test group). In the test group the treatment duration was tailoredaccording to the virus load tested by real time PCR into 8weeks for patients who had undetectable HCV RNA level in their serum by the end of the second week oftreatment (vRVR)), or 12weeks for those who did not show vRVR. The primaryoutcome of the trial was the proportions of patients achieving SVR12 (HCV RNAbelow lower level of quantification at week 12 after end of treatment). Thecomparison between groups was based on testing the null hypothesis of inferiorityof the response-tailored group with a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority(NI-m) of 0.1 (10%). The protocol was registered with a WHO Clinical TrialRegistration ID: ACTRN12617000263392.https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372041 FINDINGS:Starting from Jun, 5 2016, a hundred twenty eligible patients from 4 outpatientclinics in Alexandria, Egypt were randomized to either a fixed duration group(reference group: n=60 patients) or a response tailored duration group (testgroup: n=60 patients). During the whole period of the study, only 1 patientdropped-out from each group. Both were lost to follow-up after the 4th week'svisit. Baseline characteristics in both groups were almost matching. Fifty eight out of the total 60 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients in the reference groupachieved SVR12 (96.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 88.64-99%). Whereas, 59 outof the total 60 (ITT) patients in the test group achieved SVR12 (98.33% (CI:91.14-99.71%). The per-protocol (PP) analysis, excluding patients who dropped-outbefore collecting their final result, showed that 58/59 (98.31% (CI: 91-99.7%))of patients in the reference group and 59/59 (100% (CI: 93.89-100%) of the testgroup achieved SVR12. Non-inferiority was declared since the upper bound of thetwo-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of SVR12 between groups(P(reference)-P(test)) did not exceed the specified non-inferiority margin of+0.1 (10%), both in ITT population (-1.67%, CI: -9.8%-+5.9%), and in the PPpopulation (-1.69%, CI: -9%-+4.58%). No fatalities or serious adverse events werereported during the period of the study. Similar rates of non-serious adverseevents were reported in both groups with a trend of higher incidence rate in the fixed 12weeks group; all were mild in severity.INTERPRETATION: Shortening the duration of therapy based on observed vRVR couldprovide a prudent basis to avoid unnecessary long treatment courses. This couldnot only reduce the drug exposure and the risk of adverse drug reactions, butalso cut the cost of full treatment course with such expensive medications by onethird. This could economize the treatment budget at the individual out-of-pocket level as well as the public health services and insurance levels and allow forbetter utilization of public health resources.",RCT,,,,"Gratisovir plus Daktavira for a response tailoredduration",Gratisovir plus Daktavira for a fixed 12 weeks duration,,,hepatitis C (HCV),proportions of patients achieving SVR12,
DOT-C: A cluster randomised feasibility trial evaluating directly observed anti-HCV therapy in a population receiving opioid substitute therapy from community pharmacy.,/pubmed/28647161,"BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antiviral therapy (DAAs) for hepatitis C infection(HCV) have a much smaller burden of treatment than interferon-based regimes,require less monitoring and are very effective. New pathways are required toincrease access to treatment amongst people prescribed opioid substitutiontherapy (OST).METHODS: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial with mixed methodsevaluation was undertaken to compare the uptake of dried blood spot testing(DBST) and treatment of people with genotype 1 HCV infection in a conventionalservice pathway versus a pharmacist-led pathway in a population receiving OST.RESULTS: Pharmacies randomised to the conventional pathway obtained 58 DBST from 244 patients (24%):15 new reactive tests and 33 new negative tests wereidentified. Within the pharmacist-led pathway, 94 DBST were obtained from 262patients (36%): 26 new reactive tests and 54 new negative tests were identified. Participants in the pharmacist-led pathway were more likely to take a DBST(p<0.003). Of participants referred for treatment through the conventionalpathway, 4 patients from 15 with new reactive tests (27%) attended clinic forassessment. In the pharmacist-led treatment pathway, 20 patients from 26 with newreactive tests (77%) attended for assessment blood tests. Participants in thepharmacist-led pathway were more likely to proceed through the assessment fortreatment (p<0.002). One participant completed treatment through the conventionalpathway and three patients completed treatment through the pharmacist-ledpathway. The process evaluation identified key themes important to service usercompleters and staff participants.CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that testing and treatment for HCV in apharmacist led-pathway is a feasible treatment pathway for people who receivesupervised OST consumption through community pharmacies. This feasibility trialtherefore provides sufficient confirmation to justify proceeding to a full trial.",RCT,,,, pharmacist-led pathway,conventional service pathway,,,hepatitis C infection,,check outcome
Changes in risk behaviours during and following treatment for hepatitis C virus infection among people who inject drugs: The ACTIVATE study.,/pubmed/28633998,"BACKGROUND: The risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) reinfection due to continuedinjecting risk behaviours might remain a barrier to HCV treatment among peoplewho inject drugs. We aimed to evaluate changes in risk behaviours during andfollowing HCV treatment among people with ongoing injecting drug use or receivingopioid substitution treatment (OST).METHODS: ACTIVATE was an international multicentre clinical trial conductedbetween 2012 and 2014. Participants with HCV genotypes 2/3 infection were treatedwith peg-interferon/ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks and completed aself-administered behavioural questionnaire at each study visit. The impact oftime in treatment and follow-up on longitudinally measured recent (past month)behavioural outcomes was evaluated using generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: Among 93 enrolled participants (83% male, median age 41 years), 55 (59%)had injected in the past month. Any injecting drug use decreased during HCVtreatment and follow-up (OR 0.89 per incremental study visit; 95% CI 0.83-0.95). No significant changes were found in _daily injecting (OR 0.98; 95% CI0.89-1.07), use of non-sterile needles (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79-1.12), sharing ofinjecting paraphernalia (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.70-1.07) or non-injecting drug use (OR1.01; 95% CI 0.92-1.10). Hazardous alcohol use decreased throughout (OR 0.56; 95%CI 0.40-0.77) and OST increased between enrolment and end of treatment (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.07-2.04).CONCLUSIONS: Recent injecting drug use and hazardous alcohol use decreased, whileOST increased during and following HCV treatment among participants with ongoing injecting drug use. These findings support further expansion of HCV care amongPWID.",N,,,,,,,,,,
No Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between the Hepatitis C Virus Inhibitors Elbasvir/Grazoprevir and Famotidine or Pantoprazole.,/pubmed/28625018,"Use of agents to suppress gastric acid secretion is common among patients withhepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aims of this open-label, three-period,fixed-sequence study were to evaluate the effect of famotidine and pantoprazoleon the pharmacokinetics and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination(FDC) in 16 healthy subjects. Elbasvir and grazoprevir each exhibited similarpharmacokinetics following single-dose administration of elbasvir/grazoprevirwith or without famotidine or pantoprazole. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) ofgrazoprevir AUC(0,Á), Cmax , and C24 (elbasvir/grazoprevir + famotidine orelbasvir/grazoprevir + pantoprazole vs. elbasvir/grazoprevir) ranged from0.89-1.17.

Efficacy of response-guided directly observed pegylated interferon and self-administered ribavirin for people who inject drugs with hepatitis C virus genotype 2/3 infection: The ACTIVATE study.,/pubmed/28624134,"BACKGROUND: There are few data on treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectionamong people with ongoing injecting drug use. This study evaluated the efficacyof response-guided therapy for chronic HCV genotypes 2/3 infection among peoplewith ongoing injecting drug use or receiving opioid substitution therapy (OST). Asecondary aim was to identify predictors of HCV treatment response.METHODS: ACTIVATE was a multicentre clinical trial recruited between 2012 and2014. Participants with genotypes 2/3 were treated with directly observedpeg-interferon alfa-2b and self-administered ribavirin for 12 (undetectable HCVRNA at week 4) or 24 weeks (detectable HCV RNA at week 4). Participants wererecruited from drug treatment clinics, private practices, hospital clinics andcommunity clinics in Australia, Canada, and five countries in Europe. The primarystudy outcome was sustained virological response (SVR, undetectable HCV RNA >12weeks post-treatment).RESULTS: Among 93 people with ongoing injecting drug use or receiving OST treatedfor HCV genotype 2/3, 59% had recently (past month) injected drugs, 77% werereceiving OST and 56% injected drugs during therapy. Overall SVR was 66% (61/93).SVR was 84% in those with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 (12 weeks) compared to38% in those without (24 weeks). In adjusted analysis, cirrhosis vs. no/mildfibrosis [adjusted OR (aOR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.13, 0.86] predicted reduced SVR, whileresponse at week 4 was associated with increased SVR [aOR 8.11, 95% CI 2.73,24.10]. Recent injecting drug use at baseline or during therapy was notassociated with SVR.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that people with recent injecting drug use orOST with chronic HCV can achieve responses to interferon-based therapy similar toother populations, despite injecting drugs prior to or during therapy.

Dynamics of liver stiffness values by means of transient elastography in patients with HCV liver cirrhosis undergoing interferon free treatment.,/pubmed/28617884,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver stiffness (LS) measurement by Transient Elastography(TE) has been widely accepted as a tool for fibrosis assessment. The aim of this study was to assess LS dynamics in a group of patients with HCV liver cirrhosisafter interferon free treatment (IFT).METHODS: This two-center clinical trial included 225 patients with compensatedHCV cirrhosis (all genotype 1b), who received IFT for 12 weeks. All patients wereevaluated by means of TE at the beginning and at the end of treatment (EOT), and a subgroup (170 patients) also 12 weeks after EOT; all of them had sustainedviral response (SVR). Reliable LS measurements (LSM) were defined as a medianvalue of 10 valid LSM, with IQR <30% and SR >/=60%. Both M and XL probes wereused. For diagnosing cirrhosis we used a cut-off value of 12kPa as proposed bythe Tsochatzis meta-analysis. We considered a decrease or increase of more than10% in LSM as being significant.RESULTS: Out of 225 subjects, reliable measurements were obtained in 93.7%, sothat the final analysis included 211 patients. The mean LS values decreasedsignificantly after IFT: 26.4+/-11.7 vs. 23.5+/-13.3 kPa (p=0.01). Most patients,59.2% (125/211) presented more than 10% decrease in LS values, 24.1% (51/211) hadstable LS values, while in 16.4% (35/211) cases, the LS values increased. In the subgroup of 170 patients with LSM also performed 12 weeks after EOT (SVR), themean LS values were significantly lower as compared to baseline: 21.3+/-11 kPavs. 27.4+/-11.9 kPa (p<0.0001) and also as compared to EOT: 21.3+/-11 kPa vs.23.7+/-13.3 kPa (p<0.0001).CONCLUSION: In our patients with HCV liver cirrhosis, the mean LS valuesevaluated by TE significantly decreased after antiviral treatment at EOT and also12 weeks after EOT as compared to baseline. Overall, about 60% of patients had LSvalues at EOT lower than at baseline, while 12 weeks after EOT about 75% ofpatients had LS values lower than at baseline.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Stroke in HIV-infected individuals with and without HCV coinfection in Spain in the combination antiretroviral therapy era.,/pubmed/28617855,"The incidence of stroke in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infectedindividuals has been well analyzed in recent epidemiological studies. However,little is known about the specific contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV)infection to stroke among HIV-infected individuals. The aims of this study wereto analyze trends in the incidence rates of stroke in HIV-infected individualsduring the combination antiretroviral (cART) era in Spain and to categorize them by the presence or absence of HCV coinfection. We analyzed hospital dischargeswith a diagnosis of stroke in Spain according to ICD-9-CM during 1997-2013. Thestudy period was divided into four calendar periods (1997-1999, 2000-2003,2004-2007, and 2008-2013). Patients were classified according to HCV serology.The number of HIV-infected patients was estimated based on data from the NationalCentre of Epidemiology. We calculated incidence rates (events per 10,000patient-years) and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFR). The incidence ofhemorrhagic stroke (HS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (15.8 [1997-1999] to 6.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.3[1997-1999] to 5.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The incidence of ischemic stroke (IS)decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (27.4 [1997-1999] to 21.7 [2008-2013]; P =0.005) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.8 [1997-1999] to 11.9[2008-2013]; P<0.001). The CFR was 3.3 times higher for HS than for IS for thewhole study period. The CFR of HS in HIV-monoinfected patients decreasedsignificantly (47.4% [1997-1999] to 30.6% [2008-2013]; P = 0.010) but did notchange significantly among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (41.4% [1997-1999] to44.7% [2008-2013]; P = 0.784). The CFR of IS in the whole HIV-infected populationdecreased significantly (14.6% [1997-1999] to 10.9% [2008-2013]; P = 0.034),although no significant differences were found when each group was analyzedseparately. In conclusion, after the introduction of cART, HS and IS ratesdecreased in HIV-monoinfected individuals, but increased steadily inHIV/HCV-coinfected individuals.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Participants with genotypes 2/3 were treated with directly observedpeg-interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) and self-administered ribavirin for 12(undetectable HCV RNA at week 4) or 24¾weeks (detectable HCV RNA at week 4).Outcomes included treatment completion, PEG-IFN adherence, ribavirin adherence,and sustained virological response (SVR, undetectable HCV RNA >12¾weekspost-treatment).RESULTS: Among 93 people treated, 59% had recently injected drugs (past month),77% were receiving OST and 56% injected drugs during therapy. Overall, 76%completed treatment. Mean on-treatment adherence to PEG-IFN and ribavirin were98.2% and 94.6%. Overall, 6% of participants missed >1 dose of PEG-IFN and 31%took <95% of their prescribed ribavirin., Higher treatment completion wasobserved among those receiving 12 vs. 24¾weeks of treatment (97% vs. 46%,P¾<¾0.001) while the proportion of participants with 95% on-treatment ribavirinadherence was similar between groups (67% vs. 72%, P¾=¾0.664). Receiving 12¾weeksof therapy was independently associated with treatment completion. No factorswere associated with 95% RBV adherence. Neither recent injecting drug use atbaseline nor during therapy was associated with treatment completion or adherenceto ribavirin. In adjusted analysis, treatment completion was associated with SVR (aOR 23.9, 95% CI 2.9-193.8).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high adherence to directly observedPEG-IFN and self-administered ribavirin among people with ongoing injecting drug use or receiving OST. These data also suggest that shortening therapy from 24 to 12¾weeks can lead to improved treatment completion. Treatment completion wasassociated with improved response to therapy.

"Sofosbuvir, Velpatasvir, and Voxilaprevir for Previously Treated HCV Infection.",/pubmed/28564569,"BACKGROUND: Patients who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)and who do not have a sustained virologic response after treatment with regimens containing direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have limited retreatmentoptions.METHODS: We conducted two phase 3 trials involving patients who had beenpreviously treated with a DAA-containing regimen. In POLARIS-1, patients with HCVgenotype 1 infection who had previously received a regimen containing an NS5Ainhibitor were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir, and the proteaseinhibitor voxilaprevir (150 patients) or matching placebo (150 patients) oncedaily for 12 weeks. Patients who were infected with HCV of other genotypes (114patients) were enrolled in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir group. InPOLARIS-4, patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 infection who had previouslyreceived a DAA regimen but not an NS5A inhibitor were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir (163 patients) orsofosbuvir-velpatasvir (151 patients) for 12 weeks. An additional 19 patientswith HCV genotype 4 infection were enrolled in thesofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir group.RESULTS: In the three active-treatment groups, 46% of the patients hadcompensated cirrhosis.

Impact of terlipressin infusion during and after live donor liver transplantation on incidence of acute kidney injury and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin serum levels: A randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28564127,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute kidney injury (AKI) with liver transplantation (LT) is not uncommon. Impact of terlipressin infusion on AKI, hemodynamics, and plasmaconcentration of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was studied.METHODS: Patients (n=50) were randomized (NCT02059460, USA) into two equalgroups: terlipressin vs Controls. Terlipressin (1-4¾_g/kg/h) was administratedfor 5¾days. Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler for hemodynamic management.Renal functions, peak portal vein blood flow velocity (PPV), and hepatic arteryresistive index (HARI) were recorded. Plasma NGAL (pNGAL) was measured baseline, 2 and 24¾hours postreperfusion.RESULTS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was the main etiology. Age, sex, model ofend-stage liver disease (MELD), and renal functions were comparable.Postoperative AKI incidence and NGAL concentrations were comparable (P>.05)between terlipressin and controls groups (44% vs 48% and 112.5±9 vs93.1±8¾ng/mL), respectively, but intraoperative NGAL in both groups increasedsignificantly 2¾hours postreperfusion (P<.05). The three NGAL readings werecomparable (P>.05) between AKI (n=23) and non-AKI developers (n=27). Meanarterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained in both groups with less systemicvascular resistance (SVR) fluctuations with terlipressin. Median norepinephrineconsumption was lower in terlipressin vs controls (8 vs 12¾mg; P=.04).

Improvement of ALT decay kinetics by all-oral HCV treatment: Role of NS5A inhibitors and differences with IFN-based regimens.,/pubmed/28545127,"BACKGROUND: Intracellular HCV-RNA reduction is a proposed mechanism of action of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), alternative to hepatocytes elimination bypegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (PR). We modeled ALT and HCV-RNA kinetics in cirrhotic patients treated with currently-used all-DAA combinations to evaluatetheir mode of action and cytotoxicity compared with telaprevir (TVR)+PR.STUDY DESIGN: Mathematical modeling of ALT and HCV-RNA kinetics was performed in 111 HCV-1 cirrhotic patients, 81 treated with all-DAA regimens and 30 withTVR+PR. Kinetic-models and Cox-analysis were used to assess determinants ofALT-decay and normalization.RESULTS: HCV-RNA kinetics was biphasic, reflecting a mean effectiveness inblocking viral production >99.8%. The first-phase of viral-decline was faster in patients receiving NS5A-inhibitors compared to TVR+PR or sofosbuvir+simeprevir(p<0.001), reflecting higher efficacy in blocking assembly/secretion. Thesecond-phase, noted _ and attributed to infected-cell loss, was faster inpatients receiving TVR+PR or sofosbuvir+simeprevir compared to NS5A-inhibitors(0.27 vs 0.21 d-1, respectively, p = 0.0012). In contrast the rate ofALT-normalization, noted _, was slower in patients receiving TVR+PR orsofosbuvir+simeprevir compared to NS5A-inhibitors (0.17 vs 0.27 d-1,respectively, p<0.001). There was no significant association between thesecond-phase of viral-decline and ALT normalization rate and, for a given levelof viral reduction, ALT-normalization was more profound in patients receivingDAA, and NS5A in particular, than TVR+PR.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a process of HCV-clearance by all-DAA regimenspotentiated by NS5A-inhibitor, and less relying upon hepatocyte death thanIFN-containing regimens. This may underline a process of ""cell-cure"" by DAAs,leading to a fast improvement of liver homeostasis.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 2-Infected Japanese Patients.,/pubmed/28536999,"INTRODUCTION: In Japan, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 2 accounts forapproximately 32% of HCV infections. Limited treatment options exist in Japan forHCV GT2-infected patients. GIFT-II was a phase¾3, randomized, open-label studyevaluating the efficacy and safety of 16- and 12-week regimens of co-formulatedombitasvir (OBV)/paritaprevir (PTV)/ritonavir (r) plus ribavirin (RBV) inJapanese adults with HCV GT2 infection.METHODS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to once-daily, co-formulatedOBV/PTV/r (25/150/100¾mg) with weight-based RBV for 16 or 12¾weeks. The primaryefficacy endpoint was the sustained virologic response at 12¾weeks post-treatment(SVR12) rate in the primary efficacy population of non-cirrhotic treatment-naive patients.RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were randomized to OBV/PTV/r¾+¾RBV. In theprimary efficacy population, SVR12 rates were 91.5% (43/47; 95% confidenceinterval 83.5-99.5%) and 75.0% (36/48; 95% confidence interval 62.8-87.2%) in the16-week arm and 12-week arm, respectively. No patient in the 16-week arm relapsedby post-treatment week¾12. Among non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients,the overall SVR rate in the 16-week arm was 75.8% (25/33) and was highest [93.8% (15/16)] among those who had relapsed after previous interferon-based therapy.SVR12 rates were consistently higher in patients with HCV GT2a infection versusHCV GT2b infection [16-week treatment arm: 93.9% (31/33) versus 85.7% (12/14) and93.8% (15/16) versus 56.3% (9/16) among non-cirrhotic treatment-naive andtreatment-experienced patients, respectively].

Contrasting HCV and HIV seroepidemiology in 11 years of blood donors screening in Brazil.,/pubmed/28524366,"BACKGROUND: Blood donors are, in principle, healthy individuals who may berevealed as infectious for blood-borne agents by the laboratory screeningprocess, depicting the asymptomatic burden of the disease. Therefore, monitoring hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected donor and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)-infected donor and associating to their demographical and behaviouralcharacteristics may shed light on the dynamics and contemporary changes in these viruses' epidemiology.METHODS: Donors presenting repeatedly reactive HCV or HIV serology/nucleic acidtesting (NAT) screening results were submitted to confirmatory testing. Confirmedpositive donors were invited to return to the blood bank for notification andcounselling when a follow-up sample was obtained and an interview performed toeventually disclose potential risks. HCV- or HIV-infected donors identified over 11 years of screening (2004-2015) were evaluated for demographic and behavioural parameters.RESULTS: In the period, 139 160 donations were screened, and 36 (0.025%) werefound positive for HIV, stemming from 29 male and 7 female donors. Among those,eight subjects were repeat donors. A total of 95 donations were found repeatedly reactive for HCV (0.068%), obtained from 60 men and 35 women. Noticeably, indespite of a higher HCV prevalence in the donor population, the incidence of HIV among repeat donors was 10 times that of HCV (18 _ 1.6/100 000 persons-year,respectively). On average, HIV-seroreactive men were found to be younger (mean = 34 years old) than women (mean = 40 years old). A total of 10 donors acknowledgedsexual behaviours not previously informed, including 2 who were aware of theirHIV-positive status and another 2 who admitted to be seeking HIV testing. Nowindow period donation was verified.DISCUSSION: The majority of the HIV-infected donors are young males who deny riskfactors in the interview and also ignore the confidence self-exclusionopportunity. As they may reiterate this behaviour in serial donations, use of themost sensitive laboratory testing is justified in this setting.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Effect of Steady-State Faldaprevir on Pharmacokinetics of Atorvastatin or Rosuvastatin in Healthy Volunteers: A Prospective Open-Label, Fixed-Sequence Crossover Study.",/pubmed/28513969,"Faldaprevir (FDV) is a potent, orally administered inhibitor of hepatitis C virusprotease. It inhibits multiple cytochrome P-450 enzymes and multiple membranetransporters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect ofsteady-state faldaprevir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose ofatorvastatin or rosuvastatin. In this single-center, open-label, fixed-sequencecrossover study, 33 healthy adult male and female volunteers were given eitheratorvastatin 10¾mg (n = 16) or rosuvastatin 10¾mg (n = 17) on day 1. Subjectssubsequently received 240¾mg twice daily of faldaprevir (loading dose) on day 5, followed by 240¾mg faldaprevir once daily from day 6 to day 10, with anadditional single dose of atorvastatin (10¾mg) or rosuvastatin (10¾mg) given onday 10. PK samples for the statins were collected on days 1-3 and days 10-12.Concomitant administration with faldaprevir led to approximately 9-fold and34-fold increases in AUC0-Á and Cmax , respectively, of atorvastatin andapproximately 15-fold and 33-fold increases in AUC0-Á and Cmax , respectively, ofrosuvastatin, compared with the statins given alone. Exposure to the majormetabolites (ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin and N-desmethylrosuvastatin) was increasedto a similar magnitude as that of the parent compounds. The marked drug-druginteraction observed is most likely related to the inhibitory effects offaldaprevir on transporters, particularly hepatic uptake transporters such asOTAP1B1 and OATP1B3. Given the significant increase in exposure to statins inhealthy volunteers, coadministration of faldaprevir with statins should beavoided.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reversion of anergy signatures in clonal CD21(low) B cells of mixed cryoglobulinemia after clearance of HCV viremia.,/pubmed/28507081,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) by driving clonalexpansion of IgM+CD27+ B cells. These cells display both the features of anergyinduced by continual engagement of the B-cell receptor (BCR), such as highexpression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) andreduced lifespan, and of virus-specific exhaustion, such as CD21low phenotype anda defective response to ligation of BCR and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). MCusually regresses after eradication of HCV with interferon, whoseimmunomodulatory activity might contribute to this effect. We investigated thephenotypic and functional changes in clonal B cells of MC patients with sustainedvirologic responses to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which lackimmunomodulatory properties. We found that high pERK expression and acceleratedapoptosis revert within 4 weeks after beginning therapy, whereas clonal B cellsunresponsive to TLR9 stimulation persist for at least 24 weeks, although they maypartially rescue normal CD21 expression. Thus, similar to mouse models, features of anergy in MC B cells rapidly revert after disengagement from HCV, whereasvirus-specific exhaustion imparts a durable inhibitory imprint on cell function. Treatment of HCV+ MC with DAAs provides a valuable tool for untangling themolecular mechanisms of anergy and exhaustion in human B cells.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic Resonance Elastography Shear Wave Velocity Correlates with Liver Fibrosis and Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient in Adults with Advanced Liver Disease.,/pubmed/28480218,"Background. Portal hypertension, an elevation in the hepatic venous pressuregradient (HVPG), can be used to monitor disease progression and response totherapy in cirrhosis. Since obtaining HVPG measurements is invasive, reliablenoninvasive methods of assessing portal hypertension are needed. Methods.Noninvasive markers of fibrosis, including magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) shear wave velocity, were correlated with histologic fibrosis and HVPGmeasurements in hepatitis C (HCV) and/or HIV-infected patients with advancedliver disease enrolled in a clinical trial of treatment with simtuzumab, ananti-LOXL2 antibody. Results. This exploratory analysis includes 23 subjects: 9with HCV monoinfection, 9 with HIV and HCV, and 5 with HIV and nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis. Median Ishak fibrosis score was 4 (range 1-6); 11 subjects (48%)had cirrhosis. Median HVPG was 6_mmHg (range 3-16). Liver stiffness measured byMRE correlated with HVPG (r = 0.64, p = 0.01), histologic fibrosis score (r =0.71, p = 0.004), noninvasive fibrosis indices, including APRI (r = 0.81, p <0.001), and soluble LOXL2 (r = 0.82, p = 0.001). On stepwise multivariateregression analysis, MRE was the only variable independently associated with HVPG(R2 = 0.377, p = 0.02). Conclusions. MRE of the liver correlated independentlywith HVPG. MRE is a valid noninvasive measure of liver disease severity and mayprove to be a useful tool for noninvasive portal hypertension assessment. TrialRegistration Number.

These efforts led to thediscovery of BMS-929075 (37), which maintained ligand efficiency relative toearly leads, demonstrated efficacy in a triple combination regimen in HCVreplicon cells, and exhibited consistently high oral bioavailability andpharmacokinetic parameters across preclinical animal species. The human PKproperties from the Phase I clinical studies of 37 were better than anticipatedand suggest promising potential for QD administration.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Changed Proportion of CD45RA(+)/CD45RO(+) T Cells in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients During Pegylated Interferon-± with Ribavirin Therapy.,/pubmed/28414566,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) may progress toward chronic hepatitis,liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. A therapy for patients with chronic HCVinfection is the combination of pegylated interferon-_ with ribavirin, whichincreases the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) to 56%. However, apractical biomarker to predict SVR is lacking. T cells expressing the CD45RAisoform are considered naive, and antigenic stimulation converts them to CD45RO+.CD45RO+ T cells exhibit immediate response and high lymphokine production,leading to the maintenance and upregulation of immune reactions. The aim of this study is to clarify the proportions of CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells associatedwith rapid virological response and SVR. We collected blood samples from 32 HCVpatients receiving the combined treatment. The samples were collected before,during 4th, 12th, and 24th therapy weeks, and 4th week posttherapy, and their Tcell populations were analyzed using flow cytometry. Twenty-nine patients (90.6%)achieved SVR. There were significant declines in proportions of CD45RA+ cellsduring 4th, 12th, and 24th therapy weeks, and significant increases inproportions of CD45RO+ cells during 24th therapy week and 4th week posttherapy(P_<_0.05). Patients undergoing hepatitis C therapy exhibited lowered CD45RA+cell proportions and increased CD45RO+ cell proportions. This effect may beimportant in a patient's response to pegylated interferon-_ with ribavirintherapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Efficacy of Sofosbuvir Plus Ribavirin with or Without Peginterferon- Alfa in Treatment of a Cohort of Egyptian Patients with Hepatitis C Virus Infection.,/pubmed/28413993,"Background &amp; Aims: Sofosbuvir is a powerful drug for the treatment ofhepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In comparison to preceding remedies,sofosbuvirbased regimens provide a higher cure rate, fewer side effects, and muchlower duration of treatment. The aim of the work was to assess the efficacy andsafety of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without peginterferon-alfa in thetreatment of a cohort of Egyptian patients with hepatitis C virusinfection.METHODS: Two hundred treatment naive patients who were HCV-antibodypositive and HCV RNA by PCR positive aged more than 18 years were enrolled in thestudy and patients were classified into two groups: Group I which included 100patients who received dual therapy with sofosbuvir plus oral weight basedribavirin for 24 weeks and Group II which included 100 patients on triple therapywith sofosbuvir plus oral weight based ribavirin (as with the dual therapy) and a180 mcg Peg-INF alpha 2a subcutaneous injection weekly for 12 weeks.

The efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatments with glecaprevir (ABT-493; NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530; NS5A inhibitor)were evaluated in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection.METHODS: SURVEYOR-I and SURVEYOR-II were phase II, open-label, multicenter,dose-ranging trials including patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infectionwho were either previously untreated or treated with pegylated interferon plusribavirin. Patients received once-daily glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir at varying doses with or without ribavirin for 8 or 12weeks. The primary efficacy endpointwas the percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response atpost-treatment week 12 (SVR12).RESULTS: Of the 449 patients who received varying doses of glecaprevir pluspibrentasvir, 25%, 29%, 39%, and 8% had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4-6 infection, respectively. Twelve-week treatment achieved SVR12 in 97-100%, 96-100%, 83-94%,and 100% in genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4-6, respectively. Eight-week treatment with300mg glecaprevir plus 120mg pibrentasvir in genotype 1-, 2-, or 3-infectedpatients yielded 97-98% SVR12 with no virologic failures.

"Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection in Egyptian patients with or without compensated cirrhosis (AGATE-II): a multicentre, phase 3, partly randomised open-label trial.",/pubmed/28404110,"BACKGROUND: In Egypt, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection occurs in around 10% of the population (about 8 million individuals), and is a leading cause ofliver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality. Although HCV genotype 4constitutes about 20% of HCV infections worldwide, the prevalence in Egypt ismore than 90%. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the two direct-actingantiviral drugs ombitasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, and paritaprevir, an NS3/4Aprotease inhibitor dosed with ritonavir, plus ribavirin in treatment of chronicHCV infection in Egypt.METHODS: AGATE-II was a phase 3, open-label, partly randomised trial in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection recruited from five academic and hepatologycentres in Egypt. Patients were HCV treatment-naive or treatment-experienced withinterferon-based regimens. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and hadbeen chronically infected with HCV genotype 4 for at least 6 months with a plasmaHCV RNA concentration of more than 1000 IU/mL at screening. Patients withoutcirrhosis were assigned to receive 12 weeks of 25 mg ombitasvir, 150 mgparitaprevir, and 100 mg ritonavir orally once daily plus weight-based ribavirin.Patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive thesame treatment for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified byprevious pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment experience using aweb-based interactive response technology system and computer-generated schedulesprepared by personnel from the funder's statistics department. Investigators weremasked to randomisation schedules and were informed of each patient's assignedtreatment by the interactive response technology system immediately afterallocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a sustained virological response (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the last dose of studydrug (SVR12). All patients who received at least one dose of study drugs wereincluded in the primary and safety analysis. This study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02247401.FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2014, and March 16, 2015, we screened 182 patients with HCV infection, of whom 160 were eligible for inclusion; 100 patients wereassessed as not having cirrhosis and were given 12 weeks of treatment, and 60patients assessed as having cirrhosis were randomly assigned to the 12-weektreatment group (n=31) or the 24-week treatment group (n=29). 94 (94%; 95% CI88-97) of 100 patients in the without cirrhosis group, 30 (97%; 84-99) of 31patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatment group, and 27 (93%; 78-98) of 29patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group achieved SVR12. The most commonadverse events in patients without cirrhosis were headache (41 [41%]) and fatigue(35 [35%]). Fatigue occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-weektreatment group and 11 (38%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group,and headache occurred in nine (29%) patients in the cirrhosis 12-week treatmentgroup and in 10 (35%) patients in the cirrhosis 24-week treatment group. Adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity, and laboratoryabnormalities were not clinically meaningful. No patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. One serious adverse event in the group withoutcirrhosis was attributed to study drugs by the investigators; the patient haddeep venous thrombosis.INTERPRETATION: Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for 12weeks achieved SVR12 in a high proportion of patients and was well tolerated inEgyptian patients with HCV genotype 4 infection with or without compensatedcirrhosis. Extension of treatment to 24 weeks in patients with cirrhosis did not improve the proportion of patients achieving SVR12.

"Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin in adults with hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection and cirrhosis (AGATE-I): a multicentre, phase 3, randomised open-label trial.",/pubmed/28404108,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 infection is most commonlyreported in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East; however, prevalence isincreasing worldwide through immigration. HCV genotype 4 accounts for 20% of all infections, but clinical trial data for treatment remain limited. We assessed thecombination of two direct-acting antivirals, ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor) andparitaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor; co-dosed with ritonavir) plus ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and compensated cirrhosis.METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 trial (AGATE-I),treatment-naive and interferon or pegylated interferon and ribavirintreatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and compensatedcirrhosis were recruited from academic, public, and private hospitals in Austria,Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the USA. Key eligibilitycriteria were age 18 years or older, with chronic HCV infection assessed by thepresence of anti-HCV antibodies or HCV RNA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1)to receive 25 mg ombitasvir, 150 mg paritaprevir, and 100 mg ritonavir oncedaily, with weight-based ribavirin dosed twice daily for either 12 weeks or 16weeks. Randomisation was stratified by HCV treatment history(treatment-experienced vs treatment-naive patients) and further stratified bytype of non-response to previous HCV treatment (null responders, partialresponders, or relapsers) for treatment-experienced patients. Treatments wereassigned by an interactive response technology system with computer-generatedrandomisation lists prepared by personnel from the study's funding sponsor whowere not involved with the conduct of the study or with data analysis. Theprimary outcome was the proportion of patients with a sustained virologicalresponse (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL) at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) in theintention-to-treat population, with the lower 97à5% CI compared with a clinicallyrelevant threshold (67%; based on SVR reported for pegylated interferon andribavirin) to achieve superiority. The safety population included all patientswho received at least one dose of study drug, and safety analyses were done bythe treatment duration received (12 weeks or 16 weeks). Data presented are fromthe planned primary interim analysis of part one of the study when all patientsenrolled in part one had reached post-treatment week 12 or prematurelydiscontinued from the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,number NCT02265237, and part two of the trial is ongoing but closed to newparticipants.FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2014, and May 19, 2015, we enrolled 120 eligiblepatients, with 59 patients assigned to receive 12 weeks of treatment and 61patients assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir,and ritonavir plus ribavirin. One patient in the 12-week group experiencedvirological breakthrough and one discontinued prematurely after the first day of treatment. One patient missed the post-treatment week 12 visit in the 16-weekgroup. SVR12 was achieved in 57 (97%; 97à5% CI 86à7-99à2) of 59 patients in the12-week group and 60 (98%; 89à6-99à8) of 61 in the 16-week group. Adverse events in more than 10% of all patients were asthenia (11 [18%] of 60 in the 12-weekgroup; 19 [32%] of 60 in the 16-week group), fatigue (ten [17%] in the 12-weekgroup; 20 [33%] in the 16-week group), headache (14 [23%] in the 12-week group;14 [23%] in the 16-week group), anaemia (nine [15%] in the 12-week group; 12[20%] in the 16-week group), pruritus (five [8%] in the 12-week group; 14 [23%]in the 16-week group), nausea (six [10%] in the 12-week group; eight [13%] in the16-week group), and dizziness (four [7%] in the 12-week group; nine [15%] in the 16-week group).INTERPRETATION: With SVR12 achieved in a high proportion of patients, nopost-treatment relapses, and a similar adverse event profile for the 12-week and 16-week treatment groups, extending treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin beyond 12 weeks seems to have no additional benefit for patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and compensated cirrhosis and might not benecessary for this patient group.FUNDING: AbbVie.",RCT,,,,"ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir with weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks","ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir with weight-based ribavirin for 16 weeks",,,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4,sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment,

Eligiblepatients were aged 18 years or older with any HCV genotype and decompensatedcirrhosis at screening. PROs were collected for the intention-to-treat populationusing four questionnaires, Short Form (36) Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2), theFunctional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), the ChronicLiver Disease Questionnaire-HCV Version (CLDQ-HCV), and the Work ProductivityActivity Index:HCV (WPAI), which were given prospectively to patients before,during, and after treatment. The ASTRAL-4 study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02201901.FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled at 47 hepatology outpatient practices in the USAfrom Aug 19, 2014, to Dec 19, 2014. 267 patients with HCV-related decompensatedcirrhosis were included. In patients given sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12weeks (n=90), clinically significant improvements in PROs started 4 weeks aftertreatment initiation (+4à4 to +7à5 points on a 0-100 scale at treatment week 4). By the end of treatment, mean improvements in PROs of +5à3 to +16à0 points werenoted in all PROs except for role emotional, mental component summary, and socialwellbeing scores and work productivity metrics by WPAI:HCV. Similarend-of-treatment improvements (+3à8 to +17à0 points) were observed in patientsgiven sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 24 weeks (n=90). In patients givensofosbuvir and velpatasvir plus ribavirin (n=87), PRO scores decreased within 4weeks of treatment (-3à6 to -6à9 points), although scores returned to thebaseline levels by the end of treatment. After treatment cessation, significantimprovements in all PROs were similar between the treatment groups (all p>0à01)and, by post-treatment week 24, improvements were between +4à9 and +21à2 points. In multivariate analysis, predictors of PRO impairment were treatment naivety,anxiety, use of anxiolytics, use of antidepressants, use of opioids, ribavirinuse, the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, insomnia, and depression.INTERPRETATION: A clinically significant early (within 4 weeks) and sustainedimprovement in PROs was observed in patients with HCV-related decompensatedcirrhosis who were given sofosbuvir and velpatasvir without ribavirin. A similar regimen with ribavirin resulted in a temporary decrease in PROs, which completelyresolved after 8 weeks of treatment.

We assessed the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir andvelpatasvir plus the pangenotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitor voxilaprevir(sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir).METHODS: In 2 phase 3, open-label trials, patients with HCV infection who had notbeen treated previously with a direct-acting antiviral agent were assignedrandomly to groups given sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir for 8 weeks orsofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2, which enrolled patients infected with all HCV genotypes with or without cirrhosis, except patients with genotype 3and cirrhosis, was designed to test the noninferiority of 8 weeks ofsofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir using anoninferiority margin of 5%. POLARIS-3, which enrolled patients infected with HCVgenotype 3 who had cirrhosis, compared rates of SVR in both groups with aperformance goal of 83%.RESULTS: In POLARIS-2, 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93%-97%) of patientshad an SVR to 8 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir; this did not meetthe criterion to establish noninferiority to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, which produced an SVR in 98% of patients (95% CI, 96%-99%; difference in thestratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel proportions of -3.2%; 95% CI, -6.0% to -0.4%).The difference in the efficacy was owing primarily to a lower rate of SVR (92%)among patients with HCV genotype 1a infection receiving 8 weeks ofsofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir. In POLARIS-3, 96% of patients (95% CI,91%-99%) achieved an SVR in both treatment groups, which was significantlysuperior to the performance goal. Overall, the most common adverse events wereheadache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea; diarrhea and nausea were reported morefrequently by patients receiving voxilaprevir. In both trials, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was low (range,0%-1%).CONCLUSIONS: In phase 3 trials of patients with HCV infection, we did notestablish that sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir for 8 weeks was noninferior tosofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks, but the 2 regimens had similar rates of SVR in patients with HCV genotype 3 and cirrhosis.

"Correction of vitamin D deficiency facilitated suppression of IP-10 and DPP IV levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C: A randomised double-blinded, placebo-control trial.",/pubmed/28376103,"Vitamin D deficiency was common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) andhad negative influence on treatment outcome. Correction of vitamin D deficiencyimproved treatment response. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) andenzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) involved in inflammatory responses in CHC.Their higher levels at pretreatment of CHC could predict poorer responses.Vitamin D suppressed expression of IP-10 from monocytes in vitro. In CHCpatients, DPP IV involved in IP-10 regulation. We hypothesized that correction ofvitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in CHC patients might restore immunedysregulation through a pathway linked to the TH1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 or DPP IV.We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 80 CHC patients withvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were assigned to receive vitamin D (40) orplacebo (40) supplements for 6 weeks. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D], Th1/Th2 cytokines, IP-10 and DPP IV were measured at baseline and atthe 6th week. At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised. There were no changes in the level ofTh1/Th2 cytokines.

"HCV core antigen as an alternate test to HCV RNA for assessment of virologic responses to all-oral, interferon-free treatment in HCV genotype 1 infected patients.",/pubmed/28359920,"In light of the advances in HCV therapy, simplification of diagnosisconfirmation, pre- treatment diagnostic workup and treatment monitoring isrequired to ensure broad access to interferon-free therapies. HCV core antigen(HCV cAg) testing is rapid, giving results in approximately 60min, and lessexpensive than HCV RNA methods. While extensive data on the analyticalperformance of HCV cAg relative to RNA or comparisons in longitudinal studies of patients on interferon based (response guided) therapy there is very limited dataon the relative performance of HCV cAg in diagnosis and monitoring patientsreceiving all-oral interferon free regimens. Furthermore, there is no data in theliterature that describes the specificity of HCV cAg in patients with resolvedHCV infection i.e. anti-HCV positive/HCV RNA negative.

Sofosbuvir Plus Ribavirin Without Interferon for Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Virus Infection in HIV-1-Infected Individuals: SWIFT-C.,/pubmed/28329053,"Background: Historically, acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was treatedwith shorter durations of interferon-containing therapies. In the era ofdirect-acting antivirals (DAAs), it is unclear whether the efficacy of treatment achieved in chronic infection can be maintained with abbreviated courses oftherapy during the acute phase.Methods: The sofosbuvir-containing regimens without interferon for treatment ofacute HCV in HIV-1 infected individuals (SWIFT-C) is an open-label, 2-cohortclinical trial in which the first cohort assessed for the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for the treatment of acute HCV infection inparticipants with chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This is a preplanned analysis of the first cohort, which had a planned accrual of17 participants.Results: Seventeen men (11 Hispanic, 6 white, median age 45 years) were enrolled.Most (88%) had HCV genotype-1 infection and few (24%) had the favorable IL28B CC genotype. Median baseline HCV RNA was 2 280 000 IU/mL (interquartile range, 272000-4 230 000). Ten participants (59%) achieved the primary outcome of SVR12 (90%confidence interval, 36%-78%), failing to establish noninferiority. All treatmentfailures were due to viral relapse (41%). There were no premature treatmentdiscontinuations. The only factor that differed between participants who achievedSVR vs those who relapsed was ribavirin concentration at the end of treatment.Conclusion: Sofosbuvir-ribavirin for 12 weeks for the treatment of acute HCVgenotype-1 infection in HIV-1-infected persons results in a high relapse rate.Preliminary studies of DAA combination therapies suggest improved response rates,although the adequate duration of therapy remains unclear.Clinical Trials Registration: NCT02128217.",Single arm,Y,,,sofosbuvir plus ribavirin,,,,acute HCV infection in participants with chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1,SVR12; sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment,

Here, we analyzed the effects of RG-101 therapy onantiviral immunity. Thirty-two chronic HCV patients infected with HCV genotypes1, 3, and 4 received a single subcutaneous administration of RG-101 at 2 mg/kg (n= 14) or 4 mg/kg (n = 14) or received a placebo (n = 2/dosing group). Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at multiple time points, andcomprehensive immunological analyses were performed. Following RG-101administration, HCV RNA declined in all patients (mean decline at week 2, 3.27log10 IU/mL). At week 8 HCV RNA was undetectable in 15/28 patients. Plasmainterferon-_-induced protein 10 (IP-10) levels declined significantly upon dosingwith RG-101. Furthermore, the frequency of natural killer (NK) cells increased,the proportion of NK cells expressing activating receptors normalized, and NKcell interferon-_ production decreased after RG-101 dosing. FunctionalHCV-specific interferon-_ T-cell responses did not significantly change inpatients who had undetectable HCV RNA levels by week 8 post-RG-101 injection. No increase in the magnitude of HCV-specific T-cell responses was observed at later time points, including 3 patients who were HCV RNA-negative 76 weekspostdosing.CONCLUSION: Dosing with RG-101 is associated with a restoration ofNK-cell proportions and a decrease of NK cells expressing activation receptors;however, the magnitude and functionality of ex vivo HCV-specific T-cell responsesdid not increase following RG-101 injection, suggesting that NK cells, but notHCV adaptive immunity, may contribute to HCV viral control following RG-101therapy.

Augmentation of hepatitis C virus-specific immunity and sustained virologic response.,/pubmed/28267900,"Treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has rapidly evolved into interferon-free directly acting antiviral regimens (DAA) that result in highsustained virologic response. DAAs primarily work by suppressing HCV replication and rely less on the immune system than interferon-based therapies. However, itis unclear whether the immune system recovers with suppression of HCV replicationand contributes to HCV clearance with DAA therapy. We previously demonstrated HCVclearance is associated with increased HCV-specific immunity inCHCV-GT-1-infected patients during treatment with sofosbuvir (SOF)+ribavirin(RBV). Here, we aimed to analyse changes in HCV-specific immunological responses associated with viral clearance with combination DAA therapy of SOF+ledipasvir(LDV) for 12¾weeks in CHCV-GT1 (N=14) patients who relapsed without augmentation of HCV-specific immunity during treatment with SOF+RBV. Phenotypic and functionalchanges within the T-cell compartment of PBMCs pre- and post-treatment wereanalysed. Retreatment of relapsers with LDV/SOF resulted in all patientsattaining SVR12 . Suppression of HCV was associated with a decline in T-cellexhaustion markers (CD57; Tim3; PD1) along with augmented of HCV-specific T-cell IFN-gamma responses post-treatment. Addition of LDV to SOF was associated withaugmentation of HCV-specific immunity and SVR in patients who previously failedSOF+RBV therapy without increased immunity. These findings demonstrate a noveleffect of DAA in inducing host immune responses to aid HCV clearance and achieve SVR.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Bictegravir, a novel,once-daily, unboosted INSTI, showed potent activity in a 10 day monotherapy studyand has a high in-vitro resistance barrier. On the basis of these results, we dida phase 2 trial comparing bictegravir with dolutegravir.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we recruited previouslyuntreated adults (aged _18 years) with HIV-1 infections from 22 outpatientcentres in the USA. Eligible patients had HIV-1 RNA concentrations of at least1000 copies per mL, CD4 counts of at least 200 cells per _L, estimated glomerularfiltration rates of at least 70 mL per min, and HIV-1 genotypes showingsensitivity to emtricitabine and tenofovir. We excluded patients if they werehepatitis B-co-infected or hepatitis C-co-infected, had new AIDS-definingconditions within 30 days of screening, or were pregnant. We randomly allocatedparticipants (2:1) to receive oral once-daily 75 mg bictegravir or 50 mgdolutegravir with matching placebo plus the fixed-dose combination of 200 mgemtricitabine and 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide for 48 weeks. We randomly allocatedparticipants via an interactive web system, stratified by HIV-1 RNAconcentration.

Of these 97, 24 began treatment (25%), and 19 of these 24achieved sustained virological response (79%).Conclusions.: Urban EDs serve patients with poor access to preventive careservices who have a high prevalence of HCV infection. Because ED patientsidentified with HCV infection can progress to treatment and cure with ratescomparable to ambulatory care settings, implementation of ED HCV screening shouldbe expanded.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
An effectiveness study of group psychoeducation for hepatitis C patients in community clinics.,/pubmed/28195874,"OBJECTIVE: A successful psychoeducation program for serious mental illness,PsychoEducation Responsive to Families (PERF), was modified for hepatitis C virus(HCV). An effectiveness study was carried out comparing HCV-PERF with didacticeducation.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 309 adult HCV patients was recruited from threeoutpatient settings and randomized (60% HCV-PERF, 40% didactic control). Groupsmet for 90_min bimonthly for 6 months following separate structured protocols.HCV-PERF sessions included a didactic curriculum developed uniquely for groups bymember choice, with group problem-solving and support interactions. Patients wereassessed at baseline, after the intervention, and 1 year later. Demographic andHCV-related variables and structured diagnostic interview data were obtained.RESULTS: Both groups improved significantly on major depression and alcohol anddrug use, quality of life, risk behaviors, and treatment satisfaction, andworsened on disability and perceived HCV-related problems. Intervention groupsdid not differ on outcomes.CONCLUSION: Even though the active intervention did not achieve a significantimprovement relative to the control condition, the observable improvements inboth conditions warrant further exploration of the contributions of education andsupport as potentially important elements of HCV behavioral intervention. Furtherstudy is needed to identify elements common to education interventions that maybe contributory to the improved outcomes over time.",RCT,,,,PsychoEducation Responsive to Families,didactic education,,,hepatitis C virus,major depression,
The association of elevated alanine aminotransferase levels with hepatitis E virus infections among blood donors in China.,/pubmed/28194856,"BACKGROUND: Transfusion transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerginghealth risk, yet blood donors are rarely screened for this pathogen. Many bloodcenters instituted screening of blood donors for elevated levels of alanineaminotransferase (ALT) levels to prevent hepatitis¾C virus, which has continuedin China. We evaluated whether elevated ALT levels were associated with HEV amongblood donors in China.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 9069 qualifiedvolunteer blood donors from four blood centers in China. A total of 5023 hadelevated ALT levels, that is,¾more than 40¾IU/L, and 4046 samples had normal ALT.We tested all the 9069 samples for anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-HEV IgG,and HEV antigen. Those who were positive for anti-HEV IgM or HEV antigen weretested individually for HEV RNA by polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in donors with elevated ALT levels(33.3%) was higher than those with normal ALT (24.9%; p¾<¾0.01). The prevalenceof anti-HEV IgM was similar in donations with increased ALT (1.41%) and normalALT (1.46%). More ALT-elevated donations were HEV antigen positive, 62 of 5023(1.23%), than were ALT-normal donations, seven of 4046 (0.17%; p¾<¾0.01). Sixdonors with elevated ALT levels and acute HEV infection markers (anti-HEV IgM or HEV antigen) were HEV RNA positive.CONCLUSION: Markers of active infection including HEV antigen and HEV RNA aresignificantly more common among donors with elevated ALT levels in China. Thesedata support the fact that ALT testing of donors to HEV antigen or HEV RNA would have greater specificity and exclude fewer acceptable donors.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The safety and efficacy of baclofen to reduce alcohol use in veterans with chronic hepatitis C: a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/28192622,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common among people withchronic hepatitis C (HCV) and accelerate the development of fibrosis andcirrhosis caused by HCV. Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) beta-receptoragonist, differs from medications for AUDs currently approved by the UnitedStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as it is metabolized primarily throughthe kidneys. The primary outcome of this study was to compare baclofen with aplacebo in the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol.DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial.SETTING: Hepatology clinics in four separate US Veteran Affairs Medical Centersin the United States.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eighty Veteran men and women older than 18¾yearswith chronic HCV, a comorbid AUD and current alcohol use.INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Oral baclofen was given at dosages of 0 (placebo) or30¾mg/day over 12¾weeks with concomitant manual-guided counseling.MEASUREMENTS: The primary measurement was percentage of days abstinent during the12-week study period between the baclofen and placebo groups [measured bytime-line follow-back (TLFB)]. Secondary measurements were the percentage ofVeterans who achieved complete abstinence, the percentage of Veterans whoachieved no heavy drinking between weeks 4 and 12 of the study, alcohol craving, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).FINDINGS: Primary outcome: compared with placebo, baclofen did not improve thepercentage of days abstinent.

In an independent examination of 20 patientsreceiving TVR-based triple therapy who developed viral breakthrough or relapse,the times to HCV disappearance by ART were longer than by CAP/CTM, whereas thetimes to HCV reappearance were similar. In an independent experiment of WHOstandard HCV RNA serially diluted in serum containing TVR, the analyticalsensitivities of CAP/CTM and ART were similar. However, cell cultures transfectedwith HCV and grown in medium containing TVR demonstrated that ART detected HCVRNA for a longer time than CAP/CTM.

Social mixing and correlates of injection frequency among opioid use partnerships.,/pubmed/28113118,"BACKGROUND: As resources are deployed to address the opioid overdose epidemic in the USA, it is essential that we understand the correlates of more frequentopioid injections-which has been associated not only with HIV and HCVtransmission, but also with overdose risk-to inform the development and targetingof effective intervention strategies like overdose prevention and naloxonedistribution programs. However, no studies have explored how characteristics ofopioid use partnerships may be associated within injection frequency with opioid partnerships.METHODS: Using baseline data from a trial of a behavioural intervention to reduceoverdose among opioid users in San Francisco, CA, we calculated assortativityamong opioid use partnerships by race, gender, participant-reported HIV- andHCV-status, and opioids used using Newman's assortativity coefficient (NC).Multivariable generalized estimating equations linear regression was used toexamine associations between individual- and partnership-level characteristicsand injection frequency within opioid use partnerships.RESULTS: Opioid use partnerships (n=134) reported by study participants (n=55)were assortative by race (NC=0.42, 95%CI=0.33-0.50) and participant-reportedHCV-status (NC=0.42, 95%CI=0.31-0.52). In multivariable analyses, there were moremonthly injections among sexual/romantic partnerships (_=114.4, 95%CI=60.2-168.7,p<0.001), racially concordant partnerships reported by white study participants(_=71.4, 95%CI=0.3-142.5, p=0.049), racially discordant partnerships reported by African American study participants (_=105.7, 95%CI=1.0-210.5, p=0.048), andpartnerships in which either member had witnessed the other experience anoverdose (_=81.8, 95%CI=38.9-124.6, p<0.001).CONCLUSION: Social segregation by race and HCV-status should potentially beconsidered in efforts to reach networks of opioid users. Due to higher injection frequency and greater likelihood of witnessing their partners experience anoverdose, individuals in sexual/romantic opioid use partnerships, whiteindividuals in racially homogenous partnerships, and African American individualsin heterogeneous partnerships may warrant focused attention as part of peer- and network-based overdose prevention efforts, as well as broader HIV/HCV prevention strategies. Developing and targeting overdose prevention education programs that provide information on risk factors and ways to identify overdose, as well aseffective responses, including naloxone use and rescue breathing, for morefrequently injecting networks may help reduce opioid morbidity and mortality inthese most at risk groups.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Role of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 in the Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics of Silymarin Flavonolignans in Patients with HCV and NAFLD.,/pubmed/28098838,"Silymarin is the most commonly used herbal medicine by patients with chronicliver disease. Silymarin flavonolignans undergo rapid first-pass metabolismprimarily by glucuronidation. The aims of this investigation were: (1) todetermine the association of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism with the area under theplasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) for silybin A (SA) and silybin B (SB);(2) to evaluate the effect of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism on the profile offlavonolignan glucuronide conjugates found in the plasma; and (3) to investigate the role of UGT1A1 enzyme kinetics on the pharmacokinetics of SA and SB. AUCs andmetabolic ratios for thirty-three patients with chronic liver diseaseadministered oral doses of silymarin were compared between different UGT1A1*28genotypes. The AUCs, metabolic ratios, and the profiles of major SA and SBglucuronides did not differ significantly among the three UGT1A1 genotypes. Incontrast, an increase in the proportion of sulfated flavonolignan conjugates inplasma was observed in subjects with UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype compared to subjects carrying wild type alleles. Differences in SA and SB in vitro intrinsic clearanceestimates for UGTIA1 correlated inversely with SA and SB exposures observed invivo indicating a major role for UGT1A1 in silymarin metabolism. In addition, asignificant difference in the metabolic ratio observed between patients withNAFLD and HCV suggests that any effect of UGT1A1 polymorphism may be obscured by a greater effect of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of silymarin. Takentogether, these results suggest the presence of the UGT1A1*28 allele does notcontribute significantly to a large inter-subject variability in thepharmacokinetics of silybin A and silybin B which may obscure the ability todetect beneficial effects of silymarin in patients with liver disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability,pharmacokinetics, and antiviral effect of a single dose of RG-101, a hepatocytetargeted N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated oligonucleotide that antagonisesmiR-122, in patients with chronic HCV infection with various genotypes.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase1B study, patients were randomly assigned to RG-101 or placebo (7:1). We enrolledmen and postmenopausal or hysterectomised women (aged 18-65 years) with chronicHCV genotype 1, 3, or 4 infection diagnosed at least 24 weeks before screeningwho were either treatment naive to or relapsed after interferon-_ based therapy. Patients with co-infection (hepatitis B virus or HIV infection), evidence ofdecompensated liver disease, or a history of hepatocellular carcinoma wereexcluded. Randomisation was done by an independent, unblinded, statistician usingthe SAS procedure Proc Plan. The first cohort received one subcutaneous injectionof 2 mg/kg RG-101 or placebo; the second cohort received one subcutaneousinjection of 4 mg/kg or placebo. Patients were followed up for 8 weeks (allpatients) and up to 76 weeks (patients with no viral rebound and excluding those who were randomised to the placebo group) after randomisation. The primaryobjective was safety and tolerability of RG-101. This trial was registered withEudraCT, number 2013-002978-49.FINDINGS: Between June 4, 2014, and Oct 27, 2014, we enrolled 32 patients withchronic HCV genotype 1 (n=16), 3 (n=10), or 4 (n=6) infections. In the firstcohort, 14 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 mg/kg RG-101 and twopatients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, and in the second cohort, 14 patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 mg/kg RG-101 and two patients wererandomly assigned to receive placebo. Overall, 26 of the 28 patients dosed withRG-101 reported at least one treatment-related adverse event. At week 4, themedian viral load reduction from baseline was 4à42 (IQR 3à23-5à00) and 5à07(4à19-5à35) log10 IU/mL in patients dosed with 2 mg/kg RG-101 or 4 mg/kg RG-101. Three patients had undetectable HCV RNA levels 76 weeks after a single dose ofRG-101. Viral rebound at or before week 12 was associated with the appearance of resistance associated substitutions in miR-122 binding regions in the 5' UTR ofthe HCV genome.INTERPRETATION: This study showed that one administration of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kgRG-101, a hepatocyte targeted N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated anti-miR-122oligonucleotide, was well tolerated and resulted in substantial viral loadreduction in all treated patients within 4 weeks, and sustained virologicalresponse in three patients for 76 weeks.FUNDING: Regulus Therapeutics, Inc.",RCT,,,,RG-101,placebo,,,hepatitis C virus,median viral load reduction from baseline,

The effectiveness of daclatasvir based therapy in European patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced liver disease.,/pubmed/28061762,"BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of daclatasvir inpatients whose hepatitis C threatens their life expectancy. The Named PatientProgram in Europe included patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C, a lifeexpectancy of less than 12¾months and no other treatment options.METHODS: A retrospective multi-country cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C who received daclatasvir as part of the Named Patient Program in Austria,Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Treatment responsewas defined as a sustained virologic response (unquantifiable hepatitis C RNA) at12¾weeks post treatment. We summarised the characteristics of the patients inthis cohort and estimated the rate of sustained virologic response for patientsreceiving daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin using hierarchicalBayesian modelling.RESULTS: The 249 patients included had a median age of 56¾years; most were male(78%), hepatitis C genotype 1 (75%), treatment experienced (65%) and withdecompensated cirrhosis (59%). Many had had a liver transplant before receivingdaclatasvir (40%).

Advantages and limitations of virtual online consultations in a NHS acute trust: the VOCAL mixed-methods study.,/pubmed/29939519,"BACKGROUND: There is much enthusiasm from clinicians, industry and the governmentto utilise digital technologies and introduce alternatives to face-to-faceconsultations.OBJECTIVE(S): To define good practice and inform digital technologyimplementation in relation to remote consultations via Skypeª (MicrosoftCorporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and similar technologies.DESIGN: Multilevel mixed-methods study of remote video consultations (microlevel) embedded in an organisational case study (meso level), taking account ofthe national context and wider influences (macro level).SETTING: Three contrasting clinical settings (Diabetes, Antenatal Diabetes andCancer Surgery) in a NHS acute trust.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Macro level Ð interviews with 12 national-levelstakeholders combined with document analysis. Meso level Ð longitudinalorganisational ethnography comprising over 300 hours of observations, 24 staffinterviews and analysis of 16 documents. Micro level Ð 30 video-recorded remoteconsultations; 17 matched audio-recorded face-to-face consultations. Interviewand ethnographic data were analysed thematically and theorised using strongstructuration theory. Consultations were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the Roter interaction analysis system (RIAS), producing descriptive statistics ondifferent kinds of talk and interaction.RESULTS: Policy-makers viewed remote video consultations as a way of deliveringhealth care efficiently in the context of rising rates of chronic illness andgrowing demand for services. However, the reality of establishing such servicesin a busy and financially stretched NHS acute trust proved to be far more complexand expensive than anticipated. Embedding new models of care took much time andmany resources, and required multiple workarounds. Considerable ongoing effortwas needed to adapt and align structures, processes and people within clinics andacross the organisation. For practical and safety reasons, virtual consultations were not appropriate for every patient or every consultation. By the end of this study, between 2% and 20% of all consultations were being undertaken remotely in participating clinics. Technical challenges in setting up such consultations weretypically minor, but potentially prohibitive. When clinical, technical andpractical preconditions were met, virtual consultations appeared to be safe andwere popular with both patients and staff. Compared with face-to-faceconsultations, virtual consultations were very slightly shorter, patients didslightly more talking and both parties sometimes needed to make explicit thingsthat typically remained implicit in a traditional encounter. Virtualconsultations appeared to work better when the clinician and the patient knew andtrusted each other. Some clinicians used Skype adaptively to support ad hocclinician-initiated and spontaneous patient-initiated encounters. Otherclinicians chose not to use the new service model at all.CONCLUSIONS: Virtual consultations appear to be safe, effective and convenientfor patients who are preselected by their clinicians as ÔsuitableÕ, but suchpatients represent a small fraction of clinic workloads. There are complexchallenges to embedding virtual consultation services within routine practice in the NHS. Roll-out (across the organisation) and scale-up (to other organisations)are likely to require considerable support.LIMITATIONS: The focus on a single NHS organisation raises questions about thetransferability of findings, especially quantitative data on likely uptake rates.FUTURE RESEARCH: Further studies on the micro-analysis of virtual consultationsand on the spread and scale-up of virtual consulting services are planned.FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Fatalities Due to Failure of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Devices: A Report of Six Cases.,/pubmed/29940703,"Diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 are diseases characterized by impairedregulation of blood glucose due to decreased insulin production and insulinresistance, respectively. Management of diabetes mellitus often requiresinjection of exogenous insulin. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII orinsulin pump) is a diabetes treatment modality utilizing a device to aid inregulation of glycemic control. Malfunctions in device components can have rarefatal consequences. Described in this report are six fatalities due to one suchmalfunction, the failure of plastic cannulas of CSII devices to penetrate theskin and deliver insulin, resulting in fatal diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Thecases derive from four different death investigation systems. For each case,scene and autopsy findings are presented, as well as selected toxicology andhistology findings. These cases illustrate the importance of careful examination of CSII devices in death investigations and introduce a discussion on discrepant manner of death classifications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Giant Prolactinomas: Outcomes of Multimodal Treatments for 42 Cases with Long-Term Follow-Up.,/pubmed/29940665,"Giant prolactinomas represent a rare entity of pituitary tumors so that themanagement of these patients is still a prevalent challenge at present. Payingspecial attention to the treatment strategy and outcomes, we presented a largeseries of 42 cases looking forward to share our understanding and experience inmanagement of these patients. Male patients accounted for 71.4% of this seriesand were relatively younger (35.70±2.42 vs. 52.00±3.55 years, p=0.0011) andharbored bigger tumors (14.57 vs. 7.74_cm3, p=0.0179) compared to females. Almostall of these tumors showed suprasellar extension (97.6%) and cavernous sinusinvasion (92.9%). Dopamine agonist represented an efficient method to control PRLconcentrations (98.8%) and reduce tumor burdens (81.2 %). PRL normalization wasdetected in 13 out of the 27 patients initially treated with bromocriptine (BRC) whereas none of the 14 patients with first-line operation gained a normalization of PRL concentration after surgery. Although there was no reliable predictor oftumor response, First PRL reduction was a predictive criterion for the nadir PRL level during the long-time period of follow-up for first-line bromocriptinetreatment. In conclusion, patients with giant prolactinomas did not gain morebenefits from initial surgery. Dopamine agonist (BRC) should be first-linetreatment for giant prolactinomas whereas operation merely served as a remedy foracute compression symptoms and dopamine agonist resistance. Consecutivemonitoring of serum PRL levels in the early stage of initial BRC treatment isuseful for evaluation of therapeutic effect and further therapeutic decision.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MicroRNA-204-3p Attenuates High Glucose-Induced MPC5 Podocytes Apoptosis by Targeting Braykinin B2 Receptor.,/pubmed/29940664,"BACKGROUND: Previous study has been reported that braykinin B2 receptor (Bdkrb2) involves in high glucose-induced renal and podocytes injuries. However, therehave been some studies with contradictory results that Bdkrb2 has a protectiveeffect on hyperglycemia-induced injuries in vivo and in vitro. The purpose of thepresent study was carried out to further investigate the post-transcriptionalregulatory mechanism of microRNA (miR) in high glucose-treated podocytes bytargeting Bdkrb2 signaling in vitro.METHODS: The CCK-8 and flow cytometry were performed to measure the cellviability and apoptosis. Gene and protein expression were assayed by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively.RESULTS: High glucose treatment decreased cell viability and induced membrane andDNA damage, as well as apoptosis in podocytes. High glucose treatment alsoincreased the expression of Bdkrb2, which was blocked by miR-204-3p mimicstransfection in podocytes. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter activity showedthat miR-204-3p was directly targeted to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) ofBdkrb2. High glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in podocytes were reservedby miR-204-3p mimics transfection, while the effects of miR-204-3p mimics in highglucose-treated podocytes were neutralized by overexpressed Bdkrb2.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that miR-204-3p may play a protective role in high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in podocytes throughdown-regulation of Bdkrb2.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) Interacts with Camp Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) to Modulate Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (7-36) Amide (GLP-1) Secretion by Intestinal L Cell.,/pubmed/29940597,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Type II diabetes is a complex, chronic, and progressive disease.Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-6) amide (GLP-1) is a gut hormone released from the L cells which stimulates insulin secretion, and promotes insulin gene expressionand _-cell growth and differentiation. Elevated levels of hormone secreted by Lcells are an important reason for diabetes improvement. GLP-1 secretion has been reported to be regulated by farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a transcriptional sensor for bile acids which also acts on glucose metabolism. Herein, we attempted toevaluate the effect of FXR on GLP-1 secretion in mouse enteroendocrine L celllines, STC-1 and GLUTag, and to investigate the underlying mechanism.METHODS: ELISA and Western blot assays were employed to examine the levels ofGLP-1 and FXR, and the effect of FXR on GLP-1 secretion; online database,including BioGRID and KEGG were used to identify the potential interactionsbetween FXR and proteins and involved pathways; GST pull-down andCo-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to validate FXR-CREBinteraction; Luciferase reporter gene assays were used for CREB transcriptionalactivity determination.RESULTS: FXR inversely regulated GLP-1 secretion in the mouse enteroendocrine Lcell lines, GLUTag and STC-1. A total of 24 nonredundant human proteins wereshown to be related to FXR by BioGRID; KEGG pathway analysis showed that FXR was related to glucagon signaling pathway, particularly with the transcriptionalactivators CREB, PGC1_, Sirt1 and CBP. CREB could positively regulate GLP-1secretion in GLUTag and STC-1 cells. FXR combined with CREB to inhibit itstranscriptional activity, thus inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexintype 1 (PCSK1) protein level and GLP-1 secretion.CONCLUSION: In the present study, we demonstrated a negative regulation of GLP-1 secretion by FXR in L cell lines, GLUTag and STC-1; FXR exerts its function in L cells through interacting with CREB, a crucial transcriptional regulator ofcAMP-CREB signaling pathway, to inhibit its transcriptional activity. TargetingFXR to rescue GLP-1 secretion may be a promising strategy for type II diabetes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring on Patient's Awareness and Goal Attainment Under Antihypertensive Therapy: The Factors Influencing Results in Anti-HypertenSive Treatment (FIRST) Study.,/pubmed/29940594,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite availability of a broad spectrum of blood pressure(BP)-lowering drugs many hypertensive patients do not attain BP goals. We aimedto evaluate the influence of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on patient'sawareness and attainment of BP goals under antihypertensive treatment withirbesartan alone or in combination with hydro-chlorothiazide.METHODS: In total, 1,268 patients with arterial hypertension were enrolled in theFactors Influencing Results in anti-hypertenSive Treatment (FIRST) study by 348general practitioners and internal medicine specialists across Switzerland.Patients selected for HBPM received detailed information and training on BPself-management. The study endpoints included patient's awareness and attainment of BP goals, and the efficacy and tolerability of antihypertensive treatment at 3months.RESULTS: Overall, the mean age was 61±13 years and 616 (49%) were women. The meansystolic/diastolic BP was 161±17/96±11 mmHg, and 239 (19%) patients had diabetes mellitus. 758 (60%) patients were instructed to use HBPM. Both the proportion of patients aware of their BP goals (81% vs. 70%; p< 0.001) and the percentage ofpatients reaching their BP goal (64% vs. 57%; p=0.028) were higher in those with vs. without HBPM. The mean reduction in systolic/diastolic BP was 23.8/13.2 mmHg.Only 35 (3.0%) patients discontinued antihypertensive therapy.CONCLUSION: In a large Swiss cohort of patients with arterial hypertension,information and training on BP self-measurement and direct involvement ofpatients by using HBPM led to improvement in BP control.

Analysis of Genes Involved in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: Comparisons of 'Trigger' and 'Substrate' Differences.,/pubmed/29940585,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent research has improved our understanding of the pulmonary vein and surrounding left atrial (LA-PV) junction and the left atrial appendage(LAA), which are considered the 'trigger' and 'substrate' in the development ofatrial fibrillation (AF), respectively. Herein, with the aim of identifying theunderlying potential genetic mechanisms, we compared differences in geneexpression between LA-PV junction and LAA specimens via bioinformatic analysis.METHODS: Microarray data of AF (GSE41177) were downloaded from the GeneExpression Omnibus database. In addition, linear models for microarray data limmapowers differential expression analyses and weighted correlation network analysis(WGCNA) were applied.RESULTS: From the differential expression analyses, 152 differentially expressed genes and hub genes, including LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP, wereidentified. Our analysis revealed that the maps of extracellular matrix(ECM)-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathways, and ventricularcardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis were significantly enriched. In addition, theWGCNA results showed high correlations between genes and related genetic clustersto external clinical characteristics. Maps of the ECM-receptor interactions,chemokine signaling pathways, and the cell cycle were significantly enriched inthe genes of corresponding modules and closely associated with AF duration, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular ejection function, respectively. Similarly,mapping of the TNF signaling pathway indicated significant association withgenetic traits of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: The ECM-receptor interaction as a possible central node ofcomparison between LA-PV and LAA samples reflected the special functional rolesof 'triggers' and 'substrates' and may be closely associated with AF duration.Furthermore, LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP genes may be implicatedin the occurrence and maintenance of AF through their interactions with eachother.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age and the Cord Blood Lipidomic Profile in Late Preterm and Term Infants.,/pubmed/29940570,"BACKGROUND: Lipid metabolism is vital to fetal development and cardiometabolichealth and the final weeks of gestation are known to be a time of intensemetabolic activity. New techniques such as lipidomics allow investigation of acomplex lipidomic profile in infants.OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to (1) describe variations in lipidomic profilein late preterm and term infants and (2) compare variations to an adult lipidomicprofile with known clinical implications.METHODS: The Barwon Infant Study (n = 1,074) is a population-derived pre-birthcohort study. The lipidomic profile of cord blood was measured by liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry in 225 participants and the association between gestational age and lipidomic profile was investigated using multiple linearregression adjusting for birth weight, exposure to labour, and infant sex.Patterns of association with gestational age across the lipidomic profile werecompared with associations between body mass index (BMI) and lipidomic profileobserved among adults in the San Antonia Family Heart Study (n = 994).RESULTS: Gestational age was independently associated with the abundances of 39% of lipid species. Variations in the lipidomic profile with increasing gestationalage were comparable to some variations observed in association with increasingBMI among adults.CONCLUSION: There is a strong relationship between gestational age and the cordblood lipid profile at birth, providing further evidence for the importance ofmetabolic changes of late gestation. A number of the variations in the lipidprofile with increasing gestational age are analogous to differences observed in the adult lipid profile with an increasing BMI.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Synthesis and biological evaluations of marine oxohexadecenoic acids: PPARë±/ë_ dual agonism and anti-diabetic target gene effects.,/pubmed/29940464,"Obesity and associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes(T2D) have reached epidemic proportions. Several natural products have beenreported as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists,functioning as lead compounds towards developing new anti-diabetic drugs due toadverse side effects of existing PPAR drugs. We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic acid (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic acid (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis,pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturallyoccurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficientmaterial for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciabledose-dependent activation of PPAR_ and -_, with EC50 values in the micromolarrange, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive adipogenesis when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but withlowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation comparedto the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation ofPPAR_ and C/EBP_ expression. Importantly, whole transcriptome analysis shows thatboth compounds induce anti-diabetic gene programs in adipocytes by upregulatinginsulin-sensitizing adipokines and repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Metformin Use Is Associated with Improved Survival in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy.,/pubmed/29940252,"PURPOSE: Metformin is commonly prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetesmellitus (DM). We hypothesize that metformin plus androgen deprivation therapy(ADT) may be beneficial in combination. The objective was to assess thiscombination in a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced PCa.METHODS: Using national Veterans Affairs databases, we identified all mendiagnosed with PCa between 2000-2008 that were treated with ADT with follow-upthrough May of 2016. Exclusions included treatment with ADT for ²6 months or ADT receipt concurrently with localized radiation. Three patient cohorts weredeveloped: No DM, DM no metformin, and DM on metformin. Cox proportional hazards ratios were calculated for overall survival (OS), skeletal-related events (SRE)and cancer-specific survival (CSS).RESULTS: The cohort after exclusions consisted of 87,344 patients: 61% were noDM, 22% were DM no metformin, and 17% were DM on metformin. Cox proportionalhazards analysis for OS showed improved survival in DM on metformin (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.78-0.86) vs. DM no metformin (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08) with no DM asreferent group.

Lifestyle and progression of lower urinary tract symptoms in German men-results from the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort.,/pubmed/29940234,"OBJECTIVES: To examine if lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) progression wasrelated to anthropometric and lifestyle factors.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The analysis included 5,495 men who participated in theEPIC-Heidelberg cohort (recruited 1994-1998) and who reported an InternationalProstate Symptom Score (IPSS) < 8 at follow-up 4 (FUP4, 2007-2009), had notreported taking _-adrenoreceptor antagonists or 5-_ reductase inhibitors orprostate surgery for BPH/LUTS treatment. LUTS progression was defined as an IPSS ³ 8 at FUP5 (2010-2012). Using logistic regression analysis, education, maritalstatus, satisfaction with life, satisfaction with health, history of diabetes andof hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), waistcircumference, and physical activity were examined as potential LUTS risk factorsadjusting for age.RESULTS: Increase in BMI between baseline and FUP4 of ³ 2 BMI units was relatedto LUTS progression (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.08-1.57) compared with stable BMI. Compared to men who were very satisfied withlife at baseline, those who were satisfied (1.28, 1.11-1.47), unsatisfied (1.80, 1.31-2.46) or very unsatisfied with life (1.43, 0.62-3.34) were more likely toreport LUTS progression. Men with longer education had higher odds of LUTSprogression than men with primary education only (1.25, 1.06-1.48). Adjusting forBMI or lifestyle factors did not attenuate these associations. Smoking habits,alcohol consumption, physical activity, self-reported history of diabetes orhypertension, and marital status were not related with LUTS progression.CONCLUSION: Our results confirm some, but not all previously observed riskfactors for LUTS progression.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Do we need biomarkers for diabetics progressing to heart failure?,/pubmed/29940223,"There is a cardiovascular unfavorable duet consisting of arterial hypertensionand diabetes that is related with increased risk of heart failure. The latter is highly prevalent in this setting of dysregulation of glucose metabolism and high hemodynamic load and identifying predictors of incidence of heart failure withpreserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a research and clinical need. Towards thisend the variability of glucose regulation represent a novel dynamic way tocomprehend and study the impact of glycemia. The results of the published studyhighlight the independent association of glycated hemoglobin A1c variability withthe development of HFpEF in hypertensive diabetic patients. Based on the above,the effect of diverse antidiabetic therapies on glycemic control variability aswell as the overall management of these patients in order to reduce the risk ofHFpEF remain essential for the modern cardiologist. The growing epidemic of both diabetes mellitus and heart failure (HF) is an emerging clinical reality.1-3 The prevalence of diabetes mellitus type II has augmented from 4.7% to 8.5% in thelast 25 years, whereas heart failure is currently found in 11.8% of the generalpopulation.1-4 Hypertension is closely linked to unfavorable overallcardiovascular prognosis via diverse mechanisms including interaction withdysmetabolic pathways, functional and structural cardiac alterations.2,4 Focusingon patients with diagnosed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, theyare commonly diabetic and suffer from long-standing hypertension.4.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Epigallocatechin gallate improves insulin resistance in HepG2 cells through alleviating inflammation and lipotoxicity.,/pubmed/29940201,"IMS: High levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), inflammation andoxidative stress are important causes for insulin resistance (IR) and type 2diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms ofEGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells.METHODS: HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose, 0.25 mM palmitic acid (PA),or 50 _M EGCG for 24 h.RESULTS: EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCGmarkedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factorsincluding nuclear factor _B (NF-_B), tumor necrosis factor-_, interleukin-6,reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and p53 protein, and markedly increased superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCGsignificantly downregulated the levels of FFAs, triacylglycerol and cholesterolin HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein and its downstreamproteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor _ coactivator (PGC)-1_ weresignificantly increased, and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c (SREBP-1c)protein, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG inHepG2. Moreover, the foregoing effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GLUT2.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that EGCG improved IR, possibly throughameliorating glucose (25mM) and PA (0.25mM)-induced inflammation, oxidativestress, and FFAs via the GLUT2/PGC-1_/SREBP-1c/FAS pathway in HepG2 cells.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MicroRNA: a new generation therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy.,/pubmed/29940170,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most prevalent lethal complications ofdiabetes that leads to end stage renal disease. Although several clinicalapproaches exist to attenuate DN, there is not curative treatment to date. DN is complicated, as it involves several simultaneous molecular pathways. Some naturaland synthetic molecules have been reported to inhibit some specific pathogenicsignal transduction in DN. However, the complications of DN still remainuncontrolled. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that can bind to the 3'UTR of their target mRNAs to participate in epigenetic regulation of their downstream signalling molecules. Therefore, miRNAs have a potential role inregulating the pathogenesis of several diseases. Recent studies have identifiedthe roles of several miRNAs in the signalling cascade involved in DNpathophysiology. Therefore, miRNAs are an attractive therapeutic target in DN.However, further research is needed to identify the key miRNAs in DN and theirspecific functions at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Thisreview aimed to provide current information for different miRNAs involved in DNand to provide the future probabilities of miRNA-based therapies in DN.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Correlation between PAI-1, leptin and ferritin with HOMA in HIV/AIDS patients.",/pubmed/29940157,"BACKGROUND: Data about correlation of interleukins (IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, monocytechemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF_), ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with homeostasis model assessment(HOMA) in HIV/AIDS patients are still limited. Therefore the aim of this studywas to evaluate the possible correlations of serum levels of PAI-1, leptin andferritin with HOMA in HIV/AIDS patients treated with combined antiretroviraltherapy (cART).METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 64 HIV/AIDS patients, allCaucasians, receiving cART at the HIV/AIDS Centre, Belgrade, Serbia. PAI-1,leptin, ferritin and insulin levels were measured using the Metabolic SyndromeArray I (Randox Laboratories Ltd., London, UK), while adiponectin and resistinlevels were measured using Metabolic Syndrome Array II (Randox Laboratories Ltd.,London, UK), interleukins (IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10),MCP-1, TNF-_ as well as VEGF was measured using Cytokine Array I (RandoxLaboratories Ltd., London, UK). Insulin resistance was determined using thehomeostasis model assessment index (HOMA). Multicollinearity of independentvariables in multivariate model was analyzed using Variance Inflation Factor.RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between HOMA and waist circumference, body mass index, patients' age, number of cART combinations and triglycerides (p_=_0.001, p_=_0.001, p_=_0.050, p_=_0.044, p_=_0.002,respectively). HOMA negatively correlated with levels of high density lipoprotein(HDL) (Rho_=_-0.282; p_=_0.025). PAI-1 (Rho_=_0.334; p_=_0.007) and leptin(Rho_=_0.492; p_=_0.001) together with ferritin (Rho_=_0.396, p_=_0.001)positively and significantly correlated with HOMA. Levels of IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, adiponectin, MCP-1, resistin, TNF-_, CRP andVEGF did not significantly correlate with HOMA. Further, multiple logisticregression showed that there is a statistically significant correlation betweenPAI, leptin and ferritin with HOMA levels (p_=_0.042; p_<_0.001, p_=_0.009).CONCLUSIONS: We showed significant correlation between PAI-1, leptin andferritin, independently of each other with HOMA, in HIV/AIDS patients on cART.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A cell-based assay for the detection of pathogenic anti-voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies in immunoglobulin G from patients with type 1 diabetes.,/pubmed/29940155,"Recent studies have postulated the presence of functional autoantibodies (Abs)against L-type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the serum of patientswith type 1 diabetes, with various proposed physiological consequences, bothislet cell associated and extra-glandular. Arguably, the most potentiallydamaging effect reported for these Abs is induction of apoptosis in pancreaticbeta (_) cells, yet a convincing pathogenic mechanism remains to be demonstrated.In the current study, we report an assay of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress induction in the rat insulinoma cell line Rin A12, as determined by 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescence detection by flowcytometry. We demonstrate that incubation of Rin A12 cells with immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing anti-VGCC activity from patients with T1D mediates a significantincrease in ROS, with subsequent induction of apoptosis, as determined bypositivity for annexin V expression. Neither T1D patient-derived IgG lackinganti-VGCC activity or IgG from healthy donors altered ROS or annexin Vexpression, indicating the new assay is specific for the detection of functional anti-VGCC Abs. Subsequent screening of IgG samples derived from individualpatients indicated a prevalence of approximately 75% in a cohort of 20 patientswith T1D. The new cell-based assay provides, for the first time, experimentalevidence supporting a plausible pathophysiological mechanism underlying anti-VGCCAb-mediated apoptosis induction in _ cells. Additionally, the assay is aconsiderable advance on previously published methods for detecting andcharacterising the functional activity of anti-VGCC Abs in patient-derivedsamples.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery for Glycemic Control in Noncritical Care.,/pubmed/29940126,"Background In patients with diabetes, hospitalization can complicate theachievement of recommended glycemic targets. There is increasing evidence that a closed-loop delivery system (artificial pancreas) can improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes. We wanted to investigate whether a closed-loopsystem could also improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes whowere receiving noncritical care. Methods In this randomized, open-label trialconducted on general wards in two tertiary hospitals located in the UnitedKingdom and Switzerland, we assigned 136 adults with type 2 diabetes who requiredsubcutaneous insulin therapy to receive either closed-loop insulin delivery (70patients) or conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy, according to localclinical practice (66 patients). The primary end point was the percentage of timethat the sensor glucose measurement was within the target range of 100 to 180 mg per deciliter (5.6 to 10.0 mmol per liter) for up to 15 days or until hospitaldischarge. Results The mean (±SD) percentage of time that the sensor glucosemeasurement was in the target range was 65.8±16.8% in the closed-loop group and41.5±16.9% in the control group, a difference of 24.3±2.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.6 to 30.0; P<0.001); values above the target rangewere found in 23.6±16.6% and 49.5±22.8% of the patients, respectively, adifference of 25.9±3.4 percentage points (95% CI, 19.2 to 32.7; P<0.001). Themean glucose level was 154 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter) in theclosed-loop group and 188 mg per deciliter (10.4 mmol per liter) in the controlgroup (P<0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in theduration of hypoglycemia (as defined by a sensor glucose measurement of <54 mgper deciliter; P=0.80) or in the amount of insulin that was delivered (mediandose, 44.4 U and 40.2 U, respectively; P=0.50). No episode of severe hypoglycemiaor clinically significant hyperglycemia with ketonemia occurred in either trialgroup. Conclusions Among inpatients with type 2 diabetes receiving noncriticalcare, the use of an automated, closed-loop insulin-delivery system resulted insignificantly better glycemic control than conventional subcutaneous insulintherapy, without a higher risk of hypoglycemia.

Why Effective Interventions Do Not Work for All Patients: Exploring Variation in Response to a Chronic Disease Management Intervention.,/pubmed/29939912,"BACKGROUND: Half of all Americans have a chronic disease. Promoting healthybehaviors to decrease this burden is a national priority. A number of behavioral interventions have proven efficacy; yet even the most effective of these has highlevels of nonresponse.OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explore variation in response to an evidence-based community health worker (CHW) intervention for chronic disease management.RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a convergent parallel design that combined a randomized controlled trial with a qualitative process evaluation that triangulated chartabstraction, in-depth interviews and participant observation.SUBJECTS: Eligible patients lived in a high-poverty region and were diagnosedwith 2 or more of the following chronic diseases: diabetes, obesity, hypertensionor tobacco dependence. There were 302 patients in the trial, 150 of whom wererandomly assigned to the CHW intervention. Twenty patients and their CHWs wereincluded in the qualitative evaluation.RESULTS: We found minimal differences between responders and nonresponders bysociodemographic or clinical characteristics. A qualitative process evaluationrevealed that health behavior change was challenging for all patients and mostexperienced failure (ie, gaining weight or relapsing with cigarettes) along theway. Responders seemed to increase their resolve after failed attempts at health behavior change, while nonresponders became discouraged and ""shut down.""CONCLUSIONS: Failure is a common and consequential aspect of health behaviorchange; a deeper understanding of failure should inform chronic diseaseinterventions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Associations of CAHPS Composites With Global Ratings of the Doctor Vary by Medicare Beneficiaries' Health Status.,/pubmed/29939911,"ESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Care coordination among health care providers is essentialfor high-quality care and it is strongly associated with overall ratings ofdoctors. Care coordination may be especially important for sicker and chronicallyill patients because of the multiple providers involved in their care. This studyexamines whether the association of care coordination with global ratings ofone's personal doctor varies by number of chronic conditions and self-ratedhealth.STUDY DESIGN: We used nationally representative Medicare Consumer Assessment ofHealthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data to evaluate carecoordination, doctor communication, getting needed care, getting care quickly,count of 6 chronic conditions (angina, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, diabetes, heart attack, stroke), self-rated general health (5-pointscale, poor to excellent, scored linearly), and interactions among them aspredictors of the CAHPS global rating of personal doctor (scored 0-100 with 100being best possible personal doctor) using linear regression models. The analyticsample included 242,871 Medicare fee-for-service and managed care beneficiariesin 2013: 56% female; 14% 18-64, 47% 65-74, 27% 75-84, and 11% 85 and older; and48% high school education or less.RESULTS: The CAHPS composites (of care coordination, doctor communication,getting needed care, and getting care quickly) and number of chronic conditionswere significantly positively associated with ratings of personal doctor(P<0.05). Care coordination and doctor communication had a stronger associationwith positive ratings of the personal doctor among those with worse self-ratedhealth (P<0.001).DISCUSSION: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that patients in worsehealth weigh care coordination more heavily in global physician assessments than patients in better health. Emphasis on improving care coordination, especiallyfor patients in poorer health, may improve patients' overall assessments of theirproviders. The study provides further evidence for the importance of carecoordination experiences in the era of patient-centered care.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis Affects Sphingomyelin Signaling Pathway in Rats.,/pubmed/29939906,"OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and severe gastrointestinalinflammatory disease with poorly understood pathogenesis. We adoptedcerulein-induced pancreatitis, a well-established rat model shearing similaritieswith human AP, to determine the disease background. Special interest was placedon sphingolipids, because their signaling pathways are involved in manypathological states including hepatic steatosis, heart infarction, or pancreatic origin type 1 diabetes.METHODS: Sphingolipid levels in the blood and pancreas were determined by themeans of chromatography (thin-layer and high-performance liquid chromatography).RESULTS: We found that AP leads to activation of ceramide de novo synthesispathway, as evidenced by a significant increment in sphinganine, that is,ceramide synthesis precursor, content (+3.8-fold). Surprisingly, despite thereported growth in sphinganine concentration, we observed a reduced (-38%)ceramide level in the pancreas of rats with AP. The results could be explained bysubsequent hydrolysis of ceramide to other secondary messengers, that is,sphingosine (+4-fold) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (+3-fold).CONCLUSIONS: Because it is known that sphingosine-1-phosphate and some of itsanalogs could have a protective role against AP complications, our findings maycontribute to elaboration of new therapeutic strategies in the management of thissevere medical condition.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prevalence and predictors of hypoglycemia in South Korea.,/pubmed/29939502,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the prevalence and predictors ofhypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using South Korea'snationwide healthcare database.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort and nested case-control analyses wereconducted to estimate the prevalence and predictors of hypoglycemia,respectively.METHODS: A cohort of 2,273,481 patients with T2D was followed to estimate the1-year prevalence of hypoglycemia. Total hypoglycemia was identified usingoutpatient, inpatient, or emergency department visit data containing a diagnosis code for hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with inpatientadmission or emergency care. Within the T2D cohort, cases with hypoglycemia were identified, and up to 4 controls were randomly selected after matching by sex,age, and cohort entry date. Possible predictive factors included insurance type, medical institution type, hypoglycemic history, antidiabetic drugs, CharlsonComorbidity Index score, and diabetic complications. We conducted conditionallogistic regression analyses to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs to identify predictors of hypoglycemia.RESULTS: The prevalences of total and severe hypoglycemia were 1.38% and 0.96%,respectively. Those with a history of hypoglycemia had the highest risk for afurther hypoglycemic event (aOR, 16.71; 95% CI, 15.62-17.88). Use of combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylurea was highly associated with severehypoglycemia (aOR, 15.09; 95% CI, 13.60-16.74). Among diabetic complications, thepresence of nephropathy was the greatest predictive factor (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI,1.73-1.85).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of hypoglycemia or receiving combinedantidiabetic therapy must be appropriately managed to achieve optimal glycemiccontrol without significant risk of hypoglycemia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Identification of Comprehensive Metabotypes Associated with Cardiometabolic Diseases in the Population-Based KORA Study.,/pubmed/29939495,"SCOPE: Metabotyping describes the grouping of metabolically similar individuals. We aimed to identify valid metabotypes in a large cohort for targeted dietaryintervention, e.g. for disease prevention.METHODS AND RESULTS: We grouped 1729 adults aged 32-77 years of the Germanpopulation-based KORA F4 study (2006-2008) using k-means cluster analysis basedon 34 biochemical and anthropometric parameters. We identified threemetabolically distinct clusters showing significantly different biochemicalparameter concentrations. Cardiometabolic disease status was determined atbaseline in the F4 study and at the 7-year follow-up termed FF4 (2013/2014) tocompare disease prevalence and incidence between clusters. Cluster 3 showed themost unfavorable marker profile with the highest prevalence of cardiometabolicdiseases. Also, disease incidence was higher in cluster 3 compared to clusters 2 and 1, respectively, for hypertension (41.2%/25.3%/18.2%), type 2 diabetes(28.3%/5.1%/2.0%), hyperuricemia/gout (10.8%/2.3%/0.7%), dyslipidemia(19.2%/18.3%/5.6%), all metabolic (54.5%/36.8%/19.7%) and all cardiovascular(6.3%/5.5%/2.3%) diseases together.CONCLUSION: Cluster analysis based on an extensive set of biochemical andanthropometric parameters allows the identification of comprehensive metabotypes that were distinctly different in cardiometabolic disease occurrence. As a nextstep, targeted dietary strategies should be developed with the goal of preventingdiseases, especially in cluster 3. This article is protected by copyright.

Amiloride resolves resistant edema and hypertension in a patient with nephrotic syndrome; a case report.,/pubmed/29939487,"Sodium and fluid retention is a hallmark and a therapeutic challenge of thenephrotic syndrome (NS). Studies support the ""overfill"" theory of NS withpathophysiological proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)which explains the common observation of suppressed renin -angiotensin system andpoor therapeutic response to ACE inhibitors. Blockade of ENaC by the diureticamiloride would be a rational intervention compared to the traditionally usedloop diuretics. We describe a 38-year-old male patient with type1 diabetes whodeveloped severe hypertension (200/140ÊmmHg), progressive edema (of at least10ÊL), and overt proteinuria (18.5Êg/24Êh), despite combined administration offive antihypertensive drugs. Addition of amiloride (5Êmg/day) to treatmentresulted in resolution of edema, weight loss of 7Êkg, reduction in blood pressure(150/100-125/81ÊmmHg), increased 24Êh urinary sodium excretion(127-165Êmmol/day), decreased eGFR (41-29ÊmL/min), and increased plasma potassiumconcentration (4.6-7.8Êmmol/L). Blocking of ENaC mobilizes nephrotic edema andlowers blood pressure in NS. However, acute kidney injury and dangeroushyperkalemia is a potential risk if amiloride is added to multiple otherantihypertensive medications as ACEi and spironolactone. The findings supportthat ENaC is active in NS and is a relevant target in adult NS patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Diet Enriched in Olive Oil Attenuates Placental Dysfunction in Rats with Gestational Diabetes Induced by Intrauterine Programming.,/pubmed/29939470,"SCOPE: Offspring from rats with mild diabetes develop gestational diabetes (GDM).We tested the hypothesis that an olive oil-supplemented diet attenuates placentaloxidative stress/inflammation, activation of mTOR signaling and inhibition ofPPAR_ and fetal overgrowth in GDM offspring from mild diabetic rats.METHODS AND RESULTS: Female offspring from rats with mild diabetes (group thatdeveloped GDM) and controls were fed with either a standard diet or a 6% oliveoil-supplemented diet during pregnancy. On day 21 of pregnancy, plasma glucoselevels in mothers and fetuses were increased in the GDM group independently ofthe diet. Fetal overgrowth and activation of placental mTOR signaling werepartially prevented in the olive oil-treated GDM group. Placental PPAR_ proteinexpression was decreased in GDM rats independently of the diet. However,increases in placental lipoperoxidation, connective tissue growth factor andmatrix metalloproteinase 2 levels were prevented by the olive oil-enriched diet.CONCLUSION: Diets enriched in olive oil attenuate placental dysfunction and fetalovergrowth in rats with GDM induced by intrauterine programming.

Lessons learned from lifestyle prevention trials in gestational diabetes mellitus.,/pubmed/29939439,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk ofadverse outcomes for mother and infant both at birth and later in life.

At-risk women often seem reluctant to engage in lifestyle changes and frequently cannot adhere to recommended interventions even within a clinical trial setting. Many trialshave not considered the heterogeneity of diabetes first discovered in pregnancy, something of importance into the future.

The time lag prior to the rise in glucose requirements to maintain stable glycaemia during moderate exercise in a fasted insulinaemic state is of short duration and unaffected by the level at which glycaemia is maintained in Type 1 diabetes.,/pubmed/29939421,"AIMS: To determine the duration of the low hypoglycaemia risk period after thestart of moderate-intensity exercise performed under basal insulinaemicconditions and whether this period is affected by the level at which glycaemia ismaintained under these conditions.METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized counterbalanced study. Eightparticipants with Type 1 diabetes (mean ± sd age 21.5 ± 4.0 years) underwenteither a euglycaemic (5-6 mmol/l) or hyperglycaemic clamp (9-10 mmol/l) onseparate days and were infused with insulin at basal rates and [6,6-2 H]glucosewhile cycling for 40 min at 50% maximum oxygen consumption rate. The main outcomemeasures were the glucose infusion rates required to maintain stable glycaemiaand glucoregulatory hormone levels, and rates of glucose appearance anddisappearance.RESULTS: During the first 20 min of exercise, the glucose infusion rate did notincrease significantly, irrespective of the level at which glycaemia wasmaintained, but increased acutely between 20 and 25 min under both conditions.Maintaining higher glycaemia resulted in higher glucose infusion rate during, butnot early post-exercise. With the exception of epinephrine, the glucoregulatoryhormone levels and rates of glucose appearance and disappearance were similarbetween conditions.CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the levels at which glycaemia is maintained, there isa 20-min low exogenous glucose demand period during which the exogenous glucoserequirements to maintain stable glycaemia do not increase during moderateexercise performed at basal insulin level.

Nephrotoxicity and Renal Pathophysiology: A Contemporary Perspective.,/pubmed/29939355,"The kidney consists of numerous cell types functionally organized into thenephron, which is the basic functional unit of the kidney. Any stimuli thatinduce loss of these cells can induce kidney damage and renal failure. The cause of renal failure can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Extrinsic causes includecardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, sepsis, and lung and liver failure.Intrinsic causes include glomerular nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, renalfibrosis, tubular cell death and stones. The kidney plays a prominent role inmediating the toxicity of numerous drugs, environmental pollutants and naturalsubstances. Drugs known to be nephrotoxic include several cancer therapeutics,drugs of abuse, antibiotics and radiocontrast agents. Environmental pollutantsknown to target the kidney include cadmium, mercury, arsenic, lead,trichloroethylene, bromate, brominated-flame retardants, diglycolic acid andethylene glycol. Natural nephrotoxicants include aristolochic acids andmycotoxins such as ochratoxin, fumonisin B1 and citrinin. There are severalcommon characteristics between mechanisms of renal failure induced bynephrotoxicants and extrinsic causes. This common ground exists primarily due to similarities in the molecular mechanisms mediating renal cell death. This review summarizes the current state of the field of nephrotoxicity. It emphasizesintegrating our understanding of nephrotoxicity with pathological-induced renalfailure. Such approaches are needed to address major questions in the field,which include the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of both acute and chronicrenal failure, and the progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidneydisease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
IGF2-derived miR-483-3p contributes to macrosomia through regulating trophoblast proliferation by targeting RB1CC1.,/pubmed/29939354,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-derivedmiR-483-3p in macrosomia?SUMMARY ANSWER: IGF2-derived intronic miR-483-3p is overexpressed in macrosomiaplacentas, and miR-483-3p prompts HTR-8/SVneo extravillous trophoblast cell line proliferation through down-regulation of its target RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1(RB1CC1).WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Macrosomia is a common pregnancy-associated disease andcauses a number of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. The development ofmacrosomia is reportedly attributable to over proliferation of the placentalcells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the development of fetal and placenta by regulating their target genes. Here, we investigated the role ofIGF2-derived intronic miR-483-3p in macrosomia.STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION: The expression of IGF2, miR-483-3p and its targetgene in placental tissues from 30 pregnant women who had macrosomia was compared to those of 30 gestation-matched healthy pregnant controls. For in vitro studies,the human first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line, HTR-8/SVneo cellwas used.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Placenta tissues were collected frompregnant women who had macrosomia without diabetes or other complications(nÊ=Ê30) and healthy pregnant controls (nÊ=Ê30). HTR-8/SVneo cells weretransfected with specific miRNA mimics or inhibitors. MiRNA and mRNA isolatedfrom placenta tissues or cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR.Protein was measured by western blot. Cell proliferation was assayed using acolorimetric proliferation assay method. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzedby flow cytometry. The putative targets of miR-483-3p were predicted using theTargetScan, miRanda, miRDB and DIANA algorithms. Dual luciferase reporter assaywas used to measure the relationship of miR-483-3p and RB1CC1.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: IGF2-derived miR-483-3p was overexpressed inmacrosomia placentas. miR-483-3p promoted proliferation in HTR-8/SVneo cells and had a positive relationship with its host gene IGF2. Subsequently, RB1CC1 wasconfirmed as a direct target of miR-483-3p, which may be an important mediator ofcell growth regulation for miR-483-3p.LARGE SCALE DATA: n/a.LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The level of IGF2 and its intronic miR-483-3p inthe serum of these participants was not investigated. Further studies arerequired to understand the mechanisms underlying the cause of the increase ofIGF2 and miR-483-3p in macrosomia.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings give a new insight into therole of intronic miRNA and its host gene in the development of macrosomia.Furthermore, it may offer a new target for prognostic and therapeuticintervention for macrosomia.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by awards fromNational Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81401213, 81673217, 81703260), Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent (No. QNRC2016110), Jiangsu OverseasVisiting Scholar Program for University Prominent Young & Middle-aged Teachersand Presidents, the Priority Academic Program for the Development of JiangsuHigher Education Institutions (Public Health and Preventive Medicine), theEducation Department of Jiangsu Province (No. 16KJB330010), the Science andTechnology Department of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20160227), the ChinaPostdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (No. 2016M601892).

Avoiding Hypoglycemia: The use of Insulin Pump combined with Continuous Glucose Monitor in Type 1 Diabetes Crossing a Rocky Gorge.,/pubmed/29939323,"Background: Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and ContinuousGlucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS) have been proven very effective in diabetesmanagement.Aim: This study evaluated the usefulness of these devices during prolonged,intense physical activity in an uncontrolled natural environment away from theclinical research center.Design: Non-randomized, prospective, observational study.Methods: During the summer thirty-eight participants with Type 1 Diabetes crossedthe Samaria gorge, the 2nd largest gorge in Europe (17_km). Twenty subjects onCSII combined with real-time CGMS and eighteen on Multiple Daily Injections (MDI)combined with professional (retrospective) CGMS participated in the program. All participants were unsupervised during the event.Results: All 38 participants managed to reach the destination point safely. Therewere no episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The duration of the exercise (mean ±SD) was 6.4±1.3_hours. The CSII group exhibited significantly lower hypoglycemicepisodes during exercise (0.1±0.3 vs 0.4±0.6; P_=_0.047) as well as lower AUCbelow 70_mg/dl compared to the MDI, during the 24_hours (0.61±0.78 vs1.84±1.55;P_=_0.007). Individuals on CSII were significantly less likely to develop ahypoglycemic episode during exercise (P_=_0.038). Exercise induced nocturnalhypoglycemia was not prevented effectively in neither group.Conclusions: CSII combined with CGMS is effective in controlling blood glucoselevels in Type 1 Diabetics who perform prolonged strenuous exercise. The use ofinsulin pump technology in regions with hot Mediterranean climates is safe andcan provide protection against exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Development ofprecise instructions for T1DM who occasionally get involved in exerciseactivities, requires further studies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sudomotor dysfunction independently predicts incident cardiovascular-renal events and all-cause death in type 2 diabetes: the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation register.,/pubmed/29939305,"Background: Early detection and risk factor control prevent chronic kidneydisease (CKD) progression. Evaluation of peripheral autonomic dysfunction maydetect incident cardiovascular-renal events in type 2 diabetes (T2D).Methods: SUDOSCAN, a non-invasive tool, provides an age-adjusted electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) composite score incorporating hands/feet ESC measurements,with a score_²53 indicating sudomotor dysfunction. A consecutive cohort of 2833Chinese adults underwent structured diabetes assessment in 2012-13; 2028participants without preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD weremonitored for incident cardiovascular-renal events until 2015.Results: In this prospective cohort {mean age 57.0 [standard deviation (SD) 10.0]years; median T2D duration 7.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.0-13.0] years; 56.1% men; 72.5% never-smokers; baseline ESC composite score 60.7 (SD 14.5)}, 163(8.0%) and 25 (1.2%) participants developed incident CKD and CVD, respectively,after 2.3_years of follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) per 1-unitdecrease in the ESC composite score for incident CKD, CVD and all-cause deathwere 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.04], 1.04 (1.00-1.07) and 1.04(1.00-1.08), respectively. Compared with participants with an ESC compositescore_>53, those with a score_²53 had an aHR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.09-2.23) for CKDand 3.11 (95% CI 1.27-7.62) for CVD, independent of common risk markers. Whenadded to clinical variables (sex and duration of diabetes), the ESC compositescore improved discrimination of all outcomes with appropriate reclassificationof CKD risk.Conclusions: A low ESC composite score independently predicts incidentcardiovascular-renal events and death in T2D, which may improve the screeningstrategy for early intervention.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pea Ferritin Stability under Gastric pH Conditions Determines the Mechanism of Iron Uptake in Caco-2 Cells.,/pubmed/29939292,"Background: Iron deficiency is an enduring global health problem that requiresnew remedial approaches. Iron absorption from soybean-derived ferritin, an_550-kDa iron storage protein, is comparable to bioavailable ferrous sulfate(FeSO4). However, the absorption of ferritin is reported to involve an endocytic mechanism, independent of divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT-1), thetransporter for nonheme iron.Objective: Our overall aim was to examine the potential of purified ferritin frompeas (Pisum sativum) as a food supplement by measuring its stability undergastric pH treatment and the mechanisms of iron uptake into Caco-2 cells.Methods: Caco-2 cells were treated with native or gastric pH-treated pea ferritinin combination with dietary modulators of nonheme iron uptake, small interfering RNA targeting DMT-1, or chemical inhibitors of endocytosis. Cellular ferritinformation, a surrogate measure of iron uptake, and internalization of peaferritin with the use of specific antibodies were measured. The production ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to equimolar concentrations of nativepea ferritin and FeSO4 was also compared.Results: Pea ferritin exposed to gastric pH treatment was degraded, and thereleased iron was transported into Caco-2 cells by DMT-1. Inhibitors of DMT-1 andnonheme iron absorption reduced iron uptake by 26-40%. Conversely, in the absenceof gastric pH treatment, the iron uptake of native pea ferritin was unaffected byinhibitors of nonheme iron absorption, and the protein was observed to beinternalized in Caco-2 cells. Chlorpromazine (clathrin-mediated endocytosisinhibitor) reduced the native pea ferritin content within cells by _30%, whichconfirmed that the native pea ferritin was transported into cells via aclathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. In addition, 60% less ROS productionresulted from native pea ferritin in comparison to FeSO4.Conclusion: With consideration that nonheme dietary inhibitors display no effect on iron uptake and the low oxidative potential relative to FeSO4, intact peaferritin appears to be a promising iron supplement.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Interleukin-1 Antagonism in Men with Metabolic Syndrome and Low Testosterone - A Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29939279,"Context: Hypogonadism is highly prevalent among obese men with metabolicsyndrome. Chronic low-grade inflammation is suspected to be a major cause for lowtestosterone levels in obese individuals.Objectives: To test the inflammatory hypothesis of testosterone deficiency inmetabolic syndrome.Design, Setting, Participants and Intervention: In this randomized,placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving men with metabolic syndrome, we randomly assigned 33 patients to receive 100 mg of anakinra (recombinant humaninterleukin-1-receptor antagonist) subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks and 34 patients to receive placebo.Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in totaltestosterone levels after 4 weeks.Results: The mean age was 54 years and baseline total testosterone levels were9.3 nmol/L (95%CI, 8.7-10.0). At 4 weeks, total testosterone levels increased by 1.2 nmol/L (95%CI, 0.3-2.0; P=0.01) in the anakinra group as compared to nochange in the placebo group (0.01 nmol/L; 95%CI, (-0.5)-0.5; P=0.99), resultingin a between-group difference of 0.96 nmol/L (95%CI, 0.3-1.9; P=0.04). Theeffects were most pronounced with baseline c-reactive protein >2 mg/L(between-group-difference 2.14 nmol/L; 95%CI, 0.11-4.17; P=0.04) and body massindex >40 kg/m2 (between-group-difference 2.64 nmol/L; 95%CI, 0.19-5.09; P=0.04).Anakinra treatment did not exert benefits on fatigue and sexual dysfunction, but improved grip strength of non-dominant hand by 3.5 kg (95%CI 0.23-6.81; P=0.04)and reduced mean arterial blood pressure by 2.9 mmHg (95%CI, (-5.99)-0.19;P=0.07).Conclusions: Antiinflammatory treatment with an antagonist of Interleukin-1 ledto a modest increase in testosterone levels in obese men with testosteronedeficiency.",RCT,,,,Anakinra,Placebo,,,Men with metabolic syndrome,Change from baseline in total testosterone levels,
Pregnancy complications following fertility treatment-disentangling the role of multiple gestation.,/pubmed/29939263,"Background: To assess the extent to which multiple gestations mediate risk ofpregnancy complications from fertility treatment and to address possibleconfounding by the underlying infertility.Methods: From the nearly 1.8 million pregnancies recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register between 1996 and 2013, we selected the 9.9% (N_=_174Ê067) thatoccurred to couples with known trouble conceiving (clinical infertility).Fertility treatment was identified from self-reports, medical records andprocedural information from fertility clinics. We used logistic regression toestimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), anddecomposed the total effect into direct and mediated effects to estimate theproportion mediated by multiple gestations.Results: Compared with pregnancies achieved without any assistance, those having received some treatment had higher odds of all studied complications exceptgestational diabetes. Associations with placenta previa (OR 2.17, 95% CI1.95-2.40) and placental abruption (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.54-2.03) were almostentirely independent of multiple gestations. In contrast, the majority of theassociations with preterm birth (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.62-1.77), caesarean delivery(RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17) and pre-eclampsia (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.22) weremediated by multiple gestations (87%, 62% and 91% of the effect mediated,respectively). Both direct and mediated pathways contributed to the remainingpositive associations with chorioamnionitis, labour induction and postpartumhaemorrhage. Results were similar when considering primi- and multi-parous women separately, and after restriction to assisted reproductive technologies only.Conclusion: Multiple gestations are responsible for a large proportion ofpregnancy complications associated with fertility treatment, suggesting thatinterventions to restrict the occurrence of multiples could reduce excess risk ofpre-eclampsia, preterm birth and caesarean delivery after fertility treatment.However, the elevated risk of serious placental complications after fertilitytreatment appears to be largely independent of multiple gestations.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Depressive Symptoms and their Relation to Age and Chronic diseases among middle-aged and Older Adults in rural South Africa.,/pubmed/29939214,"Background: Understanding how depression is associated with chronic conditionsand socio-demographic characteristics can inform the design and effectivetargeting of depression screening and care interventions. In this study, wepresent some of the first evidence from sub-Saharan Africa on the associationbetween depressive symptoms and a range of chronic conditions (diabetes, HIV,hypertension, and obesity) as well as socio-demographic characteristics.Methods: A questionnaire was administered to a population-based simple randomsample of 5,059 adults aged 40 years in Agincourt, South Africa. Depressivesymptoms were measured using a modified version of the eight-item Center forEpidemiological Studies Depression screening tool. Diabetes was assessed using a capillary blood glucose measurement and HIV using a dried blood spot.Results: 17.0% (95% CI: 15.9% - 18.1%) of participants had at least threedepressive symptoms. None of the chronic conditions were significantly associatedwith depressive symptoms in multivariable regressions. Older age was thestrongest correlate of depressive symptoms with those aged 80 years and olderhaving on average 0.63 (95% CI: 0.40 - 0.86; p<0.001) more depressive symptomsthan those aged 40-49 years. Household wealth quintile and education were notsignificant correlates.Conclusions: This study provides some evidence that the positive associations of depression with diabetes, HIV, hypertension, and obesity that are commonlyreported in high-income settings might not exist in rural South Africa. Ourfinding that increasing age is strongly associated with depressive symptomssuggests that there is a particularly high need for depression screening andtreatment among the elderly in rural South Africa.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The TreadWheel: Interval Training Protocol for Gently Induced Exercise in Drosophila melanogaster.,/pubmed/29939171,"The incidence of complex metabolic diseases has increased as a result of awidespread transition towards lifestyles of increased caloric intake and lowered activity levels. These multifactorial diseases arise from a combination ofgenetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. One such complex disease isMetabolic Syndrome (MetS), which is a cluster of metabolic disorders, includinghypertension, hyperglycemia, and abdominal obesity. Exercise and dietaryintervention are the primary treatments recommended by doctors to mitigateobesity and its subsequent metabolic diseases. Exercise intervention, inparticular aerobic interval training, stimulates favorable changes in the common risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD),and other conditions. With the influx of evidence describing the therapeuticeffect exercise has on metabolic health, establishing a system that modelsexercise in a controlled setting provides a valuable tool for assessing theeffects of exercise in an experimental context. Drosophila melanogaster is agreat tool for investigating the physiological and molecular changes that result from exercise intervention. The flies have short lifespans and similar mechanismsof metabolizing nutrients when compared to humans. To induce exercise inDrosophila, we developed a machine called the TreadWheel, which utilizes thefly's innate, negative geotaxis tendency to gently induce climbing. This enables researchers to perform experiments on large cohorts of genetically diverse flies to better understand the genotype-by-environment interactions underlying theeffects of exercise on metabolic health.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in adolescents and adults with congenital heart disease.,/pubmed/29938932,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD) may be at higher risk of acquired cardiovascular disease than the general population due to theirunderlying physiology and/or surgical sequelae. We sought to assess theprevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in youth and adults with CHD.METHODS: We assessed cardiovascular health as per the Cardiovascular Health inAmbulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) health index in patients with CHD aged15+ years who attended cardiology outpatient clinics. Participants self-reported smoking behavior, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and whetherthey had diabetes and hypertension. Individual health indices were categorizedinto ideal/not ideal, and sum of individual health indices was categorized aspoor, intermediate or ideal cardiovascular health as per CANHEART criteria.RESULTS: We included n_=_102 adults (35.4_±_12.9 years, 46% female) and n_=_88youth (17.2 ±1.1 years, 41% female). Most individuals reported to be nonsmokers(88% youth vs 86% adults) and to consume ³5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day (83% vs 85%, respectively). More adults than youth were overweight/obese (52%vs 22%, p_<_0.001) though more adults than youth reported meeting age-specificphysical activity guidelines (84% vs 55%, p_<_0.001). According to CANHEARThealth index criteria, 32% of youth and 27% of adults were in idealcardiovascular health.CONCLUSIONS: A low proportion of individuals with CHD are in ideal cardiovascularhealth, suggesting a need to promote healthy lifestyles during adolescence andthroughout adulthood in these individuals.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A population-representative analysis of dietary supplementation among Americans with diabetes mellitus.,/pubmed/29938914,"BACKGROUND: Few population-representative studies have examined dietarysupplement use among Americans with diabetes mellitus (DM). This investigationanalyzed dietary supplementation and DM data from the 2013-2014 National Healthand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).METHODS: Data from 5,040 adult participants were analyzed, including 639participants reporting a diagnosis of DM (Method 1), which increased to 1,036after including participants reporting ""borderline"" DM or prediabetes (Method 2).Participants reported dietary supplements used over the past month. Prevalence ofsupplementation was compared among participants with and without DM using theRao-Scott likelihood chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression wasused to examine if DM was an independent predictor of supplementation.RESULTS: Regardless of whether Method 1 or Method 2 was used, dietarysupplementation was more prevalent among participants with DM (Method 1, 61.4%vs. 54.4%, P = 0.024; Method 2, 62.7% vs. 53.5%, P < 0.001). After adjusting for a variety of demographic and health-related variables, the presence of DM was no longer associated with supplementation for Method 1 (odds ratio = 1.01, 95% CI,0.78-1.32; P = 0.925) or Method 2 (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI, 0.91-1.41; P =0.238). Approximately four out of every five products taken for the purpose ofmanaging DM were self-prescribed, the most common being multi-vitamins-minerals, cinnamon-containing supplements, and chromium-containing supplements.CONCLUSION: Slightly more than 6 out of 10 Americans with DM use dietarysupplements each month, and although this is higher than Americans without DM, itdoesn't appear to be due to DM per se.

Clinical outcomes in real-world patients with type 2 diabetes switching from first- to second-generation basal insulin analogues: Comparative effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 units/mL and insulin degludec in the DELIVER D+ cohort study.,/pubmed/29938887,"AIMS: To compare clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D)switching from insulin glargine 100_units/mL (Gla-100) or insulin detemir (IDet) to insulin glargine 300_units/mL (Gla-300) or insulin degludec (IDeg).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study ofelectronic medical records for Gla-300/IDeg adult switchers (March 1, 2015 toJanuary 31, 2017) with active records for 12-month baseline (glycated haemoglobin[HbA1c] used a 6-month baseline period) and 6-month follow-up periods. Gla-300and IDeg switchers were propensity score-matched using baseline demographic andclinical characteristics. Outcomes were HbA1c change and goal attainment (amongpatients with HbA1c captured at follow-up), and hypoglycaemia with fixedfollow-up (intention-to-treat [ITT]; 6_months) and variable follow-up(on-treatment [OT]; to discontinuation or 6_months).RESULTS: Each matched cohort comprised 1592 patients. The mean decrease in HbA1c and HbA1c goal (<7.0% [53 mmol/mol] and <8.0% [64 mmol/mol]) attainment rateswere similar for Gla-300 (n_=_742) and IDeg (n_=_727) switchers. Using fixedfollow-up (ITT method), hypoglycaemia incidence decreased significantly frombaseline with Gla-300 (all hypoglycaemia: 15.6% to 12.7%; P_=_.006; hypoglycaemiaassociated with inpatient/emergency department [ED] encounter: 5.3% to 3.5%;P_=_.007), but not with IDeg.

Using variable follow-up (OT), hypoglycaemiaincidence was similar in both groups, but Gla-300 switchers had a lowerinpatient/ED hypoglycaemia event rate at follow-up (adjusted rate ratio 0.56;P_=_.016).CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, switching from Gla-100 or IDet to Gla-300or IDeg was associated with similar improvements in glycaemic control andhypoglycaemia in adult patients with T2D.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Running on mixed fuel-dual agonistic approach of GLP-1 and GCG receptors leads to beneficial impact on body weight and blood glucose control: A comparative study between mice and non-human primates.,/pubmed/29938884,"AIM: We performed acute and chronic studies in healthy and diet-induced obeseanimals using mouse-specific or monkey-specific dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonists toinvestigate their effects on food intake, body weight, blood glucose control and insulin secretion. The selective GLP-1R agonist liraglutide was used ascomparator.METHODS: The mouse-specific dual agonist and liraglutide were tested in lean wildtype, GLP-1R knockout and diet-induced obese mice at different doses. A chronicstudy was performed in DIO mice to investigate the effect on body weight, foodconsumption and total energy expenditure (TEE) in obese and diabetic monkeys witha focus on body weight and energy intake.RESULTS: The mouse-specific dual agonist and liraglutide similarly affectedglycaemic control. A higher loss in body weight was measured in dualagonist-treated obese mice. The dual agonist significantly enhanced plasmaglucose excursion in overnight fed GLP-1R-/- mice, probably reflecting a potentGCGR agonist activity. It increased TEE and enhanced fat and carbohydrateoxidation, while liraglutide produced no effect on TEE. In obese and diabeticmonkeys, treatment with the monkey-specific dual agonist reduced total energyintake to 60%-70% of baseline TEI during chronic treatment. A decrease in bodyweight and significant improvement in glucose tolerance was observed.CONCLUSIONS: In DIO mice and non-human primates, dual agonists elicited robustglycaemic control, similar to the marketed GLP-1R agonist, while elicitinggreater effects on body weight. Results from DIO mice suggest that the increasein TEE is caused not only by increased fat oxidation but also by an increase incarbohydrate oxidation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparative effectiveness of canagliflozin, SGLT2 inhibitors and non-SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A real-world meta-analysis of 4 observational databases (OBSERVE-4D).",/pubmed/29938883,"AIMS: Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are indicated fortreatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); some SGLT2i have reportedcardiovascular benefit, and some have reported risk of below-knee lower extremity(BKLE) amputation. This study examined the real-world comparative effectivenesswithin the SGLT2i class and compared with non-SGLT2i antihyperglycaemic agents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 4 large US administrative claims databases were used to characterize risk and provide population-level estimates ofcanagliflozin's effects on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and BKLEamputation vs other SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i in T2DM patients. Comparative analyses using a propensity score-adjusted new-user cohort design examined relativehazards of outcomes across all new users and a subpopulation with establishedcardiovascular disease.RESULTS: Across the 4 databases (142_800 new users of canagliflozin, 110_897 new users of other SGLT2i, 460_885 new users of non-SGLT2i), the meta-analytic hazardratio estimate for HHF with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.39 (95% CI,0.26-0.60) in the on-treatment analysis. The estimate for BKLE amputation withcanagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.40-1.41) in the on-treatmentanalysis and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.10) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Effects inthe subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease were similar for bothoutcomes. No consistent differences were observed between canagliflozin and otherSGLT2i.CONCLUSIONS: In this large comprehensive analysis, canagliflozin and other SGLT2idemonstrated HHF benefits consistent with clinical trial data, but showed noincreased risk of BKLE amputation vs non-SGLT2i. HHF and BKLE amputation results were similar in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. Thisstudy helps further characterize the potential benefits and harms of SGLT2i inroutine clinical practice to complement evidence from clinical trials and priorobservational studies.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Association of ADHD with recurrent hypoglycemia in type 1 DM.,/pubmed/29938875,"OBJECTIVE: Data regarding the association between hypoglycemia and attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents with type 1diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are limited.

Association of QRS-T angle and heart rate variability with major cardiac events and mortality in hemodialysis patients.,/pubmed/29938866,"INTRODUCTION: Mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients is high with significantproportion attributed to fatal arrhythmias. In a pilot study, we showed thatintradialytic electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring can yield stable profiles of selected repolarisation descriptors and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. This study investigated the relationship of these ECG markers with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mortality.METHODS: Continuous ECGs were obtained during HD and repeated five times at2-week intervals. The QRS-T angle calculated as Total Cosine R to T (TCRT) andT-wave morphology dispersion (TMD) were calculated in overlapping 10Ês ECGsegments. High- (HF) and low (LF)-frequency components and the LF/HF ratio of HRVwere calculated every 5Êmin. These indices were averaged during the first hour ofdialysis and subsequently overall recordings in each subject.RESULTS: All ECG parameters were available in 72 patients aged 61Ê±Ê15, 23(31.9%) females and 26 (36.1%) diabetics. After a median follow up of54.8Êmonths, 16 patients died, 20 were transplanted, and 9 suffered MACE. TCRT(in degrees) was higher and LF/HF was lower in patients who died compared tosurvivors (112Ê±Ê30 vs. 73Ê±Ê35, pÊ=Ê0.000 and 0.222Ê±Ê0.418 vs. 0.401Ê±Ê0.274,pÊ=Ê0.000, respectively) and in MACE positive compared to negative (117Ê±Ê40 vs. 77Ê±Ê34, pÊ=Ê0.017 and 0.125Ê±Ê0.333 vs.0.401Ê±Ê0.274, pÊ=Ê0.007 respectively).In multivariate Cox regression analysis of mortality risk adjusted for age,diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, TCRT and LF/HF remainedsignificant predictors (pÊ<Ê0.05).CONCLUSION: QRS-T angle and HRV may serve risk assessment in future prospectivestudies in HD patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of the treatment period, glucose data wereanalysed and integrated with baseline metabolic and anthropomorphic variables.RESULTS: Some 15/16 (94%) women exhibited elevated glucose levels(>Ê11.1Êmmol/l). Peak glucose levels were highest on the day of treatment (median14.45Êmmol/l, range 10.2-22.2Êmmol/l) and total time spent with an elevatedinterstitial glucose level was highly variable (median 3.6Êh, range 0.0-55.1Êh). Peak interstitial glucose levels occurred predominantly, but not exclusively, in the afternoon (13.00-15.00) and evening (19.00-22.00); however, elevated levelswere noted throughout the 24-h period. Baseline HbA1c was independentlyassociated with severity and duration of elevated glucose levels in a regression adjusted for baseline BMI.CONCLUSIONS: These data report for the first time that high glucose levels areencountered by nearly all women following this regimen, the severity and durationof which are independently associated with HbA1c . Further work is required todetermine if controlling glucose levels during treatment influences outcome. Thisarticle is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Protein hydrolysates and ultrafiltered fractions (<1kDa) from Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris and Mucuna pruriens exhibit antihyperglycemic activity, intestinal glucose absorption and ë±-glucosidase inhibition with no acute toxicity in rodents.",/pubmed/29938798,"BACKGROUND: Protein hydrolysates from food plants, such as legumes, have emerged as a new alternative to treat hyperglycemia, an important risk factorcontributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and itscomplications. The aim of this work was to assess antihyperglycemic activity,inhibition of _-glucosidase and intestinal glucose absorption, and acute toxicityof total hydrolysates and <1kDa fractions from Phaseolus lunatus L., Phaseolusvulgaris L. and Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., obtained by hydrolysis with Alcalase¨-Flavourzyme¨ or pepsine-pancreatin enzymatic systems.RESULTS: In vivo results showed that three of six total hydrolysates and four of six <1kDa fractions suppressed starch induced-postprandial hyperglycemia (ED50range between 1.4 and 93 mg kg-1 ). While in vitro, total hydrolysates andfractions, particularly from M. pruriens, inhibited carbohydrate intestinalabsorption (19.2 to 40%), and _-glucosidase activity (IC50 from 0.86 to 75 mgmL-1 ). Finally, all of the hydrolysates and fractions tested did not show anysigns of toxicity (LD50 >5000 mg kg-1 ).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that hydrolysates and <1kDa fractions from P.lunatus, P. vulgaris and mainly M. pruriens are suitable candidates to treat orprevent T2DM.

Nutrition and Nutraceuticals in Neuroinflammatory and Brain Metabolic Stress: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,/pubmed/29938622,"A steep rise in the incidences of neurodegenerative disorders could be thecombined effect of several non-genetic factors such as increased life expectancy,environmental pollutants, lifestyle, and dietary habits, as the population-level genetic change would require multiple generations. Emerging evidence demonstratesthat chronic over-nutrition induces brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation,and both are individually known to promote neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD).Although the association of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension,dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis with the dietary habits is well known, theunderstanding of neuronal implications of diet and nutritional supplements isstill in the infancy. Transcriptomics and proteomics-based studies support theview that nutraceuticals target multiple neuroprotective pathways in a slow butmore physiological manner without causing severe adverse effects, and mayrepresent the future of tackling neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, i)we review the diet/dietary supplement connection with the brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation and ii) summarize the current advancements on the effectsof nutraceuticals on the neurodegenerative disorders.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Diabetes in menopause: risks and management.,/pubmed/29938620,"The aim of this review is to present, critically appraise and qualitativelysynthesize current evidence on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)development during menopause, the management of climacteric symptoms in womenwith T2DM and the management of T2DM in postmenopausal women. Menopauserepresents the end of reproductive life in women, as a result of ovarian aging.It is characterized by substantial decrease in the endogenous oestrogenconcentrations and it is accompanied by alterations in body weight, adiposetissue distribution and energy expenditure, as well as insulin secretion, insulinsensitivity and activity that can predispose to the development of T2DM,independently of, and additively to, aging. Many women in midlife experienceclimacteric symptoms, including hot flushes and night sweats, resulting in anindication to receive Hormone Replacement Treatment (HRT). HRT has a favourableeffect on glucose homeostasis both in women without and with T2DM. The latter wasconsidered in the past as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) equivalent, which would suggest that women with the disease should not receive HRT. However, nowadaysevidence exists to support an individualized approach of women based on their CVDrisk, as some women with T2DM may be excellent candidates for HRT. Regarding T2DMmanagement for women in menopause, lifestyle intervention, including diet andexercise, constitutes its cornerstone. However, most of these women willeventually require pharmacologic therapy. The most suitable agents should beselected according to their metabolic, cardiovascular and bone effects, takinginto consideration the specific characteristics and comorbidities of eachpostmenopausal woman.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Coronary microvascular and cardiac dysfunction due to homocysteine pathometabolism; a complex therapeutic design.,/pubmed/29938610,"In various metabolic diseases both the coronary circulation and cardiacmetabolism are altered. Here we summarize the effects of a condition calledhyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) - which can develop due to genetic or environmentalcauses - on the function of coronary microvessels and heart. This metabolicdisease is underappreciated, yet even mild or moderate elevation of plasmaconcentrations of homocystein (Hcy, plasma Hcy >16 _M), a sulfur-containing aminoacid produced via methionine metabolism) leads to coronary and peripheral artery and even venous vessel diseases, leading to vasomotor dysfunction and increasedthrombosis, consequently increased morbidity and mortality. Yet the underlyingmechanisms are not yet revealed. Recent studies indicated that there are commonpathomechanisms, which may affect all cellular function involved. Two mainmechanisms are the dysfunction of nitric oxide (NO) pathway resulting reduceddilator responses of arteries and arterioles with methionine diet-inducedhyperhomocysteinemia, and the simultaneously increased thromboxane A2 (TXA2)activity both in vessels and platelets. These changes are likely due to anincreased production of reactive oxidative species (oxidative stress) due toincreased NADPH oxidase assembly, which eventually lead to inflammatory process(indicated by increases in TNF_, NF_beta, p22phox, p67phox, and rac-1, levels)and changes in various gene expressions and morphological remodeling of vessels. Increased superoxide production and reduced ability of NO alters the regulationof mitochondrial function in the myocardium. The interactions of thesepathomechanisms may explain why HHcy increases the uptake of glucose and lactate and decreases the uptake of free fatty acid by the heart. The pathologicalconsequences of HHcy could be worsening by the simultaneous presence of otherrisk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.All in all, HHcy and associated pathometabolism lead to severe changes anddysfunctions of coronary arterial vessels and cardiac function, which may notalways apparent in clinical settings but most likely, contribute to increasedprevalence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, which however can be reducedby appropriate prevention and treatments. We believe that HHcy is anunderestimated - likely due to inappropriate clinical trials - but seriousdisease condition because it promotes the development of atherosclerosis in largearterial vessels, vasomotor dysfunction in microvessels, hypertension andthrombosis. In this review we will summarizes previous functional findingsfocusing on coronary vessels and cardiac function and the underlying cellular andmolecular mechanisms enabling the development of novel treatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition enhances the glucoregulatory properties of exercise in type 2 diabetes patients.,/pubmed/29938604,"AIMS: Exercise combined with adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition augmentsintramuscular lipid and glycogen use in type 2 diabetes patients. The presentstudy investigates the impact of adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition duringexercise on subsequent postprandial glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.METHODS: Fourteen male type 2 diabetes patients (age 65_±_2 years, HbA1c6.7_±_0.1% (50_±_2_mmol/mol)) participated in a double-blind placebo-controlledrandomized cross-over study in which subjects performed endurance-type exerciseafter being administered 250_mg of a nicotinic acid analogue (acipimox; ACP) or aplacebo (PLA). A control experiment was included in which no exercise wasperformed (CON).RESULTS: Sixty minutes of endurance-type exercise (at 45% Wpeak) did notsignificantly lower circulating plasma glucose and insulin excursions in PLA whencompared with CON (P_=_.300). Acipimox administration strongly reducedcirculating plasma FFA concentrations during exercise (P_<_.001).

Optimal Starting Age for Colorectal Cancer Screening in an Era of Increased Metabolic Unhealthiness: A Nationwide Korean Cross-Sectional Study.,/pubmed/29938455,"Background/Aim: The association between metabolic syndrome and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suggested as one of causes for the increasing incidence of CRC,particularly in younger age groups. The present study examined whether thecurrent age threshold (50 years) for CRC screening in Korea requires modificationwhen considering increased metabolic syndrome.Methods: We analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Corporationdatabase, which covers ~97% of the population in Korea. CRC risk was stratifiedaccording to age and the presence or absence of relevant metabolic syndromecomponents (diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension).Results: A total of 51,612,316 subjects enrolled during 2014 to 2015 wereanalyzed. Among them, 19.3% had diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or somecombination thereof. This population had a higher incidence of CRC than did thosewithout these conditions, and this was more prominent in subjects _40 years ofage. The optimal cutoff age for detecting CRC, based on the highest Youden index,was 45 years among individuals without diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although individuals with at least one of these components of metabolic syndrome had the highest Youden index at 62 years old, the value was only 0.2. Resettingthe cutoff age from 50 years to 45 years achieved a 6% increase in sensitivityfor CRC detection among the total population.Conclusions: Starting CRC screening earlier, namely, at 45 rather than at 50years of age, may improve secondary prevention of CRC in Korea.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Possible association of the TERT promoter polymorphisms rs2735940, rs7712562 and rs2853669 with diabetes mellitus in obese elderly Polish population: results from the national PolSenior study.",/pubmed/29938393,"One of the markers of aging is lymphocyte telomere length (LTL), which isaffected by genetic constitution of the organism and environmental conditions,such as development and diseases, including diabetes. The relationship of thelater seems to be bilateral. The enzyme responsible for the maintenance oftelomere length is a subunit of telomerase-telomerase reverse transcriptase(TERT). The aims of the present study were to (1) determine the influence of the TERT promoter sequence SNP variants on relative telomere length (RTL) in anelderly Polish population and (2) explore the potential associations of the SNPs with the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the obese individuals. Two highlyhomogenous subgroups of PolSenior participants were investigated, the firstconstituted 70 relatively healthy respondents and the second 70 individuals with T2DM. Telomere length ratio (T/S value) was measured; 1.5Êkb part upstream of thetranscription start site of the TERT promoter was sequenced, and the frequencies of polymorphisms were calculated and compared against analysed data.Low-frequency SNPs were evaluated but excluded from further comparative analyses to RTL and glucose metabolism markers. No significant difference in telomerelength was found between the two studied subgroups. Univariate statisticalanalyses showed only a weak association of environmental or genetic factorsaltering this marker of aging. Approximate frequency of four SNPs in TERTpromoter sequence was assessed in Polish population aged 65-95Êyears, but threeof them (rs2735940, rs7712562 and rs2853669) were selected for further analyses. The SNP selection was based on their minor allele frequencies in generalpopulation and on published data. The univariate analysis has revealed thatcarriers of CC SNP (rs2853669) have had the shortest RTL in the T2DM group.Multivariate analysis has also revealed that the genetic effect of TERT promoter CC SNP was strengthened by the incidence of T2DM. The additional variation in RTLin paired groups indicates that in addition to T2DM and genetics, there are otherfactors contributing to development of the age-related diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Community Needs Assessment of Urban Utah American Indians and Alaska Natives.,/pubmed/29938368,"The needs of Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are oftennot well understood. In order to inform programs and services, the Urban IndianCenter of Salt Lake (UIC-SL), in cooperation with researchers from the Universityof Utah, undertook a community needs assessment of AI/AN living along Utah'sWasatch Front. A 60-item questionnaire was developed to capture information abouthealth status, services used, unmet needs, and common sources of informationabout AI/AN community events and activities. Study participants (n_=_336) were a convenience sample. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation,percentage, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. The most common healthprovider diagnosed medical conditions included hypertension, obesity, anddiabetes. The prevalence of violence, substance abuse, and mental healthconditions were also high among study participants and their families. Comparedto the general Utah population, study participants experienced disparitiesrelative to diabetes prevalence, cognitive and visual disabilities, and access tohealth care. In addition to health care services, respondents indicated a needfor cultural, social, and educational programs. They also reported high levels oftechnology use, suggesting a possible avenue for communicating with thispopulation. This community-based participatory research project provided richinformation about the unmet needs of this urban AI/AN population.

Shared Genetic Contribution of Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: Implications for Prognosis and Treatment.,/pubmed/29938349,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in subjectswith type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well established. This review collates theavailable evidence and assesses the shared genetic background between T2D andCVD: the causal contribution of common risk factors to T2D and CVD and howgenetics can be used to improve drug development and clinical outcomes.RECENT FINDINGS: Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T2D andCVD support a shared genetic background but minimal individual locus overlap.Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses show that T2D is causal for CVD, but GWASof CVD, T2D and their common risk factors provided limited evidence forindividual locus overlap. Distinct but functionally related pathways wereenriched for CVD and T2D genetic associations reflecting the lack of locusoverlap and providing some explanation for the variable associations of commonrisk factors with CVD and T2D from MR analyses.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Interrogation of a longitudinal, national pharmacy claims dataset to explore factors that predict the need for add-on therapy in older and socioeconomically disadvantaged Australians with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T2DM).",/pubmed/29938343,"PURPOSE: The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex. The aim ofthis work is to explore factors that predict the need for add-on therapy inpatients with T2DM in the community.METHODS: We accessed longitudinal, pharmacy payment claim records from thenational Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (Subsidises costs of medicines:government pays difference between patient co-payments, lower in concessionalpatients, and additional cost of drug.) for the period January 2006 to September 2014 (EREC/MI3127) from a 10% random sample of the Australian populationvalidated to be representative of the population by the Australian Bureau ofStatistics (ABS). Likely, T2DM patients were identified as those having beendispensed a single anti-hyperglycaemic drug (monotherapy). The time taken andpossible factors that might lead to the addition of a second therapy wereexamined. An examination was made of trends in the co-prescription of eitherantihypertensive or anti-hyperlipidaemic agents in relation to the time(±_3Êyears) of initiating an anti-hyperglycaemic agent.RESULTS: Most (83%) presumed T2DM patients were initiated with metformin. Theaverage time until the second agent was added was 4.8Êyears (95% CI 4.7-4.9).Satisfactory adherence, age, male gender, initiating therapy after 2012 andinitiating with a sulphonylurea drug all were significant risks for add-ontherapy. There was no overall trend in the initiation of antihypertensive and/or anti-hyperlipidaemic agents with respect to the time of anti-hyperglycaemicinitiation.CONCLUSION: The usefulness of a longitudinal dataset of pharmacy-claim records isdemonstrated. Over half of all older and socioeconmically disadvantaged T2DMpatients captured in this longitudinal claims database will be prescribed asecond anti-hyperglycaemic agent within 5Êyears of their first drug therapy.Several factors can predict the risk of prescription of add-on therapy, and theseshould be considered when prescribing medications to treat T2DM.",N,,,,,,,,,,
HMGA1a Induces Alternative Splicing of the Estrogen Receptor-ë±lpha Gene by Trapping U1 snRNP to an Upstream Pseudo-5' Splice Site.,/pubmed/29938207,"bjectives: The high-mobility group A protein 1a (HMGA1a) protein is known as atranscription factor that binds to DNA, but recent studies have shown it exertsnovel functions through RNA-binding. We were prompted to decipher the mechanismof HMGA1a-induced alternative splicing of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER_) that we recently reported would alter tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 TAMR1 cells.Methods: Endogenous expression of full length ER_66 and its isoform ER_46 wereevaluated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by transient expression of HMGA1a and anRNA decoy (2'-O-methylated RNA of the HMGA1a RNA-binding site) that binds toHMGA1a. RNA-binding of HMGA1a was checked by RNA-EMSA. In vitro splicing assaywas performed to check the direct involvement of HMGA1a in splicing regulation.RNA-EMSA assay in the presence of purified U1 snRNP was performed with psoralenUV crosslinking to check complex formation of HMGA1a-U1 snRNP at the upstreampseudo-5' splice site of exon 1. Results: HMGA1a induced exon skipping of ashortened exon 1 of ER_ in in vitro splicing assays that was blocked by theHMGA1a RNA decoy and sequence-specific RNA-binding was confirmed by RNA-EMSA.RNA-EMSA combined with psoralen UV crosslinking showed that HMGA1a trappedpurified U1 snRNP at the upstream pseudo-5' splice site. Conclusions: Regulation of ER_ alternative splicing by an HMGA1a-trapped U1 snRNP complex at the upstream5' splice site of exon 1 offers novel insight on 5' splice site regulation by U1 snRNP as well as a promising target in breast cancer therapy where alternativesplicing of ER_ is involved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis of the regulation pathways via microarray and miRNA studies: human embryonic stem cells to treat diabetes mellitus type-II.,/pubmed/29938125,"Diabetes mellitus occurs either due to an autoimmune destruction of _ cells (Type1) or resistance to insulin effects (Type 2).

In the present study, we use the microarray and miRNA studies to prove why hESCs are effective in diabetes. Three samples of hESCs were cultured andmicroarray technology was used for the analysis of diabetic pathways. The genetargets for miRNA were analyzed using gene ontology (GO) and DAVID database.Genes involved in the diabetic pathways were classified in accordance with GOanalysis. Pathways for these genes were determined using Reactome and Pantherdatabases. The up and down-regulation of all the genes involved were confirmedwith the significant p-values.

Discovery of a stem-like multipotent cell fate.,/pubmed/29938123,"Adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) can be obtained from lipoaspirates and induced in vitro to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat. Using this powerfulmodel system we show that after in vitro adipose differentiation a population of cells retain stem-like qualities including multipotency. They are lipid (-),retain the ability to propagate, express two known stem cell markers, andmaintain the capacity for trilineage differentiation into chondrocytes,adipocytes, and osteoblasts. However, these cells are not traditional stem cells because gene expression analysis showed an overall expression profile similar to that of adipocytes. In addition to broadening our understanding of cellularmultipotency, our work may be particularly relevant to obesity-associatedmetabolic disorders. The adipose expandability hypothesis proposes that inabilityto differentiate new adipocytes is a primary cause of metabolic syndrome inobesity, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here we have defined adifferentiation-resistant stem-like multipotent cell population that may beinvolved in regulation of adipose expandability in vivo and may therefore playkey roles in the comorbidities of obesity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Type 2 Diabetes Leads to Axon Initial Segment Shortening in db/db Mice.,/pubmed/29937715,"Cognitive and mood impairments are common central nervous system complications oftype 2 diabetes, although the neuronal mechanism(s) remains elusive. Previousstudies focused mainly on neuronal inputs such as altered synaptic plasticity.Axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized functional domain within neurons thatregulates neuronal outputs. Structural changes of AIS have been implicated as akey pathophysiological event in various psychiatric and neurological disorders.Here we evaluated the structural integrity of the AIS in brains of db/db mice, anestablished animal model of type 2 diabetes associated with cognitive and moodimpairments. We assessed the AIS before (5 weeks of age) and after (10 weeks) thedevelopment of type 2 diabetes, and after daily exercise treatment of diabeticcondition. We found that the development of type 2 diabetes is associated withsignificant AIS shortening in both medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, asevident by immunostaining of the AIS structural protein _IV spectrin. AISshortening occurs in the absence of altered neuronal and AIS protein levels. Wefound no change in nodes of Ranvier, another neuronal functional domain sharing amolecular organization similar to the AIS. This is the first study to identifyAIS alteration in type 2 diabetes condition. Since AIS shortening is known tolower neuronal excitability, our results may provide a new avenue forunderstanding and treating cognitive and mood impairments in type 2 diabetes.",N,,,,,,,,,,

These relationships may vary by country or race/ethnicity. Weaimed to systematically review studies in this field conducted with the Japanese population because such a review in the Japanese population has never beenundertaken.METHODS: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed and Ichushi-Webdatabases for studies published until December 2016. Studies comparing theincidence and/or prevalence of the comorbidities among the Japanese populationwere included. The studies were classified as integrated analyses, cohortstudies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies.RESULTS: We identified 33 studies (cancer: 17, periodontal disease: 5, fracture: 5, cognitive impairment: 4, and depression: 2). Although several cohort studiesand meta-analyses had assessed the development of cancer in diabetes, there wasscant epidemiological evidence for the other conditions. Indeed, only one cohort study each had been conducted for periodontal disease, fracture, and cognitiveimpairment, whereas other evidence was cross-sectional, some of which was inducedfrom baseline characteristic tables of studies designed for other purposes.CONCLUSION: In Japan, there is insufficient evidence about the relationshipbetween diabetes and the incidence/prevalence of periodontal disease, fracture,cognitive impairment, and depression. By contrast, several cohort studies andintegrated analyses have been conducted for the relationship with cancer. Furtherstudies should be undertaken to estimate the contribution of diabetes on theincidence/prevalence of comorbidities that may be specific to the Japanesepopulation.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Collateral Damage: Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Induced With Checkpoint Inhibitors.,/pubmed/29937434,"Insulin-dependent diabetes may occur in patients with cancers who are treatedwith checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). We reviewed cases occurring over a 6-yearperiod at two academic institutions and identified 27 patients in whom thisdeveloped, or an incidence of 0.9%. The patients had a variety of solid-organcancers, but all had received either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Diabetespresented with ketoacidosis in 59%, and 42% had evidence of pancreatitis in theperidiagnosis period. Forty percent had at least one positive autoantibody and21% had two or more. There was a predominance of HLA-DR4, which was present in76% of patients. Other immune adverse events were seen in 70%, and endocrineadverse events in 44%. We conclude that autoimmune, insulin-dependent diabetesoccurs in close to 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or -PD-L1 CPIs. Thissyndrome has similarities and differences compared with classic type 1 diabetes. The dominance of HLA-DR4 suggests an opportunity to identify those at highestrisk of these complications and to discover insights into the mechanisms of this adverse event.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Islet Long Noncoding RNAs: A Playbook for Discovery and Characterization.,/pubmed/29937433,"Diabetes is a complex group of metabolic disorders that can be accompanied byseveral comorbidities, including increased risk of early death. Decades ofdiabetes research have elucidated many genetic drivers of normal islet functionand dysfunction; however, a lack of suitable treatment options suggests ourknowledge about the disease remains incomplete. The establishment of longnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), once dismissed as ""junk"" DNA, as essential generegulators in many biological processes has redefined the central role for RNA incells. Studies showing that misregulation of lncRNAs can lead to disease havecontributed to the emergence of lncRNAs as attractive candidates for drugtargeting. These findings underscore the need to reexamine islet biology in thecontext of a regulatory role for RNA. This review will 1) highlight what is knownabout lncRNAs in the context of diabetes, 2) summarize the strategies used inlncRNA discovery pipelines, and 3) discuss future directions and the potentialimpact of studying the role of lncRNAs in diabetes.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of abdominal obesity measures in predicting of 10-year cardiovascular risk in an Iranian adult population using ACC/AHA risk model: A population based cross sectional study.,/pubmed/29937421,"BACKGROUND: Several abdominal obesity measures have been used for prediction of10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but the superiority of these measuresremains controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the predictiveability of abdominal obesity measures for risk of CVD events in an Iranian adult population.METHODS: We analyzed the data of population based cross-section study of 567representative samples of adult population aged 40-70 years in Babol, the northof Iran. The demographic data, the anthropometric measures, lipid profile andcardiometabolic risk factors were measured with standard methods. Waist to hipratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), conicity index(CI), abdominal volumeindex (AVI) and body mass index(BMI)were calculated. The individual 10-year CVDrisk was estimated based on ACC/AHA model. ROC analysis was performed to assessthe diagnostic ability of different abdominal obesity measures and body massindex (BMI) in predicting of high risk of CVD events.RESULTS: About 42.5% of men and 15% of women had at least 10% risk of 10-yearcardiovascular events and 21.1% of men and 3.0% of women had ³20% risk. ExceptWHR for men, all abdominal obesity measures significant predictors for ³10% risk CVD risk in both sexes but not BMI. The greater ability of CVD risk predictionwas observed by WHtR and CI in both sexes with higher AUC in females comparedwith men for ³10% risk.CONCLUSION: WHtR and CI are superior indexes in predicting of high risk of CVDevents in both sexes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evidence for a Non-leptin System that Defends against Weight Gain in Overfeeding.,/pubmed/29937378,"Weight is defended so that increases or decreases in body mass elicit responsesthat favor restoration of one's previous weight. While much is known about thesignals that respond to weight loss and the central role that leptin plays, thelack of experimental systems studying the overfed state has meant little is knownabout pathways defending against weight gain. We developed a system to study thisphysiology and found that overfed mice defend against increased weight gain with graded anorexia but, unlike weight loss, this response is independent ofcirculating leptin concentration. In overfed mice that are unresponsive toorexigenic stimuli, adipose tissue is transcriptionally and immunologicallydistinct from fat of ad libitum-fed obese animals. These findings provideevidence that overfeeding-induced obesity alters adipose tissue and centralresponses in ways that are distinct from ad libitum obesity and activates anon-leptin system to defend against weight gain.",N,,,,,,,,,,

In DIO mice fed with differentiallycomposed low- or high-fat diets, acute and subchronic treatment with 5-PAHSA and 9-PAHSA alone, or in combination, did not significantly improve the derangedmetabolic status. Neither racemic 5- or 9-PAHSA, nor the enantiomers were ableto: (1) increase basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake inÊvitro, (2)stimulate GLP-1 release from GLUTag cells, or (3) induce GSIS in rat, mouse, orhuman islets or in a human pancreatic _ cell line.

Autophagy Regulates the Liver Clock and Glucose Metabolism by Degrading CRY1.,/pubmed/29937374,"The circadian clock coordinates behavioral and circadian cues with availabilityand utilization of nutrients. Proteasomal degradation of clock repressors, suchas cryptochrome (CRY)1, maintains periodicity. Whether macroautophagy, a quality control pathway, degrades circadian proteins remains unknown. Here we show thatcircadian proteins BMAL1, CLOCK, REV-ERB_, and CRY1 are lysosomal targets, andthat macroautophagy affects the circadian clock by selectively degrading CRY1.Autophagic degradation of CRY1, an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, occurs in adiurnal window when rodents rely on gluconeogenesis, suggesting that CRY1degradation is time-imprintedÊto maintenance of blood glucose. High-fat feedingaccelerates autophagic CRY1 degradation and contributes to obesity-associatedhyperglycemia. CRY1 contains several light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting region (LIR)motifs, which facilitate the interaction of cargo proteins with the autophagosomemarker LC3. Using mutational analyses, we identified two distinct LIRs on CRY1that exert circadian glycemic control by regulating CRY1 degradation, revealingLIRs as potential targets for controlling hyperglycemia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"The adenosine, adrenergic and opioid pathways in the regulation of insulin secretion, beta cell proliferation and regeneration.",/pubmed/29937364,"Insulin, a key hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells precisely regulatesglucose metabolism in vertebrates. In type 1 diabetes, the beta cell mass isdestroyed, a process triggered by a combination of environmental and geneticfactors. This ultimately results in absolute insulin deficiency and dysregulated glucose metabolism resulting in a number of detrimental pathophysiologicaleffects. The traditional focus of treating type 1 diabetes has been to controlblood sugar levels through the administration of exogenous insulin. Newerapproaches aim to replace the beta cell mass through pancreatic or islettransplantation. Type 2 diabetes results from a relative insulin deficiency forthe prevailing insulin resistance. Treatments are generally aimed at reducinginsulin resistance and/or augmenting insulin secretion and the use of insulinitself is often required. It is increasingly being recognized that the beta cell mass is dynamic and increases insulin secretion in response to beta cell mitogensand stress signals to maintain glycemia within a very narrow physiological range.This review critically discusses the role of adrenergic, adenosine and opioidpathways and their interrelationship in insulin secretion, beta cellproliferation and regeneration.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Distally Based Medial Plantar Flap: A Classification of the Surgical Techniques.,/pubmed/29937338,"The proximally based medial plantar flap is considered to be the referencestandard for heel reconstruction. Although less well-studied, a distally basedmedial plantar flap is a suitable alternative when used to cover a distal footdefect, especially of the hallux, first metatarsal, or metatarsophalangeal joint.Our objective was to provide a complete description and propose a classification of the different surgical procedures used to harvest this flap. A review of thedata reported in the MEDLINE database until May 2017 concerning the distallybased medial plantar flap was performed. We have illustrated the differentsurgical procedures through a case series. Three approaches or ""types"" of flaphave been described, and we have proposed a classification for reconstructivesurgeons. In type 1, the plantar pedicle is ligatured before division into themedial and lateral plantar artery. In type 2, the medial plantar pedicle is cutproximally just after division. In type 3, the flap is harvested to include thefasciocutaneous perforator vessels, as an advancement flap or a propellerperforator flap. A distally based medial plantar flap affords adequate andreliable coverage of the weightbearing zone. Because the donor site drawbacks areminimal, this flap is a useful option for distal foot reconstruction, andreconstructive surgeons should remember this flap. The type 1 flap appears to be associated with a minimal risk of flap necrosis, even in those with diabetes orarteriopathy, and can cover even the most distal defect.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Excess Cost and Healthcare Resources Associated With Delayed Diagnosis of Charcot Foot.,/pubmed/29937337,"The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the effect of a delayeddiagnosis of Charcot foot on acute care cost and usage. We used InternationalClassification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, and theCalifornia Office for Statewide Health Planning and Development 2009 to 2012public patient discharge files to identify patients with type 2 diabetes mellitusand Charcot foot. The costs and length of stay were compared for those with adiagnosis of Charcot foot on admission compared with those who received a delayeddiagnosis of Charcot foot before discharge. Patient demographic data, diagnosesoften mistaken for Charcot foot, and procedures often performed for Charcot foot were assessed to determine the potential effect on costs and length of stay inCharcot foot subjects. A delayed Charcot foot diagnosis was associated with 10.8%greater inpatient costs and 12.1% longer length of stay. These patients required greater resource usage owing to the significantly greater number of proceduresperformed. A significantly greater number of patients underwent lower extremityamputation when the diagnosis was delayed, resulting in a 30.4% increase in costsand 31.6% longer length of stay. A greater rate of diabetic foot ulcers, footinfections, and osteomyelitis was also observed; however, the cost was onlyaffected by osteomyelitis, and the length of stay was not significantly affected.A delayed diagnosis of Charcot foot at admission resulted in significantlyincreased acute care costs and longer lengths of stay.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Resistin is elevated in cystic fibrosis sputum and correlates negatively with lung function.,/pubmed/29937317,"BACKGROUND: Resistin is an immunometabolic mediator that is elevated in severalinflammatory disorders. A ligand for Toll-like receptor 4, resistin modulates therecruitment and activation of myeloid cells, notably neutrophils. Neutrophils aremajor drivers of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, in part due to the release ofhuman neutrophil elastase- and myeloperoxidase-rich primary granules, leading to tissue damage. Here we assessed the relationship of resistin to CF lung disease.METHODS: Resistin levels were measured in plasma and sputum from threeretrospective CF cohorts spanning a wide range of disease. We also assessed theability of neutrophils to secrete resistin upon activation in vitro. Finally, we constructed a multivariate model assessing the relationship between resistinlevels and lung function.RESULTS: Plasma resistin levels were only marginally higher in CF than in healthycontrol subjects. By contrast, sputum resistin levels were very high in CF,reaching 50-100 fold higher levels than in plasma. Among CF patients, higherplasma resistin levels were associated with allergic bronchopulmonaryaspergillosis, and higher sputum resistin levels were associated with CF-related diabetes. Mechanistically, in vitro release of neutrophil primary granules wasconcomitant with resistin secretion. Overall, sputum resistin levels werenegatively correlated with CF lung function, independently of other variables(age, sex, and genotype).CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish relationships between resistin levels in theplasma and sputum of CF patients that correlate with disease status, and identifyresistin as a novel mechanistic link between neutrophilic inflammation and lungdisease in CF.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of thelong-term effects of canagliflozin on a range of sustained and adjudicated renal outcomes.METHODS: The CANVAS Program consists of two double-blind, randomised trials that assessed canagliflozin versus placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes whowere at high risk of cardiovascular events, done at 667 centres in 30 countries. People with type 2 diabetes and an HbA1c of 7á0-10á5% (53-91 mmol/mol) who wereaged at least 30 years and had a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, or who were aged at least 50 years and had at least two cardiovascularrisk factors were eligible to participate. Participants in CANVAS were randomlyassigned (1:1:1) to receive 300 mg canagliflozin, 100 mg canagliflozin, ormatching placebo once daily. Participants in CANVAS-R were randomly assigned(1:1) to receive canagliflozin or matching placebo, at an initial dose of 100 mg daily, with optional uptitration to 300 mg from week 13 or matching placebo.Participants and all study staff were masked to treatment allocations until studycompletion. Prespecified outcomes reported here include a composite of sustained and adjudicated doubling in serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes; the individual components of this composite outcome; annualreductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and changes in urinaryalbumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).

GLP-2 receptor signaling controls circulating bile acid levels but not glucose homeostasis in Gcgr(-/-) mice and is dispensable for the metabolic benefits ensuing after vertical sleeve gastrectomy.,/pubmed/29937214,"OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic interventions that improve glucose homeostasis such asattenuation of glucagon receptor (Gcgr) signaling and bariatric surgery sharecommon metabolic features conserved in mice and humans. These include increasedcirculating levels of bile acids (BA) and the proglucagon-derived peptides(PGDPs), GLP-1 and GLP-2. Whether BA acting through TGR5 (Gpbar1) increases PGDP levels in these scenarios has not been examined. Furthermore, although theimportance of GLP-1 action has been interrogated in Gcgr-/- mice and afterbariatric surgery, whether GLP-2 contributes to the metabolic benefits of theseinterventions is not known.METHODS: To assess whether BA acting through Gpbar1 mediates improved glucosehomeostasis in Gcgr-/- mice we generated and characterized Gcgr-/-:Gpbar1-/-mice. The contribution of GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) signaling to intestinal andmetabolic adaptation arising following loss of the Gcgr was studied inGcgr-/-:Glp2r-/- mice. The role of the GLP-2R in the metabolic improvementsevident after bariatric surgery was studied in high fat-fed Glp2r-/- micesubjected to vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).RESULTS: Circulating levels of BA were markedly elevated yet similar inGcgr-/-:Gpbar1+/+ vs. Gcgr-/-:Gpbar1-/- mice. Loss of GLP-2R lowered levels of BAin Gcgr-/- mice. Gcgr-/-:Glp2r-/- mice also exhibited shifts in the proportion ofcirculating BA species. Loss of Gpbar1 did not impact body weight, intestinalmass, or glucose homeostasis in Gcgr-/- mice. In contrast, small bowel growth wasattenuated in Gcgr-/-:Glp2r-/- mice. The improvement in glucose tolerance,elevated circulating levels of GLP-1, and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were not different in Gcgr-/-:Glp2r+/+ vs. Gcgr-/-:Glp2r-/- mice. Similarly, loss ofthe GLP-2R did not attenuate the extent of weight loss and improvement in glucosecontrol after VSG.CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that GLP-2R controls BA levels and relativeproportions of BA species in Gcgr-/- mice. Nevertheless, the GLP-2R is notessential for i) control of body weight or glucose homeostasis in Gcgr-/- mice orii) metabolic improvements arising after VSG in high fat-fed mice. Furthermore,despite elevations of circulating levels of BA, Gpbar1 does not mediate elevated levels of PGDPs or major metabolic phenotypes in Gcgr-/- mice. Collectively thesefindings refine our understanding of the relationship between Gpbar1, elevatedlevels of BA, PGDPs, and the GLP-2R in amelioration of metabolic derangementsarising following loss of Gcgr signaling or after vertical sleeve gastrectomy.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Using this IBD profile, DRUIDinfers relatedness between unobserved ancestors and more distant relatives,thereby combining information from multiple samples to remove one or moregenerations between the deep relationships to be identified. DRUID constructssets of close relatives by detecting full siblings and also uses an approach toidentify the aunts/uncles of two or more siblings, recovering 92.2% of realaunts/uncles with zero false positives. In real and simulated data, DRUIDcorrectly infers up to 10.5% more relatives than PADRE when using data from twosets of distantly related siblings, and 10.7%-31.3% more relatives given two setsof siblings and their aunts/uncles.

Latent class growth modeling (SAS: PROC TRAJ) wasapplied to analyze BMI z score over time.RESULTS: Six distinct BMI z score trajectories were identified (group 1: 7% ofpatients, group 2: 22%, group 3: 20%, group 4: 16%, group 5: 25%, and group 6:10%). Group 1, 2, 5, and 6 had an almost stable BMI z score, either in the low,near-normal, high stable, or chronic overweight range. Group 3 (60% girls)increased their BMI during puberty, whereas group 4 (65% boys) had a BMIdecrease. Similar patterns were observed for girls only, whereas boys followednearly stable trajectories without fluctuation over time. Between the near-normaland the other groups, significant differences (P_<_.05) in sex ratio, migrationbackground, mental health, height z score, glycated hemoglobin A1c, diabetestreatment, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking were observed.CONCLUSIONS: In youth with type 1 diabetes, a great heterogeneity of BMI z score trajectories exists that highlight the importance of personalized sex-specificintervention programs for subjects at risk for unfavorable BMI development.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Changes in the National Diabetes Prevention Program Present Opportunities for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists to Reduce the Prevalence of Diabetes.,/pubmed/29937054,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves comorbidities such as diabetes andhypertension and lowers the risk of obesity-related cancers. To better understandthe physiologic and genetic influences of bariatric surgery, a reliable murinemodel is needed that can be extended to genetically engineered mice. Given thecomplexity of these procedures, few researchers have successfully implementedthese techniques beyond larger rodent models. The purpose of our study was todevelop a technically feasible and reproducible murine model for RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Mice were converted to liquid diet perioperatively withoutfasting and housed in groups on raised wire platforms. SG involved significantreduction of stomach volume followed by multilayer repair of the gastrotomy. RYGBprocedure consisted of side-to-side, functional end-to-side bowel anastomoses andexclusion of the stomach medial to the gastroesophageal junction. Sham surgeries consisted of enterotomies and gastrotomy followed by primary repair withoutresection or rerouting. Survival after incorporation of the aforementionedtechniques was 100% in the SG group and 41% in the RYGB group at 1Êmo aftersurgery. Only 26% of RYGB mortality was attributed to leak, obstruction, orstricture; the majority of postoperative mortality was due to stress, dumping, ormalnutrition. Much of the survival challenge for this surgical model was related to perioperative husbandry, which is to be expected given their small stature andpoor response to stress. Utilization of the perioperative and surgical techniquesdescribed will increase survival and feasibility of these technically challengingprocedures, allowing for a better understanding of mechanisms to explain thebeneficial effects of bariatric surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effects of different foods on blood glucose and lipid in type 2 diabetes mellitus in a rat model.,/pubmed/29936998,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) and new biliopancreatic diversion (NBPD) on blood glucose and lipid levels intype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An additional goal was to explore the potential mechanism or mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of surgery on T2DM.METHODS: Rats were fed a high-fat, high-glucose diet and then wereintraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin, 35Êmg/kg, to induce T2DM. Then,33 T2DM rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups, a DJB group, an NBPD group, or a sham group. Fasting body weight, fasting glucose, and 2-hpostprandial glucose were measured before and after surgery. Then, the rats were intragastrically administered lipid emulsion, peanut oil, glucose, starch, andAnsul, and blood glucose and lipid levels were measured.RESULTS: One week after surgery, 2-h postprandial glucose decreased from24.41Ê±Ê2.28Êmmol/L before surgery to 19.87Ê±Ê4.07Êmmol/L after surgery in theDJB group, and from 25.88Ê±Ê1.91Êmmol/L before surgery to 20.34Ê±Ê5.76Êmmol/Lafter surgery in the NBPD group. After intragastric administration of lipidemulsion, free fatty acid levels increased from 534.60Ê±Ê70.99 to1082.83Ê±Ê259.67 _Eq/L in the DJB group and from 648.33Ê±Ê139.26 to1258.67Ê±Ê204.18 _Eq/L in the NBPD group. After surgery, free fatty acid levelsin the DJB group and NBPD group were significantly lower than those in the shamgroup.CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial blood glucose and lipids decreased after DJB and NBPD, which may be ascribed to postoperative changes in digestion and absorption.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Protective effects of Tat-DJ-1 protein against streptozotocin-induced diabetes in a mice model.,/pubmed/29936932,"A major feature of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is hyperglycemia anddysfunction of pancreatic _-cells. In a previous study, we have shown thatTat-DJ-1 protein inhibits pancreatic RINm5F _-cell death caused by oxidativestress. In this study, we examined effects of Tat-DJ-1 protein on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Wild type (WT) Tat-DJ-1 protein transduced intopancreas where it markedly inhibited pancreatic _-cell destruction and regulated levels of serum parameters including insulin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), andfree fatty acid (FFA) secretion. In addition, transduced WT Tat-DJ-1 proteinsignificantly inhibited the activation of NF-_B and MAPK (ERK and p38) expressionas well as expression of COX-2 and iNOS in STZ exposed pancreas. In contrast,treatment with C106A mutant Tat-DJ-1 protein showed no protective effects.Collectively, our results indicate that WT Tat-DJ-1 protein can significantlyameliorate pancreatic tissues in STZ-induced diabetes in mice.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose ofthis study was to examine the levels of glucose, lipids and antioxidant capacity of type 2 diabetes patients after liquid ubiquinol supplementation. This studywas designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In all,fifty participants were randomly assigned to a placebo (n 25) or liquid ubiquinol(100 mg/d, n 25) group, and the intervention lasted for 12 weeks. Plasma coenzymeQ10, glucose homoeostasis parameters, lipid profiles, oxidative stress andantioxidative enzyme activities were measured during the study. After 12 weeks ofsupplementation, glyco Hb (HbA1c) value was significantly decreased in the liquidubiquinol group (P=0á03), and subjects in the liquid ubiquinol group hadsignificantly lower anti-glycaemic medication effect scores (MES) compared withthose in the placebo group (P=0á03). The catalase (P<0á01) and glutathioneperoxidase (P=0á03) activities were increased significantly aftersupplementation.

[Prevalence of diabetes in Chinese adults: a Meta-analysis].,/pubmed/29936760,"Objective: To evaluate the prevalence and trend of diabetes mellitus amongChinese adults during the past thirty years. Methods: Papers, published beforeOctober 1, 2017 and related to the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Chinese adults, were searched through PubMed, China Knowledge Resource IntegratedDatabase, Wanfang Digital Database and VIP Citation Databases. Stata 13.0software was used to estimate the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, with pooledprevalence calculated based on random effects. Subgroup analysis was conductedbased on time, sex, areas and body mass index groups of investigation. Continuousfractional polynomial regression model on the midpoint of each survey period,weighted by the number of participants in each study, was used to estimate andillustrate the trends of prevalence of diabetes over the years. Results: Intotal, 15 studies were included and two of them were excluded in the primaryanalysis with the age limitation of participants as ³40 years old, forrecruitment. The average prevalence of diabetes among Chinese adults was 6.3%(95%CI: 4.6%-8.0%), during the past thirty years. The pooled prevalence appeared higher in urban than in rural areas and higher in men than in women. Between 1980and 2013, the increase of Chinese diabetes prevalence did not follow the lineartrend. Before 2000, the average prevalence showed as 3.5% (95%CI: 2.0%-4.9%),with an annual increase rate as 0.17%.

Impact of Reducing Glycated Hemoglobin on Healthcare Costs Among a Population with Uncontrolled Diabetes.,/pubmed/29936685,"INTRODUCTION: Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is considered a ""gold standard"" measureof glycemic control in patients with diabetes and is correlated with a lower riskof diabetes complications and cost savings. This retrospective claims-analysisassessed the impact of A1C reduction on healthcare costs in patients withuncontrolled Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.METHODS: Using a large repository of US health plan administrative data linked toA1C values, patients with a diabetes diagnosis and at least two A1C valuesbetween 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014 were selected to identify changes in A1C and associated changes in healthcare expenditure. We used all medical andpharmacy claims to calculate direct healthcare costs from 1 year prior to theindex A1C to 2 years after the index A1C. A propensity score method was used tomatch patients with decreased A1C to patients whose A1C did not decrease, basedon potentially confounding variables. Then, a generalized linear model regressionwas used to estimate the difference-in-difference (DD) effect on costs betweenthe two groups.RESULTS: Of the 3,197 patients who had a first A1C ³Ê9%, 2,273 patients (71%) hada decrease in A1C (Decreasers) and 924 patients (27%) had an increase in A1C(Non-decreasers). After matching, we compared 912 Decreasers to 912Non-decreasers. Patients in the former group had average annual healthcare costs that were 24% lower during the first year of follow-up and 17% lower during thesecond year of follow-up, compared to patients whose A1C did not decrease. Thisreflected a savings of US$2503 and US$1690, respectively. For both time periods, the outpatient category was the largest contributor to cost savings.DISCUSSION: In our analysis, A1C reduction among patients with T1DM and T2DM was associated with slower growth in healthcare costs within 1-2 years. Thesefindings suggest that programs aimed at reducing A1C over a short timeframe maylead to substantial savings and may be worth pursuing by health plans and otherpayers.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical outcomes in male patients with lactotroph adenomas who required pituitary surgery: a retrospective single center study.,/pubmed/29936681,"PURPOSE: Lactotroph adenomas (LA) are the most frequently encountered pituitarytumors. Although more frequently observed in women, LAs in men were recentlyincluded in a more aggressive category regardless of histological grading, by theWHO. We aimed to perform a rigorous retrospective review of a single center'spre-operative evaluation, patient characteristics and outcomes of male LAspatients requiring pituitary surgery.METHODS: A retrospective review, over 11 years, of patients who underwentresection of a pituitary adenoma at a single center was conducted. Predictors of persistent disease in male LAs patients along with a comparison to predictors of silent corticotroph adenomas (SCAs) patients who also underwent surgery at thecenter was also conducted.RESULTS: Thirty-one male patients with LAs were identified. When compared to SCAspatients, LAs male patients were younger (41 vs. 50Êyears of age, p_=_0.01). Men with LAs had more invasive tumors (75% vs. 44.7% p_=_0.02).

Home Visitations for Delivering an Early Childhood Obesity Intervention in Denver: Parent and Patient Navigator Perspectives.,/pubmed/29936658,"Objective This qualitative study explored parent and patient navigatorperspectives of home visitation as part of a childhood obesity program in alow-income, largely Latino population. Methods Three patient navigators and 25parents who participated in a home-based, childhood obesity program participated in focus groups or interviews. Emergent themes were identified through contentanalysis of qualitative data. Results Three overall themes were identified.Patient navigators and parents perceived: (1) enabling characteristics ofhome-based program delivery which facilitated family participation and/orbehavior change (i.e., convenience, increased accountability, inclusion ofhousehold members, delivery in a familiar, intimate setting, and individualizedpace and content); (2) logistic and cultural challenges to home-based deliverywhich reduced family participation and program reach (i.e., difficultiesscheduling visits, discomfort with visitors in the home, and confusion about the patient navigator's role); and (3) remediable home-based delivery challengeswhich could be ameliorated by additional study staff (e.g., supervision ofchildren, safety concerns) or through organized group sessions. Both patientnavigators and participating parents discussed an interest in group classes with separate, supervised child-targeted programming and opportunities to engage with other families for social support. Conclusions for Practice A home visitationprogram delivering a pediatric obesity prevention curriculum in Denver wasconvenient and held families accountable, but posed scheduling difficulties andraised safety concerns. Conducting home visits in pairs, adding obesityprevention curriculum to existing home visiting programs, or pairing theconvenience of home visits with group classes may be future strategies toexplore.",N,,,,,,,,,,

More than half of the cases are associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The primary clinical manifestation is muscle weakness. The pathology isdue to the generation of antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC)on presynaptic nerve terminals leading to a decrease in the neurotransmitteracetylcholine (ACh). This topic will review the pathogenesis, diagnostic testing,and treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH).,/pubmed/29939554,"Syndrome of inappropriateÊantidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH) is a conditiondefined by the unsuppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from thepituitary gland or nonpituitary sources or its continued action on vasopressinreceptors. The condition was first detected in two lung cancer patients byWilliam Schwartz and Frederic Bartter in 1967. They developed the classicSchwartz and Bartter criteria for the diagnosis of SIADH which has not changed.SIADH is characterized by impaired water excretion leading to hyponatremia withhypervolemia or euvolemia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Improvement of sensitive and specific detection of circulating tumor cells using negative enrichment and immunostaining-FISH.,/pubmed/29940145,"BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide an opportunity to obtainpivotal biological information required for the development of personalizedmedicine. However, the current assays of CTCs' detection face serious challenges regarding specificity and sensitivity.METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel strategy that combined negativeenrichment (NE), immunocytochemistry CD45 staining and fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) to identify, enumerate and characterize CTCs. CTCs wereidentified as DAPI+/CD45-/Chromosome multiploid. The assay was evaluated withdifferent cancer cell lines including lung, breast, esophageal and gastriccancer. And then, the developed assay was applied in cancer patients to explorethe possibility of clinical application and whether CTC number was related toclinicopathological factors.RESULTS: The average recover rate of esophageal cancer cell line Eca-109 usingnegative enrichment was higher than 80% and the multiploid cells rate of fourcancer cell lines were >96%, which demonstrate the NE-FISH platform is favorable for CTCs detection. CTCs count was significantly higher in lung cancer patientsthan healthy controls and benign lung disease with an area under ROC curve of0.905 (95% confidence interval 0.866-0.944, P_<_.001). Using a cutoff value of 2 CTCs, the positive rate of detecting lung, gastric, breast and esophageal cancer patients were 71.33%, 86.21%, 76.77% and 78.35%, respectively. Besides, CTCscould be detected in stage I with the positive rate of 64.15% for lung cancer,83.33% for gastric cancer, 78.95% for breast cancer and 68.18% for esophagealcancer, which may promote the early diagnose and influence the treatment decisionfor better management of those cancer in clinic.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that CTCs could be detected in diverse cancersusing the novel NE-FISH platform with high sensitivity and specificity.Therefore, analysis of CTCs with NE-FISH has a clear potential to improve themanagement of cancer patients in clinical use.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Verteporfin-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(beta-amino ester)-poly(ethylene glycol) triblock micelles for cancer therapy.,/pubmed/29940101,"Amphiphilic polymers can be used to form micelles to deliver water-insolubledrugs. A biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-poly(beta-amino ester)(PBAE)-PEG triblock copolymer was developed that is useful for drug delivery. It was shown to successfully encapsulate and pH-dependently release awater-insoluble, small molecule anti-cancer drug, verteporfin. PEG-PBAE-PEGmicelle morphology was also controlled through variations to the hydrophobicityof the central PBAE block of the copolymer in order to evade macrophage uptake.Spherical micelles were 50 nm in diameter, while filamentous micelles were 31 nm in width with an average aspect ratio of 20. When delivered to RAW 264.7 mousemacrophages, filamentous micelles exhibited a 89% drop in cellular uptakepercentage and a 5.6-fold drop in normalized geometric mean cellular uptakecompared to spherical micelles. This demonstrates the potential of high aspectratio, anisotropic shaped PEG-PBAE-PEG micelles to evade macrophage-mediatedclearance. Both spherical and filamentous micelles also showed therapeuticefficacy in human triple-negative breast cancer and small cell lung cancer cells without requiring photodynamic therapy to achieve an anti-cancer effect. Bothspherical and filamentous micelles were more effective in killing lung cancercells than breast cancer cells at equivalent verteporfin concentrations, whilespherical micelles were shown to be more effective than filamentous micellesagainst both cancer cells. Spherical and filamentous micelles at 5 and 10 µMrespective verteporfin concentration resulted in 100% cell killing of lung cancercells, but both micelles required a higher verteporfin concentration of 20 µM to kill breast cancer cells at the levels of 80% and 50% respectively. This workdemonstrates the potential of PEG-PBAE-PEG as a biodegradable, anisotropic drugdelivery system as well as the in vitro use of verteporfin-loaded micelles forcancer therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer: Which Molecular Tests Are Needed for Optimal Treatment Decision Making?,/pubmed/29940057,"The management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changeddramatically over the past few years due to our expanded knowledge of themolecular basis of lung cancer (driver mutations and immune targets) and drugsthat affect these pathways, namely targeted agents and checkpoint inhibitors.Consequently, it is important to test patients with newly diagnosed advancedNSCLC for potentially significant molecular abnormalities prior to the initiationof treatment. This requires close coordination between the surgical pathologist, the molecular pathologist, and the medical oncologist to ensure that the biopsyspecimen is used judiciously to get all necessary information. In this article, Isuggest an approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with newly diagnosedadvanced NSCLC, in an attempt to identify the best treatment options for each.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Interstitial lung abnormalities: prognostic stratification of subtle radiological findings.,/pubmed/29939864,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide the radiologicaldescription of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) as an increasingly reported entity on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and to discuss theirprospective interpretation.RECENT FINDINGS: Elementary findings consistent with ILA are described on HRCT,yet the diagnostic confidence for the interpretation of these subtle featuresmight be challenging and further hampered by interobserver variability.Quantitative analysis is expected to provide standardized and reproducibledescription of ILA. There is affinity between ILA morphology andhistopathological pattern, either fibrosis or atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.Beyond radiology, there are predictors of risk of ILA, such as: age, smokinghabit, circulating biomarkers, and genetic sequencing. ILA with fibroticmorphology show prognostic impact including progression to interstitial lungdisease, mortality from respiratory disease, and all-cause mortality. Theassociation between ILA and susceptibility to lung damage further includes theinterlacing connection between interstitial findings and lung cancer, both as arisk factor for diagnosis and as a predictor of survival.SUMMARY: ILA are a (minor) finding on HRCT and they should be reported byradiologists for optimal management within the specific clinic-functionalscenario. ILA encompass a number of semiological characteristics associated with either fibrotic or nonfibrotic disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Optimal threshold selection methods under tree or umbrella ordering.,/pubmed/29939828,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a popular tool for evaluatingdiagnostic accuracy of biomarkers. In ROC framework, there exist several optimal threshold selection methods for binary classification. For diseases withmulti-classes, an important category of scenarios is tree or umbrella ordering inwhich the marker measurement for one particular class is lower or higher thanthose for the rest classes. Tree or umbrella ordering has important clinicalapplications, especially in the molecular diagnostics of cancer subtypes. The ROCcurve has been extended to a typical ROC framework for tree or umbrella ordering (denoted as TROC). In this paper, we investigate several methods for optimalthreshold selection under tree or umbrella ordering. Simulation studies arecarried out to explore the performance of these threshold selection methods. Areal microarray data set on lung cancer is analyzed using the proposed methods.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A glutamine-rich carrier efficiently delivers anti-CD47 siRNA driven by ""glutamine trap"" to inhibit lung cancer cell growth.",/pubmed/29939755,"It is not efficient enough using the current approaches for tumor-selective drug delivery based on the EPR effect and ligand-receptor interactions, and they have largely failed to translate into the clinic. So it is urgent to explore anenhanced strategy for effective delivery of anticancer agents. Clinically, manycancers require large amounts of glutamine for their continued growth andsurvival, resulting in circulating glutamine extraction by the tumor being muchgreater than that for any organs, behaving as a ""glutamine trap"". In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether the glutamine trap effect could beexploited to deliver therapeutic agents to selectively kill cancer cells. Here, amacromolecular glutamine analog, glutamine-functionalized branchedpolyethylenimine (GPI), was constructed as the carrier to deliver anti-CD47 siRNAfor the blockage of CD47 ""don't eat me"" signals on cancer cells. The GPI/siRNAglutamine-rich polyplexes exhibited remarkably high levels of cellular uptake by glutamine-dependent lung cancer cells, wild-type A549 cells (A549WT) and itscisplatin-resistant cells (A549DDP), specifically under glutamine-depletedconditions. It was noted that the glutamine transporter ASCT2 was highlyexpressed both on A549WT and A549DDP, but almost no expression in normal humanlung fibroblasts cells. Inhibition of ASCT2 significantly prevented theinternalization of GPI polyplexes. These findings raised the intriguingpossibility that the glutamine-rich GPI polyplexes utilize the ASCT2 pathway toselectively facilitate their cellular uptake by cancer cells. GPI furtherdelivered anti-CD47 siRNA efficiently both in vitro and in vivo to down-regulate the intratumoral mRNA and protein expression levels of CD47. CD47 functions as a ""don't eat me"" signal and binds to the immunoreceptor SIRP_ inducing evasion ofphagocytic clearance. GPI/anti-CD47 siRNA polyplexes achieved significantantitumor activities both on A549WT and A549DDP tumor-bearing nude mice. Notably,it had no adverse effect on CD47-expressing red blood cells and platelets, likelydue to selective delivery. Therefore, the glutamine-rich carrier GPI driven bythe glutamine trap effect provides a promising new strategy for designinganticancer drug delivery systems.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Initial results of a lung cancer screening demonstration project: a local program evaluation.,/pubmed/29939501,"OBJECTIVES: To describe participation rates, results, and lessons learned from a lung cancer screening (LCS) demonstration project.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study at 1 of 8 centers participating in a national Veterans Health Administration LCS demonstration project.METHODS: An electronic health record (EHR) algorithm and tobacco pack-year (TPY) information prompt identified patients potentially eligible for LCS. LCSinvitation was planned to consist of shared decision-making materials, aninvitation letter to call the LCS manager, a reminder letter, and an outreachphone call for nonresponders. The outreach call was subsequently dropped due totime constraints on the LCS manager. Lung nodules and incidental findings on LCS low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) were recorded in templated radiology reports and tracked with EHR notes.RESULTS: Of 6133 potentially eligible patients, we identified 1388 patients with eligible TPY information: 918 were invited for LCS and 178 (19%) completed LCS.LCS completion was more likely in patients in the mailing-plus-call outreachgroup (phase I) compared with the mail-only group (phase II) (22% vs 9%; P<.001). Among those completing an LDCT, 61% had lung nodules requiring follow-up:43% of the nodules were less than 4 mm in diameter, 12 patients required further diagnostic evaluation, and 2 had lung malignancies. There were 179 incidentalLDCT findings in 116 patients, and 20% were clinically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Important considerations in LCS are accurate identification ofeligible patients, balancing invitation approaches with resource constraints, andestablishing standardized methods for tracking numerous small lung nodules andincidental findings detected by LDCT.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Nephrotoxicity and Renal Pathophysiology: A Contemporary Perspective.,/pubmed/29939355,"The kidney consists of numerous cell types functionally organized into thenephron, which is the basic functional unit of the kidney. Any stimuli thatinduce loss of these cells can induce kidney damage and renal failure. The cause of renal failure can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Extrinsic causes includecardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, sepsis, and lung and liver failure.Intrinsic causes include glomerular nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, renalfibrosis, tubular cell death and stones. The kidney plays a prominent role inmediating the toxicity of numerous drugs, environmental pollutants and naturalsubstances. Drugs known to be nephrotoxic include several cancer therapeutics,drugs of abuse, antibiotics and radiocontrast agents. Environmental pollutantsknown to target the kidney include cadmium, mercury, arsenic, lead,trichloroethylene, bromate, brominated-flame retardants, diglycolic acid andethylene glycol. Natural nephrotoxicants include aristolochic acids andmycotoxins such as ochratoxin, fumonisin B1 and citrinin. There are severalcommon characteristics between mechanisms of renal failure induced bynephrotoxicants and extrinsic causes. This common ground exists primarily due to similarities in the molecular mechanisms mediating renal cell death. This review summarizes the current state of the field of nephrotoxicity. It emphasizesintegrating our understanding of nephrotoxicity with pathological-induced renalfailure. Such approaches are needed to address major questions in the field,which include the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of both acute and chronicrenal failure, and the progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidneydisease.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Seven tumor sites, namely head and neck, liver,lung, colon and rectum, prostate, bone and soft tissue, and pancreas wereselected as eligible sites for receiving carbon-ion radiotherapy (RT) byradiation oncologists of the Korea Institute of Radiological and MedicalSciences. Cancer incidence data for the selected tumor sites were obtained fromthe Korea National Cancer Incidence Database in order to estimate the potentialmedical need for carbon-ion RT. The carbon-ion RT adaption rate was assessedbased on the clinical experience of other carbon-ion therapy facilities. Anestimation model was constructed for estimating the medical need for carbon-ionRT, and from this, 25 606 patients were deemed to be potential candidates forcarbon-ion RT. This estimated potential need corresponded to 10% of newlydiagnosed cancer patients in Korea. The realistic estimation was calculated asranging between 4000 and 6300 patients, depending on the carbon-ion RT adaptationrate. This estimated medical need corresponded to 2-3% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in Korea.

rs401681 and rs402710 confer lung cancer susceptibility by regulating TERT expression instead of CLPTM1L in East Asian.,/pubmed/29939218,"Lung cancer is a common cancer in human and has presented significant geneticpredisposition. Previous genome-wide association study observed that rs401681within CLPTM1L (CLPTM1 like) was significantly associated with lung cancer. Byanalyzing 1000 genomes data for East Asian, we identified only one SNP in nearby region, rs402710, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs401681, which was alsoassociated with lung cancer. However, the real causal SNP and mechanism for theassociation was still not clear. The following plasmid construction, mutagenesis,transient transfection and luciferase reading indicated that both SNPs couldregulate gene expression in lung/bronchial epithelium Beas-2B cell line. Bychromosome conformation capture, it was identified that the segment containingthese two SNPs could interact with TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase)promoter, thus indicating that these SNPs confer lung cancer risk by regulatingTERT expression instead of CLPTM1L. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, thetranscript factors HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) and MAF1 (MAF1homolog, negative regulator of RNA polymerase III) were recognized for theregions spanning rs401681 and rs402710, respectively.

PD-L1 immunoexpression in matched biopsy and liquid based cytology samples of advanced stage non-small cell lung carcinomas.,/pubmed/29938855,"OBJECTIVE: PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is essential in patients of advanced non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine eligibility for immunotherapy.PD-L1 IHC assays have been clinically validated only on FFPE tissue; however,lung cancer is frequently diagnosed on cytology. PD-L1 immunocytochemistry (ICC) has shown high concordance of immunoexpression between cytology samples andpaired small biopsies. Feasibility of liquid-based cytology (LBC) smears forPD-L1 ICC has not been analyzed previously.METHODS: PD-L1 ICC and IHC (clone SP263) were performed on paired LBC (BDSurePath) smears and small biopsies, respectively, in patients with advancedNSCLC. Cases with less than 100 viable tumor cells on LBC smear/biopsy wereexcluded from analysis. PD-L1 was interpreted positive when ³25% tumor cellsshowed membranous and/or cytoplasmic protein expression of any intensity greater than background staining.RESULTS: A total of 26 patients, harboring adenocarcinomas (50%) and squamouscell carcinomas (50%) had available bronchial brushings/washings processed as LBCsmears and concurrently obtained endobronchial biopsies. PD-L1 IHC wasinterpreted positive in 46% (12/26) biopsies. PD-L1 ICC was interpreted positive in 35% (9/26) LBC smears, all of which were IHC-positive. No IHC-negative casewas positive on cytology. The overall concordance between LBC smears and smallbiopsies was 88.4%.CONCLUSION: PD-L1 ICC can be performed on LBC processed smears, with certainchallenges in interpretation inherent to LBC smears and their processing methods.Nevertheless, they represent a potential resource for ICC, especially whenalternate histology material is not available.

An <i>in silico</i> performance characterization of respiratory motion guided 4DCT for high-quality low-dose lung cancer imaging.,/pubmed/29938683,"This work aims to characterize the performance of an improved 4DCT techniqueaiming to overcome irregular breathing-related image artifacts. To address this, we have developed respiratory motion guided (RMG) 4DCT, which uses real-timebreathing motion analysis to prospectively gate scans based on detection ofirregular breathing. This is the first investigation of RMG-4DCT using areal-time software prototype, testing the hypothesis that it can reduce breathingirregularities during imaging, reduce image oversampling and improve imagequality compared to a ""Conventional"" 4DCT protocol without breathing guidance.RMG-4DCT scans were simulated based on 100+ hours of breathing motion acquiredfor 20 lung cancer patients. Scan performance was quantified in terms of thebeam-on time (a surrogate for imaging dose), total scan time and the breathingirregularity during imaging (via RMSE of the breathing motion duringacquisition). A Conventional 4DCT protocol was also implemented using the samesoftware prototype for a direct comparator to the RMG-4DCT results. Weinvestigated the impact of key RMG-4DCT parameters such as gating tolerance,gantry rotation time and the use of baseline drift correction. Using arepresentative set of algorithm parameters, RMG-4DCT achieved significant meanreductions in estimated imaging dose (-17.8%, p&lt;0.001) and breathing RMSEduring imaging (-12.6%, p&lt;0.001) compared to Conventional 4DCT. Theseimprovements came with increased scan times, roughly doubled on average (104%,p&lt;0.001). Image quality simulations were performed using the deformabledigital XCAT phantom, with image quality quantified based on the normalized crosscorrelation (NCC) between axial slices. RMG-4DCT demonstrated qualitative imagequality improvements for 3 out of 10 phase bins, however the improvement was not significant across all 10 phases (p=0.08) at a population level. In choosingRMG-4DCT scan parameters, the trade-off between gating sensitivity and scan time may be optimized, demonstrating potential for RMG-4DCT as a viable pathway toimprove clinical 4DCT imaging.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Objective of this studywas to record the prevalence of ALK rearrangement in adenocarcinoma of PrimaryLung origin and compare it with ALK-IHC staining. Data of 64 patients of lungadenocarcinoma from 2015-2017 was analyzed. All of the FFPE biopsies were tested for EGFR (qPCR) followed by ALK rearrangement (by FISH and IHC) on EGFR negative samples. Out of 64 samples, 21.8% (14) showed EGFR mutations and 14% (7/50) were positive for ALK rearrangement when checked by FISH. In IHC testing for ALK (FISHpositive) 8% (4/50) showed positivity. In conclusion ALK-FISH positive cases are higher than other studies likely due to the relatively small sample size. FISHtesting was found to be more sensitive than IHC; one reason may be the low level of ALK. Our study warrants that currently FISH remains the gold standard forscreening of ALK gene rearrangements.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and its impact on innate immune responses in lung carcinoma A549 cells.,/pubmed/29938378,"The immune responses, involved in recognition of cancer-specific antigens, are ofparticular interest as this may provide major leads towards developing newvaccines and antibody therapies against cancer. An effective treatment for canceris still a challenge because there are many mechanisms through which the tumorcells can escape the host immune surveillance. Oxidative stress or respiratoryburst which is host's mechanism to kill the foreign particles is used as defense mechanism by the tumor cells. The tumor cells uses this oxidative stress to form neo-antigens which in turn makes them undetectable and can escape the host immunesurveillance. The human lung carcinoma (A549) cells were treated using 100ÊµMH2O2 to induce oxidative stress, and the extent oxidative modifications weredetected at the level of membrane and proteins in form of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls respectively. Nitric oxide and iNOS levels were estimated byGriess assay and immunostaining, respectively. The oxidized tumor proteins werevisualized on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The H2O2-treated (15Êmin and 24 hpost-treatment) A549 cells were co-cultured with THP-1 cells to subsequentlyvisualize the phagocytic activity by Giemsa and CFSE staining to understand therole of neo (oxidized) tumor antigens in eliciting alteration in immuneresponses. A significant decline in the percent engulfed cells and decrease inthe levels of reactive oxygen species was observed. Immunohistostaining forp47phox, which is an important indicator of the oxygen-dependent phagocytosis,showed a decrease in its levels when cells were treated for only 15Êmin with100ÊµM H2O2, whereas at 24-h post-treatment there was no change in the p47phoxlevels. The study has established oxidative stress as a new pathogenic mechanism of carcinogenesis and will open new avenues for clinical intervention, adjuncttherapies for cancer, and its control at the initial stage by targeting theseneo-antigens.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The brain-penetrant clinical ATM inhibitor AZD1390 radiosensitizes and improves survival of preclinical brain tumor models.,/pubmed/29938225,"Poor survival rates of patients with tumors arising from or disseminating intothe brain are attributed to an inability to excise all tumor tissue (ifoperable), a lack of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration ofchemotherapies/targeted agents, and an intrinsic tumor radio-/chemo-resistance.Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein orchestrates the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) to cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizingradiation (IR). ATM genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition results intumor cell hypersensitivity to IR. We report the primary pharmacology of theclinical-grade, exquisitely potent (cell IC50, 0.78 nM), highly selective[>10,000-fold over kinases within the same phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family], orally bioavailable ATM inhibitor AZD1390 specificallyoptimized for BBB penetration confirmed in cynomolgus monkey brain positronemission tomography (PET) imaging of microdosed 11C-labeled AZD1390 (Kp,uu,0.33). AZD1390 blocks ATM-dependent DDR pathway activity and combines withradiation to induce G2 cell cycle phase accumulation, micronuclei, and apoptosis.AZD1390 radiosensitizes glioma and lung cancer cell lines, with p53 mutant gliomacells generally being more radiosensitized than wild type. In in vivo syngeneicand patient-derived glioma as well as orthotopic lung-brain metastatic models,AZD1390 dosed in combination with daily fractions of IR (whole-brain orstereotactic radiotherapy) significantly induced tumor regressions and increased animal survival compared to IR treatment alone.

Immunity drives TET1 regulation in cancer through NF-ë¼B.,/pubmed/29938218,"Ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3), which induce DNAdemethylation and gene regulation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are often down-regulated in cancer. We uncover,in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), genome-wide 5hmC changes related to TET1regulation. We further demonstrate that TET1 repression is associated with highexpression of immune markers and high infiltration by immune cells. We identifyin BLBC tissues an anticorrelation between TET1 expression and the majorimmunoregulator family nuclear factor _B (NF-_B). In vitro and in mice, TET1 isdown-regulated in breast cancer cells upon NF-_B activation through binding ofp65 to its consensus sequence in the TET1 promoter. We lastly show that thesefindings extend to other cancer types, including melanoma, lung, and thyroidcancers. Together, our data suggest a novel mode of regulation for TET1 in cancerand highlight a new paradigm in which the immune system can influence cancer cellepigenetics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High miR-100 expression is associated with aggressive features and modulates TORC1 complex activation in lung carcinoids.,/pubmed/29938004,"Purpose: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a promising therapeutic targetin advanced lung carcinoid patients. However, the mechanisms of mTOR modulationand of responsiveness to mTOR inhibitors are largely unclear. Our aim was toanalyze the expression and functional role of specific miRNAs in lung carcinoids as an alternative mechanism targeting mTOR pathway.Experimental design: Seven miRNAs, selected by bioinformatic tools and literaturesearch, were analyzed in 142 lung neuroendocrine neoplasms (92 carcinoids and acontrol group of 50 high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas), and compared with mTORmRNA expression and clinical/pathological parameters. Tissue results werevalidated in vitro in two lung carcinoid cell lines by specific RNA interference and biological/pharmacological tests.Results: Tissutal expression of five miRNAs (miR-99b, miR-100, miR-155,miR-193a-3p, miR-193a-5p) was inversely correlated with mTOR mRNA expression,supporting their role in the negative regulation of mTOR transcription. Highexpression of miR-100, miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p was associated with aggressivefeatures and, for the former two, with shorter time to progression. In H727 andUMC11 lung carcinoid cells, miR-100 modulated mTOR RNA and TORC1 complex protein expression, positively promoted cell migration and negatively influenced cellproliferation. Moreover, miR-100 directly influenced responsiveness of H727 andUMC11 cells to rapamycin.Conclusions: MiR-100 actively participates to the regulation of mTOR expressionin lung carcinoids and represents a novel candidate prognostic biomarker for thistumor type; moreover, inhibition of its expression is associated to increasedresponsiveness to mTOR inhibitors and might represent a novel strategy tosensitize lung carcinoids to these target agents.",N,,,,,,,,,,

In a mice survival test, this binarysystem demonstrated longer persistence compared to the untreated and the monotreated ones. The reason underlying the advantage of this binary system over the mono system seems to be an overexpression of various hTERT suppressing factorsinduced by the mono system.",N,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is still a large fraction of patients that do not respondto checkpoint inhibitors, and the challenge remains to find cellular andmolecular cues that could predict which patients would benefit from thesetherapies. Using a series of qualitative and quantitative methods we show herethat PBMCs and platelets from smokers and patients with head and neck squamouscell carcinoma (HNSCC) or lung cancer express and up-regulate PD-L1 independentlyof tumor stage. Furthermore, treatment with Atezolizumab, a fully humanisedmonoclonal antibody against PD-L1, in 4 patients with lung cancer caused adecrease in PD-L1 expression in platelets, which was restored over 20 days.Altogether, our findings reveal the expression of the main therapeutic target in current checkpoint therapies in human platelets and highlight their potential as biomarkers to predict successful therapeutic outcomes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The landscape of somatic mutation in sporadic Chinese colorectal cancer.,/pubmed/29937994,"Colorectal cancer is the fifth prevalent cancer in China. Nevertheless, alarge-scale characterization of Chinese colorectal cancer mutation spectrum hasnot been carried out. In this study, we have performed whole exome-sequencinganalysis of 98 patients' tumor samples with matched pairs of normal colon tissuesusing Illumina and Complete Genomics high-throughput sequencing platforms.Canonical CRC somatic gene mutations with high prevalence (>10%) have beenverified, including TP53, APC, KRAS, SMAD4, FBXW7 and PIK3CA. PEG3 is identified as a novel frequently mutated gene (10.6%). APC and Wnt signaling exhibitsignificantly lower mutation frequencies than those in TCGA data. Analysis withclinical characteristics indicates that APC gene and Wnt signaling display lower mutation rate in lymph node positive cancer than negative ones, which are notobserved in TCGA data. APC gene and Wnt signaling are considered as the keymolecule and pathway for colorectal cancer initiation, and these findings greatlyundermine their importance in tumor progression for Chinese patients. Takentogether, the application of next-generation sequencing has led to thedetermination of novel somatic mutations and alternative disease mechanisms incolorectal cancer progression, which may be useful for understanding diseasemechanism and personalizing treatment for Chinese patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Targeting autophagy sensitises lung cancer cells to Src family kinase inhibitors.,/pubmed/29937990,"Lung cancer is the main cancer killer in both men and women, mostly due to therapid development of drug resistant metastatic disease. Here, we evaluate thepotential involvement of SRC family kinases (SFK) in lung cancer biology andassess the possible benefits of their inhibition as a therapeutic approach. Wedemonstrated that various SRC family members, including LYN and LCK, normallyexpressed solely in hematopoietic cells and neural tissues, are overexpressed andactivated in a panel of SCLC and NSCLC cell lines. This was clinically relevantas LYN and FYN are also overexpressed in lung cancer clinical specimens.Moreover, LYN overexpression correlated with decreased patient survival onunivariate and multivariate analysis. Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a SRC/ABLinhibitor, effectively blocked SFK activation at nanomolar concentrations whichcorrelated with a significant decrease in cell numbers of multiple lung cancercell lines. This effect was matched by a decrease in DNA synthesis, but onlymoderate induction of apoptosis. Indeed, dasatinib as well as PP2, another SFKinhibitor, strongly induced autophagy that likely prevented apoptosis. However,inhibition of this autophagic response induced robust apoptosis and sensitisedlung cancer cells to dasatinib in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide anexplanation for why dasatinib failed in NSCLC clinical trials. Furthermore, ourdata suggest that combining SFK inhibitors with autophagy inhibitors couldprovide a novel therapeutic approach in this disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Trends in Lung Cancer Incidence in Delhi, India 1988-2012: Age-Period-Cohort and Joinpoint Analyses",/pubmed/29937537,"Introduction: Lung cancer (LC) has been one of the most commonly diagnosedcancers worldwide, both in terms of new cases and mortality. Exponential growthof economic and industrial activities in recent decades in the Delhi urban areamay have increased the incidence of LC. The primary objective of this study wasto evaluate the time trend according to gender. Method: LC incidence data over 25years were obtained from the population based urban Delhi cancer registry.Joinpoint regression analysis was applied for evaluating the time trend ofage-standardized incidence rates. The age-period-cohort (APC) model was employed using Poisson distribution with a log link function and the intrinsic estimatormethod. Results: During the 25 years, 13,489 male and 3,259 female LC cases were registered, accounting for 9.78% of male and 2.53% of female total cancer cases. Joinpoint regression analysis revealed that LC incidence in males continued toincrease during the entire period, a sharp acceleration being observed startingfrom 2009. In females the LC incidence rate remained a plateau during 1988-2002and thereafter increased. The cumulative risks for 1988-2012 were 1.79% and0.45%. The full APC (IE) model showed best fit for an age-period-cohort effect onLC incidence, with significant increase with age peaking at 70-74 years in males and 65-69 years in females. A rising period effect was observed after adjustingfor age and cohort effects in both genders and a declining cohort effect wasidentified after controlling for age and period effects. Conclusion: Theincidence of LC in urban Delhi showed increasing trend from 1988-2012. Knownfactors such as environmental conservation, tobacco control, physical activityawareness and medical security should be implemented more vigorously over thelong term in our population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Screening Patterns and Mortality Differences in Patients With Lung Cancer at an Urban Underserved Community.,/pubmed/29937386,"BACKGROUND: The landmark National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated significantreduction in lung cancer-related mortality. However, European lung cancerscreening (LCS) trials have not confirmed such benefit. We examined LCS patterns and determined the impact of LCS-led diagnosis on the mortality of newlydiagnosed patients with lung cancer in an underserved community.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with primary lungcancer in 2013 through 2016 (nÊ= 855) were reviewed for primary care provider(PCP) status and LCS eligibility and completion, determined using United StatesPreventative Services Task Force guidelines. Univariate analyses of patientcharacteristics were conducted between LCS-eligible patients based on screeningcompletion. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression.RESULTS: In 2013 through 2016, 175 patients with primary lung cancer had anestablished PCP and were eligible for LCS. Among them, 19% (33/175) completedscreening prior to diagnosis. LCS completion was associated with younger age (PÊ=.02), active smoking status (PÊ< .01), earlier stage at time of diagnosis (PÊ<.01), follow-up in-network cancer treatment (PÊ= .03), and surgical management(PÊ< .01). LCS-eligible patients who underwent screening had improved all-causemortality compared with those not screened (PÊ< .01). Multivariate regressionshowed surgery (hazard ratio, 0.31; PÊ= .04) significantly affected mortality.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess LCS patterns and mortality differences on patients with screen-detected lung cancer in an urbanunderserved setting since the inception of United States Preventative ServicesTask Force guidelines. Patients with a LCS-led diagnosis had improved mortality, likely owing to cancer detection at earlier stages with curative treatment, whichechoes the finding of prospective trials.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of optical imaging agents in a fluorescence-guided surgical model of head and neck cancer.,/pubmed/29937175,"BACKGROUND: Tumor proliferation often occurs from pathologic receptorupregulation. These receptors provide unique targets for near-infrared (NIR)probes that have fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) applications. We demonstratethe use of three smart-targeted probes in a model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.METHODS: A dose escalation study was performed using IntegriSense750,ProSense750EX, and ProSense750FAST in mice (n_=_5) bearing luciferase-positiveSCC-1 flank xenograft tumors. Whole body fluorescence imaging was performedserially after intravenous injection using commercially available open-field(LUNA, Novadaq, Canada) and closed-field NIR systems (Pearl, LI-COR, Lincoln,NE). An exÊvivo, whole-body biodistribution was conducted. Lastly, FGS wasperformed with IntegriSense750 to demonstrate orthotopic and metastatic diseaselocalization.RESULTS: Disease fluorescence delineation was assessed by tumor-to-backgroundfluorescence ratios (TBR). Peak TBR values were 3.3 for 1_nmol ProSense750EX, 5.5for 6_nmol ProSense750FAST, and 10.8 for 4_nmol IntegriSense750_at 5.5, 3, and4_d post administration, respectively. Agent utility is unique: ProSense750FASTprovides sufficient contrast quickly (TBR: 1.5, 3_h) while IntegriSense750produces strong (TBR: 10.8) contrast with extended administration-to-resectiontime (96_h). IntegriSense750 correctly identified all diseased nodes in situduring exploratory surgeries. ExÊvivo, whole-body biodistribution was assessed bytumor-to-tissue fluorescence ratios (TTR). Agents provided sufficientfluorescence contrast to discriminate disease from background, TTR>1.IntegriSense750 was most robust in neural tissue (TTR: 64) while ProSense750EXwas superior localizing disease against lung tissue (TBR: 13).CONCLUSION: All three agents appear effective for FGS.",N,,,,,,,,,,

"CIMAvax-EGF, a therapeutic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer vaccine.",/pubmed/29936901,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer represents the most common cause of cancer deathworldwide. While the prognosis remains poor, immunotherapy is giving a positiveimpact on survival. Cancer vaccines represent a form of active immunotherapy thathistorically have given modest results in terms of efficacy. The overexpressionof the EGFR by tumor cells was reported in more than half of cases of lungcancer, representing a mechanism of cancerogenesis. CIMAvax-EGF, a therapeuticvaccine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed in Cuba, consists of ahuman recombinant EGF able to induce antibodies against the autologous EGF,resulting in serum EGF withdrawal and lower EGF-EGFR interaction. Area covered.We critically reviewed the existing literature about CIMAvax-EGF, from the Pilot studies to the efficacy controlled studies. We also overviewed the ongoingtrials. Expert Opinion. CIMAvax-EGF demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic. In aphase III randomized study CIMAvax-EGF, used as a switch maintenance treatmentafter platinum-based chemotherapy, did not significantly improve survival.Current data are not sufficient to recommend CIMAvax-EGF as a treatment optionfor advanced stage NSCLC. Further studies, conducted in a context of worldwidestandardized clinical practice, are needed to better define if a subpopulation ofpatients can benefit from the vaccination.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Diagnostic utility of endobronchial ultrasound features in differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes.,/pubmed/29936788,"Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) features have been shown to be useful inpredicting etiology of enlarged malignant lymph nodes. However, there is dearthof evidence especially from developing countries. We assessed the EBUScharacteristics across various mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathies. In thisprospective study, all patients with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on CT Chest and who were planned for EBUS-FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) were included.EBUS features of lymph nodes studied were shape, size, margins, echogenicity,central hilar structure (CHS), coagulation necrosis sign and colour power dopplerindex (CPDI). These were scored and compared between benign and malignantlymphadenopathies. A total of 86 lymph nodes in 46 patients were prospectivelystudied of which 23 (26.7%) were malignant, 27 (31.3%) tuberculosis and 36(41.8%) sarcoidosis. There was significant difference between malignant andbenign lymph nodes in terms of CHS [central hilar structutre] (p=0.011), margins (p=0.036) and coagulation necrosis sign (p<0.001). On comparison of features ofmalignancy and tuberculosis, there were significant differences in margins(p=0.016) and coagulation necrosis sign (p 0.001). However, when malignancy andsarcoidosis was compared, there were differences in echogenicity (p=0.002), CHS(p=0.009) and coagulation necrosis sign (p<0.001). Only coagulation necrosis signwas found to be highly consistent with malignant lymph nodes. The other features cannot be used to distinguish malignant from benign lymph nodes, especially in a developing country like India where tuberculosis is a common cause of mediastinallymphadenopathy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Joint Spatio-Temporal Shared Component Model with an Application in Iran Cancer Data,/pubmed/29936779,"Background: Among the proposals for joint disease mapping, the shared componentmodel has become more popular. Another advance to strengthen inference of diseasedata is the extension of purely spatial models to include time aspect. We aim to combine the idea of multivariate shared components with spatio-temporal modellingin a joint disease mapping model and apply it for incidence rates of sevenprevalent cancers in Iran which together account for approximately 50% of allcancers. Methods: In the proposed model, each component is shared by differentsubsets of diseases, spatial and temporal trends are considered for eachcomponent, and the relative weight of these trends for each component for eachrelevant disease can be estimated. Results: For esophagus and stomach cancers theNorthern provinces was the area of high risk. For colorectal cancer Gilan,Semnan, Fars, Isfahan, Yazd and East-Azerbaijan were the highest risk provinces. For bladder and lung cancer, the northwest were the highest risk area. Forprostate and breast cancers, Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Tehran, Semnan, Mazandaran and Khorasane-Razavi were the highest risk part. The smoking component, shared byesophagus, stomach, bladder and lung, had more effect in Gilan, Mazandaran,Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad, Ardebil and Tehranprovinces, in turn. For overweight and obesity component, shared by esophagus,colorectal, prostate and breast cancers the largest effect was found for Tehran, Khorasane-Razavi, Semnan, Yazd, Isfahan, Fars, Mazandaran and Gilan, in turn. Forlow physical activity component, shared by colorectal and breast cancersNorth-Khorasan, Ardebil, Golestan, Ilam, Khorasane-Razavi and South-Khorasan had the largest effects, in turn. The smoking component is significantly moreimportant for stomach than for esophagus, bladder and lung. The overweight andobesity had significantly more effect for colorectal than of esophagus cancer.Conclusions: The presented model is a valuable model to model geographical andtemporal variation among diseases and has some interesting potential features andbenefits over other joint models.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[The caregiver burden and related factors on quality of life among caregivers for patients with lung cancer].,/pubmed/29936775,"Objective: To explore the influence of caregiver burden on quality of life among caregivers for patients with lung cancer in Beijing. Methods: From August toOctober in 2017, 336 caregivers for patients with primary lung cancer from alarge tertiary hospital were recruited to this survey by convenient samplingmethod. The Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) Instruments were used to evaluate the caregiver burden and quality of life. The demographic characteristics were evaluated using Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. In addition, using the 4 dimensions of quality of lifescale as the dependent variables while the 5 dimensions of caregiver burden anddemographic variables as the explanatory variables, we conducted the multiplelinear stepwise regression analysis (the defaults were 0.15 for FORWARD andBACKWARD). Results: The scores of family caregivers' esteem, impact on schedule, impact on finances, impact on health and lack of family support were4.30±0.47_3.55±0.74_3.10±0.91_2.60±0.78_2.32±0.73, respectively. Regressionresults showed that demographic factors, including marriage, occupation andrelationship with patients and impact on health, caregivers' esteem and impact onfinances dimensions of caregiver burden were the factors which influenced thequality of life of caregivers. Conclusions: The caregiver burden in patients withlung cancer is mainly focused on impact on schedule and finances. Impact onhealth, finances and caregivers' esteem (seven items were reverse-scored) aresignificantly negatively correlated with quality of life of caregivers.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Clinical characteristics and prognostic analyses of 87 patients with pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma].,/pubmed/29936772,"Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics, therapy andprognosis of patients with pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Methods: Theclinical data of 87 patients diagnosed as pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma atThe First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from April 2011 to May 2016were retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological features were summarizedand the prognoses were analyzed. Results: Among the 87 patients with lungmucoepidermoid carcinoma, 53 were male and 34 were female, the gender ratiobetween men and women was 1.56_1.The ages of patients were from 16 to 79 yearsand the median age was 52.5 years. Seventeen cases were diagnosed as stage _, 28 cases were stage _, 26 cases were stage _, 16 cases were stage _.Thirty-sixpatients were examined by immunohistochemistry, of which 29 cases werecytokeratin (CK) 5/6 positive, 29 cases were CK7 positive, 10 cases were CKpositive, 28 cases were p63 positive, 14 cases were p40 positive, 17 cases werethyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) positive, 11 cases were NapsinA positive, 2 cases were epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positive, 4 cases were CK8/18positive, 3 cases were surfactant proteins A (SPA) positive, 1 case was CAM5.2positive and 1 case was CK14 positive. Among the 87 patients, 34 cases weretreated by operation alone, 23 cases were treated by operation combined withchemotherapy, 5 cases were treated by radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, 14cases were treated by chemotherapy alone, 2 cases were treated by particleimplantation combined with chemotherapy, 2 cases were treated by localradiofrequency hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy, and 7 cases withoutspecial treatment.Five patients with brain metastasis were treated with cerebral radiotherapy combined with sequential chemotherapy. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-yearsurvival rates of 87 patients were 90.7%, 81.6% and 46.3%, respectively. Themedian survival time was 60 months. The prognoses of patients with lungmucoepidermoid carcinoma were related with the clinical stage, smoking andoperative therapy (all P<0.05). Conclusions: The age distribution of patientswith pulmonary mucoepidermoid is a wide range, the incidence of male is higherthan that of female. The diagnosis of pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma mainlyrelies on the morphological diagnosis and the immunohistochemical detection isnon-specific. The prognoses of patients with lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma arerelated with clinical stage, smoking and operative therapy.

Methods: We retrospectively analyze 420 patients who receivedthoracic radiotherapy alone, sequential chemoraiotherapy or concurrentchemoradiotherapy for locally advanced stage NSCLC from January 2007 to December 2010 of our hospital. The patients were divided into two groups (high NLR groupand low NLR group) with appropriate cutoff point using the receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve method. The survival curve was established byKaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank test was used to compare the survival of thetwo NLR groups and the multivariate analysis was carried out by Cox regressionmodel. Results: Among the 420 patients, 99 received radiotherapy alone, 139received sequential chemoradiotherapy and 182 received concurrentchemoradiotherapy. 345 patients died and 75 were still alive. The medianfollow-up time was 5.2 years and the median overall survival was 22 months. Thecut-off value of pretreatment NLR was 2.1. The 5-year PFS and OS rates in highNLR group and low NLR group were 10.6% vs 15.7% (P=0.033) and 15.5% vs 22.7%(P=0.012). Multivariate analysis confirmed that pretreatment NLR (hazard ratio1.06, P=0.041) was independent prognostic factor of OS. Conclusions: Our studyrevealed that the pretreatment NLR is the independent prognostic factor of OS in patients with locally advanced stage NSCLC treated with thoracic radiotherapy.However, NLR is still greatly influenced by patient's condition and treatmentwhich needs further research.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[The application of conventional smears and liquid-based cytologic slides of lymphatic metastasis specimens of lung adenocarcinoma acquired by fine needle aspiration to detect the expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein].,/pubmed/29936767,"Objective: To explore the feasibility of conventional smears and liquid-basedcytologic slides of lymphatic metastasis specimens of lung adenocarcinomaacquired by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to detect the expression ofanaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK/D5F3) by immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis.Methods: The lymphatic metastasis specimens of 147 lung adenocarcinoma, including100 liquid-based cytologic slides and 47 conventional smears, were collected inthis study. ALK fusion protein was detected by Roche Ventana ICC technology,which was compared with the ALK fusion gene assessed by fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results: The positive rate of ALK (D5F3) fusion protein in advanced lungadenocarcinoma acquired by FNAC was 11.6% (17/147), and 10.6% (5/47) and 12.0%(12/100) were reached in conventional smears and liquid-based cytologic slides,respectively.Among 147 cases, 57 cases including 17 positive cases and 40negative cases were verified by RT-PCR and FISH. The whole coincidence ratereached 96.5% (55/57). The sensitivity and specificity of ALK (D5F3) fusionprotein detected in lung adenocarcinoma acquired by FNAC were 94.1% (16/17) and97.5% (39/40), respectively.

[Diagnostic value of protein markers in plasma exosomes of lung squamous cell carcinoma].,/pubmed/29936766,"Objective: To investigate the tumor-associated protein molecules carried byplasma exosomes of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma before treatmentand analyze their value as clinical markers. Methods: Exosomes from 2 patientswith lung squamous cell carcinoma before treatment and 2 healthy controls werecollected by ultracentrifugation. Proteomics was applied to analyze the proteinexpression profiles of exosomes. Candidate molecules were verified in another 30 exosomes samples from lung squamous cell carcinoma and healthy controls usingenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Electron microscopy andparticle-counting assay showed that high-quality exosomes were collected. Thenumber of exosomes distributed from 45 to 135 nm in 2 cases of lung cancerpatients were 7.89_10(11)/ml and 9.71_10(11)/ml, respectively, significantlyhigher than 2.76_10(11)/ml and 1.41_10(11)/ml in healthy controls. Proteomicanalysis showed that proteins of exosomes in lung squamous cell carcinomapatients were very different from those of healthy controls, and some proteinsare related to important functions in tumor progression. 14-3-3_ from exosomeswas selected and further verified as a marker, and the area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (ROC) was 0.68. The sensitivity and specificity of14-3-3 _ from exosomes were 60.0% and 80.0%, respectively, suggested that itcould be used as a diagnostic marker for lung squamous cell carcinoma.Conclusion: The exosome counts in plasma and the protein molecules from exosomes,such as 14-3-3_, are closely related to the tumorigenesis, which can be used toassist clinical diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Cancer Incidence in Kerman Province, Southeast of Iran: Report of an ongoing Population-Based Cancer Registry, 2014",/pubmed/29936728,"Introduction: The epidemiology of common cancers in Kerman province, southeast ofIran, was assessed based upon results of the Kerman Population-Based CancerRegistry Program (KPBCR). Methods: in this retrospective study, all patientsdiagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. Newcancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs, medicalreports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred toneighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from nationalreferral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted fromregional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registryperiodically. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-yearsfor all cancers were computed, using direct-standardization and CanRegmethodology. Mortality to incidence (M:I) ratios and microscopically verified(MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province, 2014. Of these 45. 6%involved women (n=1,293). Individuals aged 60-64 years represented the largestproportion (11.6%) of the total cancer prevalence, followed by those aged 55-59years (10.86%) and 65-69 years (8.99%).

"Chronic low dose ethanol induces an aggressive metastatic phenotype in TRAMP mice, which is counteracted by parthenolide.",/pubmed/29936575,"Despite advances in prostate cancer therapy, dissemination and growth ofmetastases results in shortened survival. Here we examined the potentialanti-cancer effect of the NF-_B inhibitor parthenolide (PTL) and its watersoluble analogue dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) on tumour progression andmetastasis in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) modelof prostate cancer. Six-week-old male TRAMP mice received PTL (40Êmg/kg in 10%ethanol/saline), DMAPT (100Êmg/kg in sterile water), or vehicle controls by oral gavage thrice weekly until palpable tumour formation. DMAPT treatment slowednormal tumour development in TRAMP mice, extending the time-to-palpable prostate tumour by 20%. PTL did not slow overall tumour development, while theethanol/saline vehicle used to administer PTL unexpectedly induced an aggressive metastatic tumour phenotype. Chronic ethanol/saline vehicle upregulatedexpression of NF-_B, MMP2, integrin _1, collagen IV, and laminin, and inducedvascular basement membrane degradation in primary prostate tumours, as well asincreased metastatic spread to the lung and liver. All of these changes werelargely prevented by co-administration with PTL. DMAPT (in water) reducedmetastasis to below that of water-control. These data suggest that DMAPT has the potential to be used as a cancer preventive and anti-metastatic therapy forprostate cancer. Although low levels of ethanol consumption have not been shownto strongly correlate with prostate cancer epidemiology, these results wouldsupport a potential effect of chronic low dose ethanol on metastasis and theTRAMP model provides a useful system in which to further explore the mechanismsinvolved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by active immunotherapy based on racotumomab in non-small cell lung cancer patients.,/pubmed/29936534,"Antitumor strategies based on positive modulation of the immune system currently represent therapeutic options with prominent acceptance for cancer patients'treatment due to its selectivity and higher tolerance compared to chemotherapy.Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype (anti-Id) monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed toNeuGc-containing gangliosides such as NeuGcGM3, a widely reported tumor-specific neoantigen in many human cancers. Racotumomab has been approved in Latin Americancountries as an active immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) treatment. In this work, we evaluated the induction of Ab-dependentcell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in NSCLC patients included in a phase IIIclinical trial, in response to vaccination with racotumomab. The development ofanti-NeuGcGM3 antibodies (Abs) in serum samples of immunized patients was firstevaluated using the NeuGcGM3-expressing X63 cells, showing that racotumomabvaccination developed antigen-specific Abs that are able to recognize NeuGcGM3expressed in tumor cell membranes. ADCC response against NeuGcGM3-expressing X63 (target) was observed in racotumomab-treated- but not in control group patients. When target cells were depleted of gangliosides by treatment with aglucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, we observed a significant reduction of theADCC activity developed by sera from racotumomab-vaccinated patients, suggesting a target-specific response.

ILD grade and progression-free survival were analyzed according to thepresence or absence of imaging findings of airway obstruction adjacent to lungtumors (IAOT).RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of ILD for patientswith a history of radiation pneumonitis or IAOT was 3.96 (p=0.012) and 6.59(p=0.004), respectively. ILD occurred in six (37.5%) out of 16 patients with IAOTand 19 (10.3%) out of 185 patients without IAOT. Three out of the six patientswith ILD and IAOT had ILD of grade 4 or more. The median progression-freesurvival of patients with and without IAOT was 0.9 and 3.2 months, respectively(p<0.001).CONCLUSION: IAOT was strongly associated with the occurrence of ILD after therapywith nivolumab.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Re-administration of Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Recovered from Chemotherapy-induced Interstitial Lung Disease.,/pubmed/29936470,"We reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinaseinhibitor re-administration (TKI-R) might be salvage therapy in patients withadvanced non-small cell lung cancer after recovery from EGFR-TKI-inducedinterstitial lung disease (ILD). Here we retrospectively evaluated whetherchemotherapy re-administration (CT-R) was effective in patients afterchemotherapy-induced ILD. After providing their informed consent due to the risk of severe ILD, five patients received CT-R and six received TKI-R with oraladministration of 0.5 mg/kg prednisolone. The overall survival (OS) from theoccurrence of drug-induced ILD was shorter in CT-R cases than that in TKI-R cases(7.3 months vs. 25.4 months, p=0.003). The median duration of OS, however, was7.3 months in cases with CT-R and 1.9 months in cases without CT-R. Multivariate analysis showed that CT-R as well as TKI-R tended to reduce the risk ofmortality. CT-R might be salvage therapy in such patients, although the benefitof CT-R was smaller than that of TKI-R.",RCT,,,,Chemotherapy re administration,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor re administration,,,Advanced non small cell lung cancer,Overall survival,
Effect of Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin on the Antioxidant Status and Lung Function of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,/pubmed/29936455,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Evidence exists that oxidative stress and oxidative damage play apivotal role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oligomericproanthocyanidins (OPCs) extracted from grape seeds have been shown to exhibitantioxidant capabilities greater than those of vitamin C and E. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of OPCs on antioxidant status and lungfunction in patients with COPD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were supplemented with 150 mg/day OPC (n=13)orally or with a placebo (n=14) for 8 weeks in a randomized double-blind clinicaldesign. Changes in anthropometric values, lung function, oxidative state, andlipid profiles were assessed after OPC or placebo treatment for 8 weeks.RESULTS: The results showed that OPC supplementation significantly reduced theconcentration of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and total cholesterol(TC)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio. The concentration ofHDL-C significantly increased in the OPC-treated group. The plasma triglyceride, TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values and the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase also decreased, but did not significantly differbetween the OPC- and placebo-treated groups. Lung function was not significantly different between the two groups after 8 weeks.CONCLUSION: OPC supplementation was effective in increasing the antioxidantcapacity, in addition to improving the lipid profiles in patients with COPD.",RCT,,,,Oligomeric proanthocyanidins,Placebo,,,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Changes in anthropometric values, lung function, oxidative state, and lipid profiles",
Redox- and pH-responsive nanoparticles release piperlongumine in a stimuli-sensitive manner to inhibit pulmonary metastasis of colorectal carcinoma cells.,/pubmed/29936202,"Redox-responsive nanoparticles having a diselenide linkage were synthesized totarget pulmonary metastasis of cancer cells. Methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol)-grafted chitosan (ChitoPEG) was crosslinked using selenocystine-acetylhistidine (Ac-histidine) conjugates (ChitoPEGse) for stimuli-responsive delivery of piperlongumine (PL). ChitoPEGse nanoparticles swelled in an acidic environmentand became partially disintegrated in the presence of H2O2, resulting in anincrease of particle size and in a size distribution having multimodal pattern.PL release increased under acidic conditions and in the presence of H2O2. Uptake of ChitoPEGse nanoparticles by CT26 cells significantly increased in acidic andredox state. PL-incorporated ChitoPEGse nanoparticles (PL NP) showed similaranticancer activity in vitro against A549 and CT26 cells compared to PL itself.PL NP showed superior anticancer and anti-metastatic activity in an in vivo CT26 cell pulmonary metastasis mouse model. Further, an immunofluorescence imagingstudy demonstrated that PL NP conjugates were specifically delivered to the tumormass in the lung. Conclusively, ChitoPEGse nanoparticles were able to bedelivered to cancer cells with an acidic- or redox state-sensitive manner andthen efficiently targeted pulmonary metastasis of cancer cells since ChitoPEGsenanoparticles have dual pH- and redox-responsiveness.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Is it safe and practical to use a Foley catheter as a chest tube for lung cancer patients after lobectomy? A prospective cohort study with 441 cases.,/pubmed/29936194,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to explore the feasibility and safety ofpostoperative chest drainage with a Foley catheter for lung cancer patientsundergoing a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy.METHODS: Data from lung cancer patients who underwent a VATS lobectomy withinsertion of a catheter (Foley catheter or 28-F chest tube) were analysed. Atotal of 441 patients were included preoperatively for participation, with 208patients in the Foley catheter group and 233 in the 28-F group.RESULTS: In the Foley catheter group, a shorter mean number of days was required until chest tube removal after lobectomy (2.6±1.3 vs. 3.5±2.0_d, P<0.001) andpostoperative length of stay was shorter (3.8±2.5 vs. 5.2±4.1_d, P<0.001); The28-F group had a higher average VAS score than did the Foley catheter group at6_h (P=0.025), and 48_h (P<0.001) after VATS lobectomy as well as at 6_h, 24_h,48_h, 72_h, 30 days and 90 days after chest tube removal (P<0.001). Regardingpostoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and chest tube removal-relatedcomplications, the rate of PPCs was not found to be significant, and asignificantly higher proportion of disordered wound healing at the drainage site was observed in the 28-F group (5.8%, 12/208 vs. 11.6%, 27/233; P=0.043).CONCLUSION: The study indicated that placement of Foley catheter vs. 28-F chesttube was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modestreduction in pain, with shorter mean days until chest tube removal afterlobectomy, shorter in-hospital stay, and a smaller proportion of disordered woundhealing at the drainage site.

Effect of perioperative lidocaine on metastasis after sevoflurane or ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia for breast tumour resection in a murine model.,/pubmed/29935598,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer accounts for 7% of female cancer deaths, usuallyattributable to metastasis. While surgery is a mainstay of treatment,perioperative interventions may influence risk of metastasis during breast tumourresection. Amide local anaesthetics influence cancer cell biology via numerousmechanisms inÊvitro, but inÊvivo data is lacking. We aimed to test the hypothesisthat perioperative lidocaine reduces pulmonary metastasis after inhalation andi.v. anaesthesia in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model.METHODS: 4T1 Cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat-pad ofimmunocompetent BALB/c female mice. After 7 days, the resultant tumour wasexcised under either sevoflurane or ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia with or withoutperioperative i.v. lidocaine (1.5 mg kg-1 bolus followed by 25 min infusion 2 mg kg-1 h-1). Fourteen days post-surgery, posthumous lung and liver specimens wereexamined for metastasis. Pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic cytokines wereprofiled in post-mortem serum from a small number of the mice.RESULTS: Primary tumour diameter was similar between groups. Lidocaine reducedlung metastatic colony count vs sevoflurane alone; median (inter-quartile range) 0 (0-2) compared with 22.5 (0-481), P=0.02 and reduced the proportion of animals with pulmonary metastasis (28.5% compared with 52.5%, P=0.04). In mice receiving ketamine-xylazine, lidocaine did not decrease the overall colony count: 60(26-123) compared with 23.5 (0-225), P=0.43, but increased the proportion ofanimals with pulmonary metastasis (100% compared with 50%, P<0.01). Post-mortemserum analysis demonstrated reduced pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokineexpression in animals without metastasis which received lidocaine withsevoflurane.CONCLUSIONS: In this 4T1 murine model of breast cancer, lidocaine decreasedpulmonary metastasis when combined with sevoflurane anaesthesia, perhaps viaanti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects. It had no such effect in micegiven ketamine anaesthesia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of beta-blockers on cancer recurrence and survival: a meta-analysis of epidemiological and perioperative studies.,/pubmed/29935594,"BACKGROUND: The biological perturbation associated with psychological andsurgical stress is implicated in cancer recurrence. Preclinical evidence suggeststhat beta-blockers can be protective against cancer progression. We undertook ameta-analysis of epidemiological and perioperative clinical studies toinvestigate the association between beta-blocker use and cancer recurrence (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).METHODS: Databases were searched until September 2017, reported hazard ratios(HRs) pooled, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Comparative studies examining the effect of beta-blockers (selective and non-selective) on canceroutcomes were included. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assessmethodological quality and bias.RESULTS: Of the 27 included studies, nine evaluated the incidental use ofnon-selective beta-blockers, and ten were perioperative studies. Beta-blocker usehad no effect on CR. Within subgroups of cancer, melanoma was associated withimproved DFS (HR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.17) and OS (HR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00-0.38),while endometrial cancer had an associated reduction in DFS (HR 1.40, 95% CI1.10-1.80) and OS (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12-2.00). There was also reduced OS seenwith head and neck and prostate cancer. Non-selective beta-blocker use wasassociated with improved DFS and OS in ovarian cancer, improved DFS in melanoma, but reduced OS in lung cancer. Perioperative studies showed similar variableeffects across cancer types, albeit from a limited data pool.CONCLUSION: Beta-blocker use had no evident effect on CR. The beneficial effectof beta-blockers on DFS and OS in the epidemiological or perioperative settingremains variable, tumour-specific, and of low-level evidence at present.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Small size fullerenol nanoparticles suppress lung metastasis of breast cancer cell by disrupting actin dynamics.,/pubmed/29935539,"BACKGROUND: Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in cancerpatients. Migratory breast cancer cells in lymphatic and blood vessels seek newsites and form metastatic colonies in the lung and bone, and then these cancercells often wreak considerable havoc. With advances in nanotechnology,nanomaterials and nanotechnologies are widely applied in tumor therapy. In thispaper, small size fullerenol nanoparticles, which are separated by isoelectricfocusing electrophoresis (IFE) for discrepancy of isoelectric point (pI), areused in the study of tumor metastasis.RESULTS: In this study, the commendable inhibition of tumor metastasis wasuncovered by intravenous injection of purified fullerenol fraction with specialsurface charge and functional groups, which was separated by IFE for discrepancy of pI. By investigating the actin dynamics in several cancer cell lines, we foundthese small size fullerenol nanoparticles disturbed actin dynamics. Young'smodulus detection and cell migration assays revealed that fullerenol loweredstiffness and restrained migration of breast cancer cells. Filopodia, the mainsupporting structures of actin bundles, are important for cell motility andadhesion. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fullerenol reduced the number and length of filopodia. Simultaneously, the inhibition of integrin to formclusters on filopodias, which was likely induced by reorganizing of actincytoskeleton, impacted cancer cell adhesion and motility.CONCLUSIONS: With intravenous injection of these fullerenol nanoparticles, tumor metastasis is well inhibited in vivo. The underlying mechanism most likely to be attributed to the effect of fullerenol nanoparticles on disturbing actindynamics. With the disordered actin fiber, cell function is varied, includingdecreased cell stiffness, reduced filopodia formation, and inactivated integrin.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"High collagen density augments mTOR-dependent cancer stem cells in ERë±+ mammary carcinomas, and increases mTOR-independent lung metastases.",/pubmed/29935374,"Metastatic estrogen receptor alpha positive (ER_+) cancers account for mostbreast cancer mortality. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) and dense/stiff extracellularmatrices are implicated in aggression and therapy resistance. We examined thisinterplay and response to mTOR inhibition using ER_+ adenocarcinomas from NRL-PRLfemales in combination with Col1a1tmJae/+ (mCol1a1) mice, which accumulatecollagen-I around growing tumors. Orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells tomCol1a1 but not wildtype hosts resulted in striking desmoplasia. Mammary tumorsin mCol1a1 recipients displayed higher CSC activity and enhanced AKT-mTOR and YAPactivation, and these animals developed more and larger lung metastases.Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, with or without the anti-estrogen, ICI182780, rapidly diminished mammary tumors, which rapidly reversed whentreatment ceased. In contrast, lung metastases, which exhibited lowerproliferation and pS6RP, indicating lower mTOR activity, were unresponsive, andmCol1a1 hosts continued to sustain greater metastatic burdens. These findingsshed light on the influence of desmoplastic tumor microenvironments on the CSCniche and metastatic behavior in ER_+ breast cancer. The differential mTORdependence of local mammary tumors and pulmonary lesions has implications forsuccess of mTOR inhibitors in advanced ER_+ disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Lower miR-340 expression predicts poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and promotes cell proliferation by targeting CDK4.,/pubmed/29935356,"Aberrantly microRNAs (miRs) expression is reported to be involved intumorigenesis and development in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MiR-340 had been identified to be downregulated in NSCLC in the previous study. However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-340 involved in NSCLC progression still needed to bewell known. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-340 expression wasnotably down-regulated in NSCLC tissues compared to matched adjacent noncancerouslung tissues by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. Lower miR-340expression positively related to lymph node metastasis, larger tumor size,advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro assays, wedemonstrated that upregulation of miR-340 expression suppressed cellproliferation ability. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assaysrevealed that miR-340 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated (3'UTR) region ofCDK4 mRNA. Over-expression of miR-340 suppressed cell proliferation by regulatingCDK4 expression in NSCLC cells. Additionally, we showed that increased miR-340expression promoted the expression of cell proliferation related protein CDK6expression, but decreasing the P15 and P21 expression. In vivo, we verified that miR-340 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth by regulating CDK4 expression.Therefore, these findings revealed miR-340 functions as a tumor suppressor inNSCLC cells and may provide a potential target of NSCLC treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of molecular testing modalities for detection of ROS1 rearrangements in a cohort of positive patient samples.,/pubmed/29935306,"INTRODUCTION: ROS1 gene fusions are a well-characterized class of oncogenicdriver found in approximately 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancer patients.ROS1-directed therapy in these patients is more efficacious and is associatedwith fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy and is thus now consideredstandard-of-care for patients with advanced disease. Consequently, accuratedetection of ROS1 rearrangements/fusions in clinical tumor samples is vital. Inthis study, we compared the performance of three common molecular testingapproaches on a cohort of ROS1 rearrangement/fusion-positive patient samples.METHODS: Twenty-three ROS1 rearrangement/fusion-positive clinical samples wereassessed by at least two of the following molecular testing methodologies:break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA-based hybrid capturelibrary preparation followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and RNA-basedanchored multiplex PCR library preparation followed by NGS.RESULTS: None of the testing methodologies demonstrated 100% sensitivity indetection of ROS1 rearrangements/fusions. FISH results were negative in 2 out of 20 tested samples, the DNA-based NGS assay was negative in 4 out of 18 testedsamples, and the RNA-based NGS assay was negative in 3 of 19 tested samples. For all three testing approaches, we identified assay characteristics that likelycontributed to false-negative results. Additionally, we report that genomicbreakpoints are an unreliable predictor of breakpoints at the transcript level,likely due to alternative splicing.CONCLUSIONS: ROS1 rearrangement/fusion detection in the clinical setting iscomplex and all methodologies have inherent limitations of which users must beaware in order to correctly interpret results.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Brief report: Early use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab.,/pubmed/29935305,"BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitors augment the immune system's naturalsurveillance mechanisms and have increasing applications in non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC). Immunosuppressive corticosteroids are also frequently used inthis population to treat unwanted inflammation. Based on this mechanisticopposition, we investigated the interaction between nivolumab and corticosteroidsin patients with advanced NSCLC.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 210 NSCLC patients treated withnivolumab at the Cleveland Clinic was performed. Use of systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to >10 mg prednisone per day) during nivolumab therapy was associatedwith objective outcomes of number of nivolumab cycles and overall survival.RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (31%) received concurrent systemic corticosteroidsduring nivolumab therapy. The most common indications included sequelae fromactive or treated brain metastases (27%) and COPD or other respiratory disease(21%). For patients with early exposure to steroids within the first 30 days ofnivolumab therapy (12%, n=25), the median number of nivolumab cycles was two,compared to five cycles in patients not exposed to corticosteroids (p=0.002).Median overall survival for patients on steroids during the first 30 days was 4.3months, compared to 11 months for patients not on steroids, hazard ratio fordeath 2.30 (95% CI 1.27-4.16, p=0.006) in multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab wereprescribed concurrent corticosteroids during the course of nivolumab therapy.Patients exposed to corticosteroids during the first cycle of nivolumab received fewer total cycles of nivolumab, suggesting decreased clinical benefit, and hadshorter overall survival.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Brigatinib in Patients with Alectinib-Refractory ALK-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Study.,/pubmed/29935304,"BACKGROUND: The second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib recently demonstratedsuperior efficacy compared to the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib inadvanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), establishing alectinib as the new standard first-line therapy.Brigatinib, another second-generation ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated substantialactivity in patients with crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC; however, its activity in the alectinib-refractory setting is unknown.METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective study was performed at three institutions. Patients were eligible if they had advanced, alectinib-refractory ALK-positiveNSCLC and were treated with brigatinib. Medical records were reviewed todetermine clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were eligible for this study. Confirmed objectiveresponses to brigatinib were observed in 3 of 18 patients (17%) with measurabledisease. Nine patients (50%) had stable disease on brigatinib. The medianprogression-free survival was 4.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-5.6months] with a median duration of treatment of 5.7 months (95% CI, 1.8-6.2months). Among nine patients in this study who underwentpost-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsies, five had an ALK I1171X or V1180Lresistance mutation; of these, one had a confirmed partial response and three hadstable disease on brigatinib. One patient had an ALK G1202R mutation in apost-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsy, and had progressive disease as the bestoverall response to brigatinib.CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib has limited clinical activity in alectinib-refractoryALK-positive NSCLC.

Comparison of Risk Stratification Models to Predict Recurrence and Survival in Pleuropulmonary Solitary Fibrous Tumor.,/pubmed/29935303,"INTRODUCTION: Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms. Most follow a benign course, but a subset will recur or metastasize. Various riskstratification schemes have been proposed for SFT, but none have been universallyendorsed and few have focused on pleuropulmonary SFT.METHODS: Histologic sections were examined from surgically resectedpleuropulmonary SFT, with confirmatory immunohistochemistry. Patients were riskstratified using 4 prediction models as proposed by de Perrot, Demicco (original and modified), and Tapias. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The 147 study patients included 78 females (53.1%), with a median age of61.5 years (range 25-87). Median follow up was 5.5 years (range 0-33). Recurrenceor metastasis occurred in 15 patients (10.2%), with 5 deaths from disease.Significant predictors of worse OS included male gender, age ³ 55, size³10 cm,non-pedunculated growth, severe atypia, necrosis, and mitoses ³ 4/10 high poweredfields (hpf). Predictors of recurrence included size ³10 cm, severe atypia,necrosis, ³4 mitosis/10 hpf, and Ki-67 ³2%. All systems predicted PFS, but onlyDemicco and Tapias significantly predicted OS. The modified Demicco systemprovided the best discrimination for PFS (C-statistic=0.80 compared to 0.78).CONCLUSION: Risk scoring systems proposed by Tapias and Demicco were bothpredictive of OS and PFS. The Demicco system has the advantages of simplicity andapplicability to SFTs from other sites, as well as providing best discrimination for PFS, and thus may be the best system to apply in general practice.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MicroRNA-206 suppresses TGF-ë_ signalling to limit tumor growth and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma.,/pubmed/29935234,"MicroRNA-206 (miR-206) has demonstrated tumor suppressive effects in a variety ofcancers. Numerous studies have identified aberrantly expressed targets of miR-206that contribute to tumor progression and metastasis, however, the broadergene-networks and pathways regulated by miR-206 remain poorly defined. Here, wehave ectopically expressed miR-206 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumorsto identify differentially expressed genes, and study the effects on tumor growthand metastasis. In H1299 tumor xenograft assays, stable expression of miR-206suppressed both tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Profiling of xenografttumors using small RNA sequencing and a targeted panel of tumor progression andmetastasis-related genes revealed a network of genes involved in TGF-_ signallingthat were regulated by miR-206. Among these were the TGFB1 ligand, as well asdirect transcriptional targets of Smad3. Other differentially expressed genesincluded components of the extracellular matrix involved in TGF-_ activation and signalling, including Thrombospondin-1, which is responsible for the activationof latent TGF-_ in the stroma. In cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells treated withrecombinant TGF-_, ectopic expression of miR-206 impaired canonical signalling,and expression of TGF-_ target genes linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition.This was due at least in part to the suppression of Smad3 protein levels in lung adenocarcinoma cells with ectopic miR-206 expression. Together, these findingsindicate that miR-206 can suppress tumor progression and metastasis by limitingautocrine production of TGF-_, and highlight the potential utility of TGF-_inhibitors for the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Glypican 3 Overexpression across a Broad Spectrum of Tumor Types Discovered with Functional Genomic mRNA Profiling of a Large Cancer Database.,/pubmed/29935166,"Glypican 3 (GPC3), a membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycan, isoverexpressed in _70% to 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), but uncommonly expressed in healthy tissues. This raised interest in GPC3 as drug target, andseveral GPC3-targeting drugs are in clinical development. We therefore predicted GPC3 protein overexpression across tumors and validated these predictions.Functional genomic mRNA profiling was applied to expression profiles of 18,055patient-derived tumor samples to predict GPC3 overexpression at the protein levelin 60 tumor types and subtypes using healthy tissues as reference. Forvalidation, predictions were compared with i) immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a breast cancer tissue microarray and ii) literature data reporting IHC GPC3overexpression in various solid, hematological, and pediatric tumors. Thepercentage of samples with predicted GPC3 overexpression was 77% for HCCs (n =364), 45% for squamous cell lung cancers (n = 405), and 19% for head and necksquamous cell cancers (n = 344). Breast cancer tissue microarray analysis showed GPC3 expression ranging from 12% to 17% in subgroups based on ER and HER2receptor status. In 28 out 34 tumor types for which functional genomic mRNA data could be compared with IHC there was a relative difference of ²10%.

"A Novel Long Noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LL22NC03-N64E9.1, Promotes the Proliferation of Lung Cancer Cells and is a Potential Prognostic Molecular Biomarker for Lung Cancer.",/pubmed/29935018,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of a novellong noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LL22NC03-N64E9.1, and its effect on the phenotype oflung cancer cells and tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencingdata and other publicly available profiling data. MATERIAL AND METHODS The lungcancer dataset GSE30219 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)repository. Differentially expressed lncRNA, LL22NC03-N64E9.1, in 48 lung cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal lung tissues, normal lung cell lines BEAS-2Band A549, and lung cancer cell lines, H1703, and H292, were detected byquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR).Interference efficiency was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Tumor levels of lncRNA, LL22NC03-N64E9.1, and clinicopathological parameters werestatistically analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of the GSE30219 test cohort showed that lncRNA, LL22NC03-N64E9.1 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer.In clinical tissue samples, the level of LL22NC03-N64E9.1 in patients with lungcancer was significantly increased compared with adjacent normal lung tissues(P<0.001). The level of LL22NC03-N64E9.1 in patients with lung cancer wassignificantly correlated with tumor size and TNM stage (P<0.05), but not withage, sex and the presence of lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). In the H292 cells,following knockdown of LL22NC03-N64E9.1, cell proliferation and cloning werereduced. CONCLUSIONS Expression of lncRNA, LL22NC03-N64E9.1, promotedproliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro, was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and was associated with increased overall survival (OS), tumor size, and tumor stage in patients with lung cancer.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Expression ratio of the TGFë_-inducible gene MYO10 is prognostic for overall survival of squamous cell lung cancer patients and predicts chemotherapy response.,/pubmed/29934580,"In lung cancer a deregulation of Transforming Growth Factor-_ (TGF_) signalinghas been observed. Yet, the impact of TGF_ in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung(LUSC) remained to be determined. We combined phenotypic and transcriptome-widestudies and showed that the stimulation of the LUSC cell line SK-MES1 with TGF_results in an increase of migratory invasive properties. The analysis of thedynamics of gene expression by next-generation sequencing revealed that TGF_stimulation orchestrates the upregulation of numerous motility- and actincytoskeleton-related genes. Among these the non-muscle myosin 10 (MYO10) showedthe highest upregulation in a LUSC patient cohort of the Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA). Knockdown of MYO10 abrogated TGF_-induced collagen gel invasion ofSK-MES1 cells. The analysis of MYO10 mRNA expression in paired tissues of 151LUSC patients with corresponding 80-month clinical follow-up data showed that themRNA expression ratio of MYO10 in tumor and tumor-free tissue is prognostic foroverall survival of LUSC patients and predictive for the response of thesepatients to adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, MYO10 represents a new clinicalbiomarker for this aggressive disease and due to its role in cellular motilityand invasion could serve as a potential molecular target for therapeuticinterventions in patients with LUSC.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were further categorized into responders andnonresponders, and predictive factors of treatment response were determined.RESULTS: The objective response rate was 57% in the irAE group versus 12% in the non-irAE group. Median progression-free survival was 12.0 months in the irAEversus 3.6 months in the non-irAE group. The incidence of both irAEs andpre-existing antithyroid antibody was significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders. Multivariate analysis identified incidence of irAEs andpre-existing antithyroid antibody as an independent predictor of treatmentresponse.CONCLUSION: Objective response rate and progression-free survival weresignificantly better in the irAE than in the non-irAE group in patients withadvanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab monotherapy. The development of irAEs wasassociated with clinical efficacy, and the presence of pre-existing antithyroidantibody might be correlated with treatment response to nivolumab monotherapy.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are frequentlyobserved with nivolumab monotherapy. This study evaluted whether the development of irAEs correlates with treatment response in advanced non-small-cell lungcancer. Results showed that the objective response rate and progression-freesurvival were significantly better in the patients who developed irAEs than inthe patients who did not develop irAEs, and the incidence of irAEs and positivityfor antithyroid antibody at pretreatment were independent predictors of treatmentresponse of nivolumab monotherapy. Therefore, the development of irAEs predictsclinical benefit and suggests that cautious management of irAEs can lead toachieving maximum clinical benefit from nivolumab monotherapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Validation of EGFL6 expression as a prognostic marker in patients with lung adenocarcinoma in Taiwan: a retrospective study.,/pubmed/29934389,"OBJECTIVE: Lung adenocarcinoma is a non-small cell lung cancer, a common cancerin both genders, and has poor clinical outcome. Our aim was to evaluate the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain multiple 6 (EGFL6) and itsprognostic significance in lung adenocarcinoma.METHODS: EGFL6 expression was studied by immunohistochemical staining ofspecimens from 150 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The correlation betweenclinicopathological features and EGFL6 expression was quantitatively analysed. Weused Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models to examine theprognostic value of EGFL6 in terms of overall survival.RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between EGFL6 expression andclinical parameters. However, patients with high levels of EGFL6 expressionshowed a tendency towards poor prognosis, with borderline statisticalsignificance. Grouping the patients according to a medium age value revealed asignificant association between high EGFL6 expression and poor clinical outcomein young patients. This finding was further confirmed by grouping the patientsinto three groups according to age. HR in patients with high EGFL6 expression washigher in younger patients than in older patients.CONCLUSION: High EGFL6 expression may serve as a marker for poor prognosis oflung adenocarcinoma, especially in younger patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Role of RNF20 in cancer development and progression- a comprehensive review.,/pubmed/29934362,"Evolving strategies to counter cancer initiation and progression rely on theidentification of novel therapeutic targets that exploit the aberrant geneticchanges driving oncogenesis. Several chromatin associated enzymes have been shownto influence post-translational modification on DNA, histones, and non-histoneproteins. Any deregulation of this core group of enzymes often leads to cancerdevelopment. Ubiquitylation of histone H2B in mammalian cells was identified overthree decades ago. An exciting really interesting new gene (RING) family of E3ubiquitin ligases, known as RNF20 and RNF40, monoubiquitinates histone H2A atK119 or H2B at K120 and is known to function in transcription elongation, DNAdouble strand break repair processes, maintenance of chromatin differentiation,and exerting tumor suppressor activity. RNF20 is somatically altered in breast,lung, prostate cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and mixed lineageleukemia, and its reduced expression is a key factor in initiating genomeinstability; and it also functions as a one of the significant driving factors ofoncogenesis. Loss of RNF20/40 and H2Bub1 is found in several cancers and islinked to an aggressive phenotype, and is also an indicator of poor prognosis. Inthis review we summarize the current knowledge of RNF20 in chronicinflammation-driven cancers, DNA double strand breaks, and apoptosis, and itsimpact on chromatin structure beyond the single nucleosome level.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Hypoxia Promotes Resistance to EGFR Inhibition in NSCLC Cells via the Histone Demethylases, LSD1 and PLU-1.",/pubmed/29934325,"The development of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) specific for epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) with activating mutations has led to a new paradigm in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.However, most patients eventually develop resistance. Hypoxia is a keymicro-environmental stress in solid tumors that is associated with poor prognosisdue, in part, to acquired resistance to conventional therapy. This study,documents that long-term, moderate hypoxia promotes resistance to the EGFR TKI,gefitinib, in the NSCLC cell line, HCC827, which harbors an activating EGFRmutation. Following hypoxic growth conditions, HCC827 cells treated withgefitinib upregulated N-cadherin, Fibronectin and Vimentin expression anddownregulated E-cadherin, characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which prior studies have linked to EGFR TKI resistance. Mechanistically,knockdown of the histone demethylases, LSD1 and PLU-1, prevented and reversedhypoxia-induced gefitinib resistance, with inhibition of the associated EMT,suggesting that LSD1 and PLU-1 play key roles in hypoxia-induced gefitinibresistance and EMT. Moreover, hypoxia-treated HCC827 cells demonstrated moreaggressive tumor growth in vivo compared to cells grown in normoxia, butinhibition of LSD1 function by shRNA-mediated knockdown or by the small-molecularinhibitor, SP2509, suppressed tumor growth and enhanced gefitinib response invivo. These results suggest that hypoxia is a driving force for acquiredresistance to EGFR TKIs through epigenetic change and coordination of EMT inNSCLC.IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that combination therapy with EGFR TKIsand LSD1 inhibitor may offer an attractive therapeutic strategy for NSCLCs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Making the Evidentiary Case for Universal Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncologic Care.,/pubmed/29934139,"The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the state of the evidencefor, and challenges to, sustainable implementation of multidisciplinary thoracic oncology programs. Multidisciplinary care is much advocated by professionalgroups and makers of clinical guidelines, but little practiced. The gap betweenuniversal recommendation and scant evidence of practice suggests the existence ofmajor barriers to program implementation. We examine 2 articles published in thisissue of Clinical Lung Cancer to illustrate problems with the evidence base formultidisciplinary care. The inherent complexity of care delivery for the lungcancer patient drives near-universal advocacy for multidisciplinary care as ameans of overcoming the heterogeneous quality and outcomes of patient care.However, the evidence to support this model of care delivery is poor. Challenges include the absence of a clear definition of ""multidisciplinary care"" in theliterature, a consequent hodge-podge of poorly-defined examples of tested models,methodologically flawed studies, exemplified by the near-total absence ofprospective studies examining this model of care delivery, and absence ofscientifically sound dissemination and implementation studies, as well ascost-effectiveness studies. Against this background, we examined the results of arecent large single-institutional retrospective study suggesting the survivalbenefit of care within a colocated multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic, and anambitious systematic review of existing literature on multidisciplinary cancerclinics. Better-quality evidence is still needed to establish the value of themultidisciplinary care concept. Such studies need to be prospective, usestandardized definitions of multidisciplinary care, and provide clear informationabout program structure.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cardiac mortality in limited-stage small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29934110,"INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy of patients with limited-stage small cell lungcancer (LS-SCLC) continues to rise; thus, characterization of long-termtoxicities is essential. Although there are emerging data linking cardiacirradiation doses with survival for non-small cell lung cancer, there arecurrently minimal data on cardiac-specific mortality (CSM) in LS-SCLC. The goalof this investigation was to evaluate CSM between left- and right-sided cases.METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried forstage I-III primary SCLC patients receiving radiotherapy; CSM was comparedbetween left- and right-sided diseases. Accounting for mortality from othercauses, Gray's test compared cumulative incidences of CSM between both groups.Multiple multivariate models examined the independent effect of laterality onCSM, including the Fine and Gray competing risk model and the Cox proportionalhazards model.RESULTS: Of 19,692 patients, 7991 (41%) were left-sided and 11,701 (59%) wereright-sided. Left-sided patients experienced significantly higher CSM overall(3.3% vs. 2.6%, p_=_0.004). Laterality was an independent predictor of CSM in theoverall population in the Fine and Gray competing risk model (p_=_0.006) as well as the Cox proportional hazards model (p_=_0.007). The overall hazard ratio forCSM by disease laterality was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.50).Laterality had no statistical association with non-cardiac mortality in the Fine and Gray competing risk model (p_=_0.130).CONCLUSIONS: Although causation between radiotherapy and CSM in LS-SCLC cannot bestated based on these data, we encourage clinical attentiveness tocardiac-sparing radiotherapy for LS-SCLC, along with further investigationevaluating dosimetric correlates for cardiotoxicity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Estimating the need for palliative radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: A criterion-based benchmarking approach.,/pubmed/29934108,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estimates of appropriate treatment rates are required formonitoring and improving access to cancer care. Optimal utilization rates forpalliative radiotherapy (PRT) for patients with non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) remain undefined. We aim to estimate the appropriate PRT rate for thegeneral NSCLC population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ontario's population-based cancer registry identifiedpatients with NSCLC who died of their disease between 2006 and 2010. Multivariateanalysis identified factors affecting PRT use, enabling us to define a benchmark population with unimpeded access to PRT. Proportion of cases treated in the last 2_years of life (PRT2y) was standardized to overall population characteristics.Benchmarks were compared to province-wide PRT2y rates.RESULTS: Availability of RT at the diagnosing hospital was the dominantdeterminant of increased PRT utilization. Patients diagnosed at hospitals with onsite RT were therefore designated the benchmark population. The standardizedbenchmark for PRT2y was 56%, compared to the province-wide rate of 49%. The gapbetween actual and optimal rates varied across patient ages, treatmentindications, and geographic regions.CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 56% of patients who die of NSCLC in Ontario need PRT, but many are never treated.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Use of PET and Other Functional Imaging to Guide Target Delineation in Radiation Oncology.,/pubmed/29933876,"Molecular and functional imaging is increasingly being used to guide radiotherapy(RT) management and target delineation. This review summarizes existing data inseveral disease sites of various functional imaging modalities, chiefly positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), with respect to RT targetdefinition and management. For gliomas, differentiation between postoperativechanges and viable tumor is discussed, as well as focal dose escalation andreirradiation. Head and neck neoplasms may also benefit from precise PET/CT-basedtarget delineation, especially for cancers of unknown primary; focal doseescalation is also described. In lung cancer, PET/CT can influence coverage oftumor volumes, dose escalation, and adaptive management. For cervical cancer,PET/CT as an adjunct to magnetic resonance imaging planning is discussed, as are dose escalation and delineation of avoidance targets such as the bone marrow. Theemerging role of choline-based PET for prostate cancer and its impact on doseescalation is also described. Lastly, given the essential role of PET/CT fortarget definition in lymphoma, phase III trials of PET-directed management arereviewed, along with novel imaging modalities. Taken together, molecular andfunctional imaging approaches offer a major step to individualizeradiotherapeutic care going forward.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Ethyl Acetate Extract of Scindapsus cf. hederaceus Exerts the Inhibitory Bioactivity on Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells through Modulating ER Stress.,/pubmed/29933620,"Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cytoprotective mechanism that alleviates theprotein-folding burden in eukaryotic organisms. Moderate activation of UPR isrequired for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and profoundlycontributes to tumorigenesis. Defects in UPR signaling are implicated in theattenuation of various malignant phenotypes including cell proliferation,migration, and invasion, as well as angiogenesis. This suggests UPR as apromising target in cancer therapy. The pharmacological effects of the plantScindapsus cf. hederaceus on human cancer cell lines is not understood. In thisstudy, we identified an ethyl acetate extract from Scindapsus cf. hederaceus(SH-EAE), which markedly altered the protein expression of UPR-related genes inhuman non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Treatment with the SH-EAE led to the dose-dependent suppression of colony forming ability of both H1299 and H460cells, but not markedly in normal bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. SH-EAEtreatment also attenuated the migration and invasion ability of H1299 and H460cells. Moreover, SH-EAE strikingly suppressed the protein expression of two ERstress sensors, including inositol requiring enzyme-1&alpha; (IRE-1&alpha;) andprotein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), and antagonized the induction of C/EBPhomologous protein (CHOP) expression by thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer.SH-EAE induced the formation of massive vacuoles which are probably derived from ER. Importantly, SH-EAE impaired the formation of intersegmental vessels (ISV) inzebrafish larvae, an index of angiogenesis, but had no apparent effect on therate of larval development. Together, our findings demonstrate, for the firsttime, that the ability of SH-EAE specifically targets the two sensors of UPR,with significant anti-proliferation and anti-migration activities as a crudeextract in human NSCLC cells. Our finding also indicates potential applicationsof SH-EAE in preventing UPR activation in response to Tg-induced ER stress. Wesuggest that SH-EAE attenuates UPR adaptive pathways for rendering the NSCLCcells intolerant to ER stress.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Lung Resection after Definitive and Neo-Adjuvant Chemoradiation for Stage IIIA/B Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: a Retrospective Analysis].,/pubmed/29933483,"BACKGROUND: The outcomes of so called ""salvage"" resections after definitivechemoradiation vs. curative resections after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy(IT-resection) in patients with stage IIIA/B locally advanced non-small cell lungcancer have rarely been compared. The aim of our study was to compareperioperative results, postoperative and recurrence-free survival and to identifyrelevant prognostic survival factors for both therapy strategies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2008 and May 2017, 43 patients underwentpulmonary resection following induction therapy (group 1) and 14 patientsunderwent salvage resection after definitive chemoradiation (group 2).Retrospective analysis was performed of demographic factors, tumour stage andlocation, initial therapy, preoperative regression status, perioperativemorbidity and mortality, postoperative and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: In group 2, significantly higher radiation dose was applied (p_<_0.001) and the interval between chemoradiation and lung resection was significantlylonger (p_=_0.02). In addition, significantly higher perioperative blood loss andmore frequent blood transfusions were noted (p_=_0.003 and 0.005, respectively). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were statistically comparable in the twogroups (p_=_0.72 and 0.395, respectively). Postoperative 5 year survival in group1 was 55%, in group 2 48% (log-rank p_=_0.353). Five year recurrence-freesurvival in group 1 was 53%, in group 2 42% (log-rank p_=_0.180). Diffusemetastasis occurred mostly in group 2, whereas in group 1 oligometastasis wasmore frequently noted.CONCLUSION: Postoperative outcome after salvage resection seems statisticallycomparable to results following curative resection after induction therapy.Diffuse distant metastasis is frequently noted.

Innate genetic evolution of lung cancers and spatial heterogeneity: analysis of treatment naÌøve lesions.,/pubmed/29933065,"INTRODUCTION: Data regarding the pre-treatment inter-tumor heterogeneity ofpotential biomarkers in advanced-stage lung cancers is limited. A finding of suchheterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions would prove valuable todetermine if a metastatic lesion can be a surrogate for the primary tumor, asmore biomarkers will likely be used in the future to inform treatment decisions.METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing to analyze inter-tumor heterogeneity inthirty specimens (primary tumors, intra-thoracic, and extra-thoracic metastaticlesions) obtained from five treatment-nave lung cancer patients.RESULTS: The global unsupervised clustering analysis showed that the lesionsclustered at the individual patient level, rather than on the metastatic sites,suggesting that the characteristics of specific tumor cells have a greater impacton the gene expression signature than the microenvironment in which themetastasis develops. While, the mutational and transcriptional data highlight thepresence of inter-tumor heterogeneity, showing that the primary tumors areusually distinct from metastatic lesions. Through a comparison between metastaticlesions and the primary tumors, we observed that pathways related to cellproliferation were upregulated, while immune-related pathways were downregulated in metastatic lesions.CONCLUSION: These data not only provide insight into the evolution of lungcancers, but also imply possibilities and limitations of biomarker-basedtreatment in lung cancers.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Immunomodulatory and enhanced antitumor activity of a modified thymosin ë±1 in melanoma and lung cancer.,/pubmed/29933059,"Tumor-targeted therapy is an attractive strategy for cancer treatment. Peptidehormone thymosin _1 (T_1) has been used against several diseases, includingcancer, but its activity is pleiotropic. Herein, we designed a fusion proteinT_1-iRGD by introducing the tumor homing peptide iRGD to T_1. Results show thatT_1-iRGD can promote T-cell activation and CD86 expression, thereby exertingbetter effect and stronger inhibitory against melanoma and lung cancer,respectively, than T_1 in vivo. These effects are indicated by the reduceddensities of tumor vessels and T_1-iRGD accumulation in tumors. Moreover,compared with T_1, T_1-iRGD can attach more B16F10 and H460 cells and exhibitssignificantly better immunomodulatory activity in immunosuppression modelsinduced by hydrocortisone. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and structuralanalysis results revealed that T_1 and T_1-iRGD both adopted a helicalconfirmation in the presence of trifluoroethanol, indicating the structural basisof their functions. These findings highlight the vital function of T_1-iRGD intumor-targeted therapy and suggest that T_1-iRGD is a better antitumor drug than T_1.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Biological mechanisms of non-linear dose-response for respirable mineral fibers.,/pubmed/29932955,"Sufficiently high and prolonged inhalation exposures to some respirable elongatedmineral particles (REMPs), notably including amphibole asbestos fibers, canincrease risk of inflammation-mediated diseases including malignant mesothelioma,pleural diseases, fibrosis, and lung cancer. Chronic inflammation involvesongoing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which enables immune cells toproduce potent proinflammatory cytokines IL-1_ and IL-18. Reactive oxygen species(ROS) (in particular, mitochondrial ROS) contribute to NRLP3 activation via awell-elucidated mechanism involving oxidation of reduced thioredoxin andassociation of thioredoxin-interacting protein with NLRP3. Lysosomaldestabilization, efflux of cytosolic potassium ions and influx of calcium ions,signals from damaged mitochondria, both translational and post-translationalcontrols, and prion-like polymerization have increasingly clear roles inregulating NLRP3 activation. As the molecular biology of inflammation-mediatedresponses to REMP exposure becomes clearer, a practical question looms: What dothese mechanisms imply for the shape of the dose-response function relatingexposure concentrations and durations for EMPs to risk of pathological responses?Dose-response thresholds or threshold-like nonlinearities can arise from (a)Cooperativity in assembly of supramolecular signaling complexes; (b) Positivefeedback loops and bistability in regulatory networks; (c) Overwhelming ofdefensive barriers maintaining homeostasis; and (d) Damage thresholds, as inlysosome destabilization-induced activation of NLRP3. Each of these mechanismsholds for NLRP3 activation in response to stimuli such as REMP exposures. It istherefore timely to consider the implications of these advances in biologicalunderstanding for human health risk assessment with dose-response thresholds.",N,,,,,,,,,,
UBE2M Is a Stress-Inducible Dual E2 for Neddylation and Ubiquitylation that Promotes Targeted Degradation of UBE2F.,/pubmed/29932898,"UBE2M and UBE2F are two family members of neddylation E2 conjugating enzyme that,together with E3s, activate CRLs (Cullin-RING Ligases) by catalyzing cullinneddylation. However, whether and how two E2s cross-talk with each other arelargely unknown. Here, we report that UBE2M is a stress-inducible gene subjected to cis-transactivation by HIF-1 and AP1, and MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of E1 NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), upregulates UBE2M via blocking degradationof HIF-1_ and c-JUN. UBE2M is a dual E2 for targeted ubiquitylation anddegradation of UBE2F, acting as a neddylation E2 to activate CUL3-Keap1 E3 under physiological conditions but as a ubiquitylation E2 for Parkin-DJ-1 E3 understressed conditions. UBE2M-induced UBE2F degradation leads to CRL5 inactivationand subsequent NOXA accumulation to suppress the growth of lung cancer cells.Collectively, our study establishes a negative regulatory axis between twoneddylation E2s with UBE2M ubiquitylating UBE2F, and two CRLs with CRL3inactivating CRL5.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Impact of Acute Exposure to Cigarette Smoke on Airway Gene Expression.,/pubmed/29932825,"BACKGROUND: Understanding effects of Acute Smoke Exposure (ASE) on airwayepithelial gene expression and their relationship with the effects of ChronicSmoke Exposure (CSE) may provide biological insights into the development ofsmoking-related respiratory diseases.METHODS: Bronchial airway epithelial cell brushings were collected from 63individuals without recent cigarette smoke exposure, before and 24-hours aftersmoking three cigarettes. RNA from these samples was profiled on Affymetrix HumanGene 1.0 ST microarrays.RESULTS: We identified 91 genes differentially expressed 24-hours after ASE (FDR &lt; 0.25). ASE induced genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, oxidativestress, and inflammation and repressed genes related to cilium morphogenesis and cell cycle. While many genes altered by ASE are altered similarly in chronicsmokers, metallothionein genes are induced by ASE and suppressed in chronicsmokers. Metallothioneins are also suppressed in current and former smokers with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to as little as three cigarettes and chronic smoking induce largely concordant changes in airway epithelial gene expression.Differences in short-term and long-term effects of smoking on metallothioneinexpression and their relationship to lung cancer requires further study giventhese enzymes' role in the oxidative stress response.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"hsa_circ_0000729, a potential prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.",/pubmed/29932500,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs)may play an important role in oncogenesis and tumor development; however, theirrole in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. We identified thedifferentially expressed circRNAs in LUAD and investigated the potentialmechanisms for cancer progression.METHODS: We examined differentially expressed circRNAs in LUAD and paired normal tissues using downloaded circRNA microarrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Weconstructed gene co-expression networks based on the degree of Pearsoncorrelation to predict the critical circRNA in LUAD. Gene Ontology analysis wasperformed on the genes in the network. We observed one novel circRNA upregulated in LUAD, hsa_circ_0000792, as well as its potential sponged microRNA, miR-375.Subsequent real-time quantitative PCR was used to verify the bioinformaticsanalysis.RESULTS: Several circRNAs showed significantly different expression levels inLUAD tissues. Real-time quantitative PCR and further co-expression networkanalysis of 42 matched tissue samples showed a significant difference inexpression between LUAD and normal tissues in hsa_circ_0000792 (P_<_0.001). Webuilt a network of hsa_circ_0000792-targeted miRNA gene interactions, includingmiR-375 and the corresponding messenger RNAs. Gene Ontology analysis revealedthat hsa_circ_0000792 could participate in signal transduction and cellcommunication during LUAD development. Larger area under the curve by receiveroperating characteristic curve analysis of hsa_circ_0000792 and miR-375 (0.815and 0.772, respectively) in LUAD indicated greater potential as biomarkers.CONCLUSIONS: We identified hsa_circ_0000792 as a potential LUAD biomarker;however, further studies are required to determine the mechanism of this circRNA in LUAD development.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Fibrin patch influences the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1ë± and nuclear factor-ë¼Bp65 factors on ischemic intestinal anastomosis.,/pubmed/29932372,"The intestinal anastomotic failure is one of the most severe complications ingastrointestinal surgery. Despite the great surgical improvements during the lastdecade, anastomotic leak rates remain practically the same, with a dramaticallyhigh grade of morbidity for patients. Leakages are usually the final consequence of ischemia in the anastomosis, leading to tissue hypoxia. In response tohypoxia, the cell orchestrates a variety of coordinated responses in order torestore oxygen homeostasis. The molecular mechanism of hypoxia sensitivityinvolves oxygen sensing hydroxylases, prolyl-hydroxylases, orchestrating two maintranscription factors related to induction of inßammation and angiogenesis,namely nuclear factor-_B and hypoxia-inducible factors. The immunohistochemicalexpression of two transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factors-1_ and nuclear factor-_B p65 has already been described in several disorders, including woundhealing, asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis,cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute colitis. In the surgical field,fibrin sealants have been widely used to prevent leaks in lung surgery and theymight also be useful as a reinforcement of sutures in intestinal anastomosis. Thecommercial fibrin sealant patches are hemostatic and adhesive surgical agentsmainly derived from human plasma. We herein report the results of a prospectiverandomized experimental study on pigs. We performed a high-risk leakage model of bowel anastomosis, causing a significant devascularization of 10-15 cm of thebowel wall before performing a conventional colo-ileal anastomosis. We randomizedthe animals to receive a covering of the anastomosis with a fibrin patch (casegroup) or not (control group). We report the changes in the immunohistochemicalexpression of the proteins involved in tissue response to hypoxia in theexperimental model. Our results indicate that the fibrin patch delays the healingresponse, promoting a longer lasting inflammation in the surgical bed.Nevertheless, the fibrin patches effectiveness to reduce dehiscence shown inclinical practice suggests that this delay does not negatively affect patients'outcome. Impact statement The consequences of the anastomotic failure aredramatic for patients. Understanding how the ever-increasing use of fibrinsealant, that seems to have a beneficial effect on the anastomoses, interactswith the tissue and the healing process can help to justify its use and encourageresearch on how to improve this effect even more. We feel that the present workshows that the patch can improve healing by complex mechanisms other than themere contention and physical support of the intestine. Furthermore, research isneeded to confirm our preliminary findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Long noncoding RNA lung cancer associated transcript 1 promotes proliferation and invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells by negatively regulating miR-495-3p.,/pubmed/29932248,"Recently, long noncoding RNAs have emerged as new gene regulators and prognostic markers in several cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, wefocused on the long noncoding RNA lung cancer associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1)based on clear cell RCC (ccRCC) the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data. However,whether aberrant expression of LUCAT1 in ccRCC is correlated with malignancy,metastasis or prognosis has not been elucidated. In the current study, we foundthat the expression of LUCAT1 was upregulated in ccRCC tissues and cancer celllines. Upregulated LUCAT1 was positively correlated with larger tumor size,advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, higher smoking frequency, nodalmetastasis and shorter overall survival in patients with ccRCC. Inhibition ofLUCAT1 by small interfering RNA reduced cell proliferation and invasion of ccRCC cells in vitro. In vivo assay showed that the tumor volume and weight were lower in the group of LUCAT1 inhibition than that in the control group. We then foundthat LUCAT1 directly bound and inhibited the expression of micoRNA-495-3p(miR-495-3p), which subsequently regulated the expression of specialadenine-thymine (AT)-rich DNA-binding protein 1 (SATB1).

Understanding Intratumor Heterogeneity and Evolution in NSCLC and Potential New Therapeutic Approach.,/pubmed/29932159,"Advances in innovative technology, including next-generation sequencing, haveallowed comprehensive genomic analysis and the elucidation of the genomic aspect of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). Moreover, models of the evolution of thecancer genome have been proposed by integrating these analyses. Cancer has beenconsidered to accumulate genetic abnormalities for clonal evolution in time andspace, and these evolutionary patterns vary depending on the organs of primarysites. Selection pressure is an important determinant of such evolutionarypatterns. With weak selection pressure, more diverse clones coexist, andheterogeneity increases. Heterogeneity is maximized when there is no selectionpressure; in other words, neutral evolution occurs. Some types of cancer such as lung cancer evolve in conditions that have maintained close to neutral evolution and produce diverse variants. This ITH is a key factor contributing to the lethaloutcome of cancer, therapeutic failure, and drug resistance. This factorreaffirms the complexity and subtle adaptability of cancer.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in that they can reprogram theirmetabolism to support a rapid proliferation rate and alter oxidativephosphorylation processes toward lactic acid fermentation, even under aerobicconditions. Therefore we aimed to identify new compounds that might act asPyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) activators and to investigate their anti-cancerefficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.METHODS: The molecular docking method was applied to screen PKM2 activators from our virtual natural products library. Then, compounds with promising dockingscores were examined for cytotoxic effects in a panel of NSCLC cells using theMTT assay. Functional effects and therapeutic mechanisms were investigated by in vitro enzyme assays, western blotting (WB) and flow cytometry.RESULTS: Molecular docking showed that 0089-0022 acts as a potential PKM2activator by binding to the kinase pocket. An in vitro enzyme activity assayshowed that 0089-0022 is a direct PKM2 activator and that it effectively induces apoptosis in A549 and H1975 cells through inhibition of AKT phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 0089-0022 activates PKM2 and thus is apromising anti-cancer therapeutic candidate in NSCLC.

Fe-Au Nanoparticle-Coupling for Ultrasensitive Detections of Circulating Tumor DNA.,/pubmed/29931715,"Effectiveness of cancer therapy relies heavily on the efficient early diagnosis. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection is one of the most clinically meaningful liquid biopsy approaches for the noninvasive cancer early diagnosis, which,unfortunately, cannot be applied as a routine diagnostic tool till a number ofobstacles, for example, unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity, and extremelyhigh costs, are overcome. Here, the first paradigm of nanomaterial's application in the extremely specific, ultrasensitive, and yet economical ctDNA detections isreported based on a facile nanoparticle-coupling strategy without amplification, with which polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-introduced bias and other shortcomingsare successfully circumvented. Aiming at seven Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus (KRAS)point mutations, the present strategy exhibits high specificity and an ultrahigh sensitivity of detecting as low as 0.1 pg mL-1 of KRAS point mutation withoutprior PCR amplification. Discriminating KRAS gene mutations in lungadenocarcinoma patients at an extremely low detection limit equivalent to 0.12%mutation relative to wild-type gene is successful. It is envisioned that thisnanoparticle-coupling approach could be routinely applied clinically forultra-early diagnosis and monitoring of diverse malignant tumors, thusfacilitating the fight against cancer.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Extranodal Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Molecular Features, Prognosis, and Risk of Central Nervous System Recurrence.",/pubmed/29931605,"OPINION STATEMENT: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) arises from extranodalorgans in about 30% of cases. Its prognosis and risk of recurrence in the centralnervous system (CNS) vary according to the primary site of origin. Recent studiesbegin to clarify these differences using molecular classification. Testicular,breast, and uterine DLBCL (as well as possibly primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg-type)share a high prevalence of the non-germinal center B cell (non-GCB) phenotype andthe MYD88/CD79B-mutated (MCD) genotype. These biologic features, which resembleprimary CNS lymphoma, may underlie their stage-independent propensity for CNSinvolvement. Management of these lymphomas should involve CNS prophylaxis,preferably using systemic high-dose methotrexate to prevent intraparenchymalrecurrence. Involvement of the kidneys, adrenal glands, ovary, bone marrow, lung,or pleura usually indicates disseminated disease, conferring worse prognosis.Involvement of these sites is often associated with high CNS-InternationalPrognostic Index (IPI), concurrent MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements, orintravascular lymphoma-risk factors warranting CNS prophylaxis. In contrast,craniofacial, thyroid, localized bone, or gastric lymphomas have a variableprevalence of the non-GCB phenotype and lack MYD88 mutations. Their outcomes withstandard immunochemotherapy are excellent, and the risk of CNS recurrence is low.We recommend individualized consideration of CNS prophylaxis based on the CNS-IPIscore and anatomical proximity in cases of epidural, orbital, or skullinvolvement. Rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy is a standard approach forall extranodal DLBCLs. Surgery is no longer required for any primary site, butroutine consolidative radiation therapy is recommended for testicular lymphoma.Radiation therapy also appears to be associated with better progression-freesurvival in primary bone DLBCL. Future studies should better distinguish primary from secondary sites of extranodal involvement, and investigate the associationof newly identified genotypes with the risk of CNS or systemic recurrence.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Early-Stage and Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29931587,"OPINION STATEMENT: Surgical resection ± chemotherapy ± radiation or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are established treatment modalities for resectablestage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and concurrent chemotherapy withradiation is the therapy of choice for unresectable locally advanced disease.Despite treatment with curative intent, most patients subsequently relapse anddevelop distant disease. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors represents a major advancement in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Therapy against programed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) is associated with asignificant improvement in overall survival in stage IV disease, and theseresults have led to a great interest in evaluating these agents in earlier-stage NSCLC. The preliminary data from ongoing trials suggest that the integration ofcheckpoint blockage into the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC is safe, tolerable, and has the potential to improve outcomes without addingsubstantial toxicity. In the current review, we provide an overview of theemerging data on the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associatedprotein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors in the treatment of early-stage and locallyadvanced NSCLC, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials and combinationstrategies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prognostic value of distant metastasis sites and surgery in stage IV colorectal cancer: a population-based study.,/pubmed/29931408,"PURPOSE: We investigated the prognostic value of distant metastasis sites amongpatients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and the significance ofmetastasectomy and resection of the primary CRC.METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectaladenocarcinoma were selected using the surveillance, epidemiology, and endresults (SEER) database. The prognosis of these patients was compared accordingto the site of metastasis (liver, lung, bone, and brain). A total of 15,133patients suffered from isolated organ involvement, while 5135 patientsexperienced multiple organ metastases.RESULTS: In the isolated organ metastasis cohort, median overall survival (OS)for patients with liver, lung, bone, and brain metastases was 16, 20, 7, and5Êmonths, respectively. Patients with isolated lung metastases had bettercancer-specific survival (CSS) and OS as compared to patients with metastases at any other sites (p_<_0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Patients with isolated livermetastases had better prognosis as compared to patients with isolated bone orbrain metastases (p_<_0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Moreover, patients with asingle metastatic site had better prognosis than patients with multiple organsinvolved (p_<_0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Multivariate analysis in patients withisolated organ metastases demonstrated that age ²_60Êyears, rectal cancer, being married, non-black race, N0 stage, and surgery of the primary and distant lesionsshowed more favorable prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: The metastatic site was an independent prognostic factor in stage IVcolorectal cancer. Also, carefully chosen patients may benefit from surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
RADON AND THORON PROGENY IN DUTCH DWELLINGS.,/pubmed/29931357,"Radon and thoron progenies in Dutch dwellings cause ~400 cases of lung cancer peryear. Some 30% of the risk is due to thoron progeny, which demonstrates that the influence of thoron progeny is much larger than previously anticipated. This was concluded from a national survey in 2500 Dutch dwellings, built since 1930. Radonconcentrations (15.6 ± 0.3 Bq m-3 on average) are correlated to type of dwelling,year of construction, ventilation system, location (soil type) and smokingbehaviour of inhabitants. The survey data support the establishment of acomparatively low national reference level for radon in dwellings in theNetherlands of 100 Bq m-3, in line with recommendations by WHO and ICRP. Some 24 thousand of the 6.2 million dwellings in the Netherlands (built since 1930) areexpected to exceed this level. Around 80% of these are located in the relatively small group of naturally ventilated single-family houses in two designatedgeographical areas. Radon concentrations above 200 Bq m-3 are rare in theNetherlands and simple and inexpensive measures will be sufficient to reduceenhanced radon concentrations to values below the national reference level.Thoron progeny concentrations (0.64 Bq m-3, on average) show correlations withyear of construction and smoking behaviour. In 75 additional dwellings, a pilotstudy was conducted to determine the relationship between the exhalation ofthoron from walls and the concentration of thoron progeny in the room. Thoronexhalation values exceeding the median value of 2.2 _ 10-2 Bq m-2 s-1 by a factor10 or more were found frequently, but enhanced concentrations of thoron progenywere measured only occasionally. Under very unfavourable conditions, however, forinstance if phosphogypsum is applied as finishing material on all walls andceilings in the house, strongly elevated thoron progeny concentrations may occur.This survey yielded a maximum recording of 13.3 Bq m-3. There is no reason toexpect that such levels are specific to the Netherlands, indicating that in otherregions with low radon levels, thoron may be a more important contributor to the population dose as well.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High BMI has no impact on the survival of Chinese patients with lower thoracic esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with curative esophagectomy: a propensity score-matched study.,/pubmed/29931316,"Controversy still exists as to whether a high body mass index (BMI) has anyimpact on the long-term survival of esophageal cancer patients treated withcurative esophagectomy. Therefore, we conducted this propensity score-matched(PSM) study to explore the prognostic value of high BMI in Chinese patients with lower thoracic esophageal adenocarcinoma for the first time. We retrospectivelycollected data of patients with lower thoracic esophageal adenocarcinoma whounderwent curative esophagectomy in our department from January 2009 to December 2016. Patients were grouped into high BMI group (³23 kg/m2) and normal BMI group (18.5-22.9 kg/m2) according to the Asian specific BMI cutoff value. Both Coxregression survival analysis and PSM analysis were applied. Finally, a total of132 patients were included for analysis. Fifty-three patients were in the highBMI group while 79 patients were in the normal BMI group. There was nosignificant difference regarding age, gender, comorbidity, tumor differentiation,tumor site, lymphovascular invasion, or surgical approaches between the twogroups. However, patients with a high BMI tended to have more stage III diseases but a lower rate of adjuvant therapy application than those with a normal BMI.For survival, there was no significant survival difference between patients with a high BMI and those with a normal BMI (5-year overall survival (OS): 40.8% vs.48.1%; PÊ=Ê0.398). In the multivariate analysis, high BMI was not found to be an independent prognostic factor (HRÊ=Ê1.028, 95%CI: 0.621-1.667, PÊ=Ê0.945). Atotal of 92 well-matched patients were included after PSM analysis. However,there was still no significant difference of survival between the two groups(5-year OS: 41.4% vs. 43.3%; PÊ=Ê0.760). Therefore, high BMI has no impact onsurvival of Chinese patients with lower thoracic esophageal adenocarcinomatreated with curative esophagectomy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Overcoming drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations showing AXL activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition is critical in conquering ALK-positive lung cancer.,/pubmed/29930762,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) induce adramatic response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the ALKfusion gene. However, acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs remains an inevitableproblem. In this study, we aimed to discover novel therapeutic targets to conquerALK-positive lung cancer. We established three types of ALK-TKI (crizotinib,alectinib and ceritinib)-resistant H2228 NSCLC cell lines by high exposure andstepwise methods. We found these cells showed a loss of ALK signaling,overexpressed AXL with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and had cancerstem cell-like (CSC) properties, suggesting drug-tolerant cancer cellsubpopulations. Similarly, we demonstrated that TGF-_1 treated H2228 cells alsoshowed AXL overexpression with EMT features and ALK-TKI resistance. The AXLinhibitor, R428, or HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, were effective in reversingALK-TKI resistance and EMT changes in both ALK-TKI-resistant and TGF-_1-exposedH2228 cells. Tumor volumes of xenograft mice implanted with establishedH2228-ceritinib-resistant (H2228-CER) cells were significantly reduced aftertreatment with ganetespib, or ganetespib in combination with ceritinib. SomeALK-positive NSCLC patients with AXL overexpression showed a poorer response tocrizotinib therapy than patients with a low expression of AXL. ALKsignaling-independent AXL overexpressed in drug-tolerant cancer cellsubpopulations with EMT and CSC features may be commonly involved commonlyinvolved in intrinsic and acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. This suggests AXL and HSP90 inhibitors may be promising therapeutic drugs to overcome drug-tolerantcancer cell subpopulations in ALK-positive NSCLC patients for the reason thatALK-positive NSCLC cells do not live through ALK-TKI therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring EGFR-T790M mutation in serum/plasma for prediction of response to third-generation EGFR inhibitors in patients with lung cancer.,/pubmed/29930751,"Background: Osimertinib is efficacious in lung cancer patients with epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and acquired resistance (AR) to EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitors due to EGFR-T790M mutation (T790M). We sought todescribe T790M changes in serum/plasma during osimertinib therapy and correlatethese changes with treatment outcomes.Material and methods: Serum/plasma from EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients withT790M-AR was collected before and during osimertinib treatment. Changes in T790M were evaluated using a peptide-nucleic acid-PCR assay, and correlated withclinical and radiographic response.Results: Thirteen patients were included. Median time on osimertinib treatmentwas 10.6 months with a median progression-free survival of 13.6 months. Bestresponse to osimertinib was partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) orprogression (PD) in 46.1%, 30.8% and 23.1% of patients, respectively.Most of the patients were paucisymptomatic at baseline. Symptom improvement was reported in66.6% of responder patients; while symptoms remained stable in 75% of patientswith SD, and 66% of patients with PD had clinical deterioration.Three patterns ofT790M changes during osimertinib treatment were identified. T790 remaineddetectable with PD or a short-lasting SD in 15.4% of the patients. T790Mdisappeared in 69.2% of patients with PR or SD. T790M disappeared, despiteclinical and/or radiographic progression in 15.4% of the patients.Conclusion: Changes of T790M in serum/plasma in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients with T790M-AR might be a useful marker of symptomatic and radiographic outcome toosimertinib. Longer follow-up is needed to establish if subsequent emergence ofT790M could be a marker of resistance.",Single arm,Y,,,,,,,,,
Role of Tumor-Derived Chemokines in Osteolytic Bone Metastasis.,/pubmed/29930538,"Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients.The bone marrow is a common destination for many malignant cancers, includingbreast carcinoma (BC), prostate carcinoma, multiple myeloma, lung carcinoma,uterine cancer, thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. The molecular mechanism by which metastatic cancer are able to recognize, infiltrate, andcolonize bone are still unclear. Chemokines are small soluble proteins whichunder normal physiological conditions mediate chemotactic trafficking ofleukocytes to specific tissues in the body. In the context of metastasis, thebest characterized role for the chemokine system is in the regulation of primary tumor growth, survival, invasion, and homing to specific secondary sites.However, there is ample evidence that metastatic tumors exploit chemokines tomodulate the metastatic niche within bone which ultimately results in osteolytic bone disease. In this review, we examine the role of chemokines in metastatictumor growth within bone. In particular, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, IL-8/CXCL8,and CXCL12 are consistently involved in promoting osteoclastogenesis and tumorgrowth. We will also evaluate the suitability of chemokines as targets forchemotherapy with the use of neutralizing antibodies and chemokinereceptor-specific antagonists.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Plasma CRABP2 as a Novel Biomarker in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,/pubmed/29930489,"Background: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortalityworldwide. We previously reported the identification of a new genetic marker,cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2), in lung cancer tissues. Theaim of this study was to assess plasma levels of CRABP2 from patients withnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: Blood samples that were collected from 122 patients with NSCLC betweenSeptember 2009 and September 2013 were selected for the analysis, along withsamples from age- (± 5 years), sex-, and cigarette smoking history (± 10pack-years [PY])-matched controls from the Korea Biobank Network. The controlspecimens were from patients who were without malignancies or pulmonary diseases.We measured plasma levels of CRABP2 using commercially available enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay kits.Results: The mean age of the NSCLC patients was 71.8 ± 8.9 years, and the median cigarette smoking history was 32 PY (range, 0-150 PY). Plasma CRABP2 levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLC than in the matched controls (37.63 ±28.71 ng/mL vs. 24.09 ± 21.09 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Higher plasma CRABP2 levels werealso correlated with lower survival rates in NSCLC patients (P = 0.014).Conclusion: Plasma CRABP2 levels might be a novel diagnostic and prognosticmarker in NSCLC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
PHLPP2 stabilization by p27 mediates its inhibition of bladder cancer invasion by promoting autophagic degradation of MMP2 protein.,/pubmed/29930380,"Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) is a tumor suppressor that catalyzes the de-phosphorylation of the AGC kinases,while p27 acts as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell cycle, apoptosis, andcell motility. Our previous studies have identified that PHLPP2 participates ininhibition of transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells following lungcarcinogen B[a]P/B[a]PDE exposure. However, nothing was known about theassociation of p27 with regulation of PHLPP2 expression and the role of PHLPP2 inbladder cancer (BC) invasion. In our current studies, we demonstrated that PHLPP2inhibited BC invasion through promoting MMP2 degradation via p62-mediatedautophagy; and p27 expression was able to stabilize PHLPP2 protein by inhibiting protein degradation of Hsp90, which could directly bind to PHLPP2 and protect it from degradation. More in-depth studies discovered that stabilization of Hsp90 byp27 was mediated by calpain1 proteolysis system, whereas p27 inhibited calpain1gene transcription by attenuating Jak1/Stat1 cascade in human invasive BC cells. Collectively, we for the first time revealed PHLPP2 downregulation in BCs and itsparticipating in promotion of BC invasion, as well as novel role of p27 andmechanisms underlying its regulation of PHLPP2 protein degradation throughHsp90-dependent manner. Our findings improve our understanding of p27 and PHLPP2 roles and their crosstalk in regulation of BC invasion, which further contributesto improve the current strategy for invasive bladder cancer therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mitotic polarization of transcription factors during asymmetric division establishes fate of forming cancer cells.,/pubmed/29930325,"A model of K-Ras-initiated lung cancer was used to follow the transition ofprecancerous adenoma to adenocarcinoma. In hypoxic, Tgf-_1-rich interiors ofadenomas, we show that adenoma cells divide asymmetrically to producecancer-generating cells highlighted by epithelial mesenchymal transition and aCD44/Zeb1 loop. In these cells, Zeb1 represses the Smad inhibitor Zeb2/Sip1,causing Pten loss and launching Tgf-_1 signaling that drives nucleartranslocation of Yap1. Surprisingly, the nuclear polarization of transcriptionfactors during mitosis establishes parent and daughter fates prior to cytokinesisin sequential asymmetric divisions that generate cancer cells from precancerouslesions. Mutation or knockdown of Zeb1 in the lung blocked the production ofCD44hi, Zeb1hi cancer-generating cells from adenoma cells. A CD44/Zeb1 loop then initiates two-step transition of precancerous cells to cancer cells via a stable intermediate population of cancer-generating cells. We show these initialcancer-generating cells are independent of cancer stem cells generated in tumors by p53-regulated reprogramming of existing cancer cells.",N,,,,,,,,,,

MRI head indicated that this SOL had spilt its contents into thesubarachnoid and intraventricular spaces. Due to a fluctuating Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS), the patient underwent emergency debulking. Macroscopically, a frail-walledcystic tumour filled with straw-coloured fluid was noted; histology confirmedmetastasis from a primary lung adenocarcinoma.

A HIF-LIMD1 negative feedback mechanism mitigates the pro-tumorigenic effects of hypoxia.,/pubmed/29930174,"The adaptive cellular response to low oxygen tensions is mediated by thehypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a family of heterodimeric transcription factorscomposed of HIF-_ and HIF-_ subunits. Prolonged HIF expression is a keycontributor to cellular transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. As such,HIF degradation under hypoxic conditions is an essential homeostatic andtumour-suppressive mechanism. LIMD1 complexes with PHD2 and VHL in physiological oxygen levels (normoxia) to facilitate proteasomal degradation of the HIF-_subunit. Here, we identify LIMD1 as a HIF-1 target gene, which mediates apreviously uncharacterised, negative regulatory feedback mechanism for hypoxicHIF-_ degradation by modulating PHD2-LIMD1-VHL complex formation. Hypoxicinduction of LIMD1 expression results in increased HIF-_ protein degradation,inhibiting HIF-1 target gene expression, tumour growth and vascularisation.Furthermore, we report that copy number variation at the LIMD1 locus occurs in47.1% of lung adenocarcinoma patients, correlates with enhanced expression of aHIF target gene signature and is a negative prognostic indicator. Taken together,our data open a new field of research into the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosisof LIMD1-negative lung cancers.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Liver resection and transplantation in Caroli disease and syndrome.,/pubmed/29929811,"INTRODUCTION: Caroli disease (CD) is a congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. In combination with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, it is called Caroli syndrome (CS). Infectious complications and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma aresecondary problems. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical pattern andoutcome in patients with CD/CS who underwent liver surgery.METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2016, 21 patients with CD/CS weretreated with liver resection or transplantation (LTX) and post-operative data of patients with CD/CS were retrospectively analysed in a database.RESULTS: Two patients underwent LTX, and 19 patients underwent liver resectiondue to CD/CS. During follow-up, one patient developed lung cancer nine yearsafter LTX. Patients resected due to CD/CS were predominantly females (74%) withan overall low incidence of co-morbidities. The median post-operativeClavien-Dindo score was 1 (range: 0-3). There was no death during a medianfollow-up period of over five years. In four patients, cholangiocarcinoma wasconfirmed. Tumor recurrence was seen in three patients, and was treated withchemotherapy or repeated liver resection.CONCLUSIONS: LTX and liver resections due to CD/CS are rare and associated withan acceptable post-operative morbidity and low mortality.

Therapeutic Silencing of miR-214 Inhibits Tumor Progression in Multiple Mouse Models.,/pubmed/29929788,"We previously demonstrated that miR-214 is upregulated in malignant melanomas andtriple-negative breast tumors and promotes metastatic dissemination by affecting a complex pathway including the anti-metastatic miR-148b. Importantly, tumordissemination could be reduced by blocking miR-214 function or increasingmiR-148b expression or by simultaneous interventions. Based on this evidence,with the intent to explore the role of miR-214 as a target for therapy, weevaluated the capability of new chemically modified anti-miR-214, R97/R98, toinhibit miR-214 coordinated metastatic traits. Relevantly, when melanoma orbreast cancer cells were transfected with R97/R98, anti-miR-214 reduced miR-214expression and impaired transendothelial migration were observed. Noteworthy,when the same cells were injected in the tail vein of mice, cell extravasationand metastatic nodule formation in lungs were strongly reduced. Thus, suggesting that R97/R98 anti-miR-214 oligonucleotides were able to inhibit tumor cellescaping through the endothelium. More importantly, when R97/R98 anti-miR-214compounds were systemically delivered to mice carrying melanomas orÊbreast orneuroendocrine pancreatic cancers, a reduced number of circulating tumor cellsand lung or lymph node metastasis formation were detected. Similar results werealso obtained when AAV8-miR-214 sponges were used in neuroendocrine pancreatictumors. Based on this evidence, we propose miR-214 as a promising target foranti-metastatic therapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Knockdown of TRIM66 inhibits malignant behavior and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer.,/pubmed/29929749,"OBJECTIVE: The tripartite motif 66(TRIM66) is an important member of the TRIMprotein superfamily, which can participate in the expression of multipleproteins, and is closely associated with the behaviors of non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC). In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of TRIM66 in thisprocess in vitro using NSCLC cell lines, and the role of TRIM66 in regulatingepithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT) in NSCLC.METHODS: Western blotting was used to detect the TRIM66 protein expression levelsin NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B. We silenced itsexpression in A549 cells by transient siRNA transfection to ascertain thefunction of TRIM66 in NSCLC cells. Western blotting was used to detect theexpression of EMT-related proteins.RESULTS: TRIM66 protein content was highest in NSCLC cell line A549, comparedwith BEAS-2B, it showed that the TRIM66-siRNA group lung cancer cellproliferation was significantly reduced after knockdown of TRIM66, and knockdown of TRIM66 also suppressed invasion, migration and clonogenic ability of A549cells. Finally, we found that siRNA-mediated TRIM66 silencing suppressed EMT bydownregulating expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and upregulating that ofE-cadherin in NSCLC cells, which could effectively reduce the invasive,migratory, and proliferative capacities of lung cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Silence TRIM66 expression suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation,invasion, and migration. The siRNA-mediated TRIM66 silencing could block theoccurrence of EMT. TRIM66 could be a promising novel target for future NSCLCtreatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Doses to the heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA), and ipsilateral lung were evaluated andcompared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.RESULTS: The mean doses to the heart, LADCA and ipsilateral lung in 3D-CRT plans generated from 3D-CRT with FB, T-DIBH and A-DIBH were (2.89_±_1.30),(1.67_±_0.90) and (1.34_±_0.43) Gy (all P_<_0.05), respectively, with FB;(29.08_±_16.72), (13.94_±_14.74) and (10.22_±_10.30) Gy (all P_<_0.05),respectively, with T-DIBH; and (7.77_±_2.71), (7.32_±_1.42) and (6.90_±_1.60) Gy (all P_<_0.05), respectively, with A-DIBH. The mean doses to the heart, LADCA andipsilateral lung in IMRT plans were generated from IMRT with FB, T-DIBH andA-DIBH were (1.96_±_2.25), (1.37_±_0.44) and (1.18_±_0.26) Gy (all P_<_0.05),respectively, with FB; (16.10_±_7.45), (8.6_±_6.60) and (7.35_±_5.42) Gy (allP_<_0.05), respectively, with T-DIBH; and (5.90_±_2.24), (5.65_±_1.58) and(5.62_±_1.05) Gy (all P_>_0.05), respectively, with A-DIBH.CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that both 3D-CRT and IMRT plans with A-DIBHachieved lower cardiac and LADCA doses than plans with FB and T-DIBH; 3D-CRTplans with A-DIBH achieved lower ipsilateral lung doses than plans with FB andT-DIBH; and IMRT plans with A-DIBH had better outcomes than 3D-CRT plans withA-DIBH with respect to the mean dose to the heart, LADCA and ipsilateral lung.IMRT plans with A-DIBH should be incorporated into the daily routine forleft-sided breast RT.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Immune characterization of breast cancer metastases: prognostic implications.,/pubmed/29929548,"BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) evaluated in primary breastcancer (BC) convey prognostic information. Limited data in the metastatic settingare available.METHODS: Secondary lesions from 94ÊBC patients, 43 triple-negative (TN) and 51HER2-positive, were evaluated for TILs and expression of CD8, FOXP3, and PD-L1 byimmunohistochemistry.RESULTS: TILs levels on metastasis were generally low (median 5%) and did notdiffer between TN and HER2+ tumors. Younger patients showed significantly lowerTILs (p_=_0.002). In HER2+ patients, TILs were higher in lung metastases ascompared to other sites (p_=_0.038). TILs composition was different acrossmetastatic sites: skin metastases presented higher FOXP3 (pÊ=_0.002) and lowerCD8/FOXP3 ratio (p_=_0.032). Patients treated for metastatic BC prior to biopsyhad lower CD8 (overall: p_=_0.005, HER2+: p_=_0.011, TN: p_=_0.075). In TNpatients, median overall survival (OS) was 11.8 and 62.9Êmonths for patients withlow and high TILs, respectively (HR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11-0.76, log-rank p_=_0.008).CD8/FOXP3 ratio was also prognostic in TN patients (median OS 8.0, 13.2, and54.0Êmonths in 1st, 2nd and 3th tertile, log-rank p_=_0.019). Both TILs andCD8/FOXP3 ratio were independent factors at multivariate analysis.Counterintuitively, in HER2+ BC, low TILs tumors showed better prognosis (median OS 53.7 vs 39.9Êmonths in TILs low and TILs high, not statistically significant).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the relevance of TILs as prognostic biomarker for TNBC even in the advanced setting and provide novel hypothesis-generatingdata on potential sources of immune heterogeneity of metastatic BC.",N,,,,,,,,,,

PRUNE1 Deficiency: Expanding the Clinical and Genetic Spectrum.,/pubmed/29940663,"BACKGROUND: _Primary microcephaly and profound global developmental delay havebeen considered the core clinical phenotype in patients with bi-allelic PRUNE1mutations.METHODS: _Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a multiplex familyand extraction of further cases from a WES repository containing 571 childrenwith severe developmental disabilities and neurologic symptoms.RESULTS: _We identified bi-allelic PRUNE1 mutations in twelve children from sixunrelated families. All patients who survived beyond the first 6 months of lifehad early-onset global developmental delay, bilateral spastic paresis, dysphagia and difficult-to-treat seizures, while congenital or later-evolving microcephaly was not a consistent finding. Brain MRI showed variable anomalies withprogressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophies and T2-hyperintense brain stemlesions. Peripheral neuropathy was documented in five cases. Disease course wasprogressive in all patients and eight children died in the first or early second decade of life. In addition to the previously reported missense mutationp.(Asp106Asn), we observed a novel homozygous missense variant p.(Leu172Pro) and a homozygous contiguous gene deletion encompassing most of the PRUNE1 gene andpart of the neighboring BNIPL gene.CONCLUSIONS: _PRUNE1 deficiency causes severe early-onset disease affecting thecentral and peripheral nervous systems.

Combination of phenobarbital with phenytoin and pregabalin produces synergy in the mouse tonic-clonic seizure model: An isobolographic analysis.,/pubmed/29940514,"AIMS: Despite many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available to treat epilepsy,there is still about 30% of epilepsy patients inadequately treated with theseAEDs. For these patients, polytherapy with two or three AEDs to fully controltheir seizure attacks is recommended. Unfortunately, polytherapy is alwaysassociated with drug interactions, whose nature may be beneficial, neutral orunfavorable. To determine a type of interaction for the combination of three AEDs(i.e., phenobarbital [PB], phenytoin [PHT] and pregabalin [PGB]) at thefixed-ratio of 1:1:1, we used a model of tonic-clonic seizures in male albinoSwiss mice.MATERIALS AND METHOD: Tonic-clonic seizures in mice were evoked by a current(sine-wave, 25_mA, 500_V, 0.2_s stimulus duration) delivered via auricularelectrodes. The anticonvulsant effects of the three-drug combination (PB, PHT andPGB) in terms of suppression of tonic-clonic seizures in mice were assessed with type I isobolographic analysis. Potential acute side effects for the mixture ofPB, PHT and PGB along with total brain concentrations of the AEDs were determinedto confirm pharmacodynamic nature of observed interaction.RESULTS: The three-drug combination of PB, PHT and PGB (at the fixed-ratio of1:1:1) exerted synergistic interaction (at P_<_0.01) in the mouse model oftonic-clonic seizures. The combination of PB, PHT and PGB did not produce anyside effects in experimental animals, when measuring long-term memory, muscularstrength and motor coordination. The measurement of total brain concentrations ofPB, PHT and PGB was conducted to confirm that none of the three AEDssignificantly influenced total brain concentrations (pharmacokinetic profiles) ofthe other co-administered AEDs in mice.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction for the combination ofPB, PHT and PGB observed in this preclinical study can be translated intoclinical settings and this favorable AED combination is worthy of beingrecommended to some patients with refractory epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sexual dysfunction and associated factors in Chinese Han women with epilepsy.,/pubmed/29940378,"PURPOSE: Women with epilepsy (WWE) are believed to be at risk of sexualdysfunction (SD) and face many sexual challenges because of multiple factors.This study aimed to assess the factors associated with SD in Chinese Han WWE.METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 112 married WWE in the AffiliatedHospital of Yangzhou University with focal (FE) or generalized epilepsy (GE) onantiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and 120 healthy controls without epilepsy, all ofChinese Han nationality. Data collection tools included the Chinese version ofFemale Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Chinese version of Zung Self-RatingAnxiety Scale (SAS), the Chinese version of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale(SDS), the Chinese version of the revised Morisky Medication Adherence Scale(MMAS-8), and the Chinese version of the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale(NHS3). Chi-square test, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and binarylogistic regression were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: A high rate (70.5%) of SD was detected in WWE, with 24.2% in controls.Sexual dysfunction affected all dimensions: desire (85.7%), arousal (56.3%),lubrication (47.3%), orgasm (66.1%), satisfaction (58.9%), and pain (41.1%).Elevated rates of anxiety (40.2%) and depression (33%) and poor medicationadherence (31.3%) were also found in WWE.

"Wearable technology in epilepsy: The views of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.",/pubmed/29940377,"PURPOSE: In recent years, digital technology and wearable devices applied toseizure detection have progressively become available. In this study, weinvestigated the perspectives of people with epilepsy (PWE), caregivers (CG), andhealthcare professionals (HP). We were interested in their current use of digitaltechnology as well as their willingness to use wearables to monitor seizures. We also explored the role of factors influencing engagement with technology,including demographic and clinical characteristics, data confidentiality, needfor technical support, and concerns about strain or increased workload.METHODS: An online survey drawing on previous data collected via focus groups wasconstructed and distributed via a web link. Using logistic regression analyses,demographic, clinical, and other factors identified to influence engagement with technology were correlated with reported use and willingness to use digitaltechnology and wearables for seizure tracking.RESULTS: Eighty-seven surveys were completed, fifty-two (59.7%) by PWE, 13(14.4%) by CG, and 22 (25.3%) by HP. Responders were familiar with multipledigital technologies, including the Internet, smartphones, and personalcomputers, and the use of digital services was similar to the UK average.Moreover, age and disease-related factors did not influence access to digitaltechnology. The majority of PWE were willing to use a wearable device forlong-term seizure tracking. However, only a limited number of PWE reportedcurrent regular use of wearables, and nonusers attributed their choice touncertainty about the usefulness of this technology in epilepsy care. People withepilepsy envisaged the possibility of understanding their condition betterthrough wearables and considered, with caution, the option to send automaticemergency calls. Despite concerns around accuracy, data confidentiality, andtechnical support, these factors did not limit PWE's willingness to use digitaltechnology. Caregivers appeared willing to provide support to PWE using wearablesand perceived a reduction of their workload and anxiety. Healthcare professionalsidentified areas of application for digital technologies in their clinicalpractice, pending an appropriate reorganization of the clinical team to share theburden of data reviewing and handling.CONCLUSIONS: Unlike people who have other chronic health conditions, PWE appearednot to be at risk of digital exclusion. This study highlighted a great interestin the use of wearable technology across epilepsy service users, carers, andhealthcare professionals, which was independent of demographic and clinicalfactors and outpaced data security and technology usability concerns.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Intellectual outcome after a cortical lesion with versus without epilepsy: A life span neurodevelopmental view.,/pubmed/29940376,"In patients with cortical lesions, the structure of intelligence has never beenstudied as a function of age at lesion onset and presence vs absence of lesional epilepsy over the life span.METHOD: Two thousand one hundred eighty-six caseswere assembled bearing unilateral cortical lesions occurring at all ages (1301with seizures) with postlesion verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) (VIQ) andperformance IQ (PIQ).RESULTS: Global IQ significantly and constantly decreased as a function of age atlesion onset in the cases without epilepsy, and increased in the cases withepilepsy. Beyond the lesion onset age of 12_years, VIQ was significantly higherthan PIQ in the cases without epilepsy, and lower in the cases with epilepsy.

Effects of valproate on reproductive endocrine function in male patients with epilepsy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29940375,"BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) that is generally used as a first line agent for most idiopathic and symptomaticgeneralized epilepsies. Many studies have indicated that AEDs cause reproductive endocrine disorders in males, but the exact etiology underpinning thesedysfunctions is not clear. This meta-analysis and systematic review was intended to evaluate the effect of VPA on reproductive endocrine function in male patientswith epilepsy.METHODS: A literature search was performed using electronic databases up toDecember 2017 for eligible studies. The differences in the levels of thereproductive factors, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione (ADION) in the male patients with epilepsytreated with VPA (treatment group) were compared with the those of the healthycontrols (control group) by the use of the Standardized mean difference (SMD)with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS: Six publications with a total of 316 subjects were identified. Theresult revealed that the levels of FSH (SMD_=_-1.33, 95% CI: -2.60 to -0.07,P_=_0.039) and testosterone (SMD_=_-0.45, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.03, P_=_0.038) ofthe treatment group were decreased significantly compared with the healthycontrols. There was an increase in the levels of SHBG (SMD_=_0.41, 95% CI: -0.21 to 1.03, P_=_0.197), DHEAS (SMD_=_0.20, 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.45, P_=_0.126) andADION (SMD_=_0.73, 95% CI: -0.10 to 1.57, P_=_0.086), and a decrease in that ofLH(SMD_=_-0.71, 95% CI: -1.49 to 0.07, P_=_0.075) in the male patients withepilepsy treated with VPA, but the differences did not reach statisticalsignificance (P_>_0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that VPA may lead to a significantdecrease in the levels of FSH and testosterone and alter the concentrations ofLH, DHEAS, SHBG, and ADION to some extent, which might contribute to thereproductive endocrine dysfunction in male patients with epilepsy. It isimportant for clinical neurologists to be cautious when prescribing VPA toreproductive-aged male patients with epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Panic and epilepsy in adults: A systematic review.,/pubmed/29940374,"The purpose of the current paper was to review the empirical literature on thecooccurrence of panic and epilepsy, in order to determine whether there is anincreased risk of panic attacks and panic disorder among adults with epilepsy andan increased risk of epilepsy among adults with panic disorder. Given the overlapbetween panic and ictal fear, a preliminary aim of the current review was tocritically evaluate the methodology used to differentiate between diagnoses ofpanic disorder and epilepsy in existing research. A literature search wasconducted in relevant electronic databases, and articles that directly focused onpanic and epilepsy among adults were selected for the current review (n_=_17).Overall, results suggest that rates of epilepsy are elevated among individualswith panic disorder and that panic attacks are elevated among individuals withepilepsy, but rates of panic disorder among people with epilepsy areinconsistent. However, most studies did not use sufficiently rigorous methods to differentiate between panic disorder and epilepsy. Therefore, a critical nextstep in this area of research is to develop a standard procedure fordifferentiating ictal fear from panic attacks and panic disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The measurement of both carotid intima-media thickness and epicardial adipose tissue thickness in children with epilepsy receiving antiepileptic drug therapy.,/pubmed/29940373,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the carotid intima-mediathickness together with the thickness of the epicardial adipose tissue inpatients receiving antiepileptic drug therapy and to investigate the presence of increased cardiovascular risk in these patients.METHODS: The study included a total of 52 patients comprising 32 males and 20females who were diagnosed as having epilepsy and who were using one or moreantiepileptic drugs. The control group consisted of 34 healthy individualscomprising 16 males and 18 females. The individuals selected for the study group were requested to go to the hospital after overnight fasting. After bloodsampling for serum lipid value, the carotid intima-media thickness was measuredwith high resolution B-mode ultrasonography and epicardial adipose tissuethickness with echocardiography in the patients and the control group subjects.RESULTS: The carotid intima-media thickness was determined as 0.47_±_0.05_mm inthe patient group and 0.44_±_0.04_mm in the control group (p_=_0.028). Thecarotid intima-media thickness was measured as 0.45_±_0.05_mm in patients withepilepsy taking monotherapy and 0.49_±_0.04_mm in those taking polytherapy(p_=_0.003). The epicardial adipose tissue thickness was determined as3.42_±_0.09_mm in the patient group and 1.72_±_0.90_mm in the control group(p_=_0.000).

Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulatio (t-VNS): An adjunctive treatment option for refractory epilepsy.,/pubmed/29940349,"PURPOSE: The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety oftranscutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (t-VNS) in the palliative treatment ofdrug resistant epileptic patients ineligible for surgery.METHODS: Twenty adult patients received four hours of t-VNS per day for sixmonths (T1), followed by a two-month washout period (T2). The frequency and type of seizures recorded at T1 and T2 were compared with those occurring in the threemonths preceding study entry (T0). Responders (>30% reduction in the total numberof seizures) subsequently received two hours of t-VNS per day for further sixmonths (T3). All patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) and completedthe Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire at baseline and T1.RESULTS: At T1 six patients were considered responders. In these patients, at T3 the average reduction in seizure frequency was 60% compared to T0 (p_=_0.043),and 51% compared to T2 (p_=_0.043). Responders had more often seizures with falls(5 of 6; 83.3%) compared with non-responders (3 of 14; 21.4%) (p_=_0,010) andt-VNS reduced their frequency by a percentage ranging from 47.5 to 100%. Therewas no change in responders' EEG findings after stimulation. At the end of thetrial, three responders continued t-VNS, one implanted VNS.CONCLUSIONS: t-VNS had no or minimal side effects and significantly reducedseizures in about one third of the enrolled patients. Further studies should beplanned to assess whether t-VNS is a suitable tool to predict the efficacy ofimplanted VNS.",Single arm,Y,,,,,,,,,
Cost sharing for antiepileptic drugs: medication utilization and health plan costs.,/pubmed/29939508,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between health plan out-of-pocket (OOP)costs for antiepileptic drugs and healthcare utilization (HCU) and overall planspending among US-based commercial health plan beneficiaries with epilepsy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.METHODS: The Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims database for January 1, 2009, toJune 30, 2015, was used. Patients 65 years or younger with epilepsy and at least 12 months of continuous enrollment before index (date meeting first epilepsydiagnostic criteria) were included. Analyses were adjusted for age group, gender,beneficiary relationship, insurance plan type, and Charlson Comorbidity Indexscore. Primary outcomes included proportion of days covered (PDC), HCU, andhealthcare spending in 90-day postindex periods. Associations between OOP costsand mean PDC, HCU, and plan healthcare spending per 90-day period were estimated.RESULTS: Across 5159 plans, 187,241 beneficiaries met eligibility criteria; 54.3%were female, 41.7% were aged 45 to 65 years, and 62.4% were in preferred providerorganization plans. Across postindex 90-day periods, mean (SD) PDC,epilepsy-specific hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and emergency departmentvisits were 0.85 (0.26), 0.02 (0.13), 0.34 (0.47), and 0.05 (0.22), respectively.Median (interquartile range) spending per 90-day period was $1488 ($459-$4705);median epilepsy-specific spending was $139 ($18-$623). Multivariable linearregression without health plan fixed effects revealed that higher OOP spendingwas associated with a decrease in PDC (coefficient, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.009 to-0.006; P <.001) and an increase in overall spending (218.6; 95% CI, 47.9-389.2; P = .012). Health plan fixed effects model estimates were similar, except forepilepsy-specific spending, which was significant (120.6; 95% CI, 29.2-211.9; P =.010).CONCLUSIONS: Increases in beneficiaries' OOP costs led to higher overall spendingand lower PDC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Left temporal lobe language network connectivity in temporal lobe epilepsy.,/pubmed/29939211,"Impairment of naming function is a critical problem for temporal lobe epilepsypatients, yet the neural correlates of the disruption of temporal lobe languagenetworks are poorly understood. Using functional MRI, we investigated theactivation and task-related functional connectivity of left temporal lobelanguage networks and their relation to clinical naming performance and diseasecharacteristics. We studied 59 adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (35left temporal lobe epilepsy) and 32 healthy controls with auditory and visualnaming functional MRI tasks. Time series of activation maxima in the leftposterior inferior temporal lobe were extracted to create a psychophysiologicalinteraction regressor for subsequent seed-based whole-brain task-relatedfunctional connectivity analyses. Correlational analyses were performed to assessthe association of functional MRI activation and functional connectivity withclinical naming scores, age of onset of epilepsy, and duration of epilepsy.Auditory naming elicited activation in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrusand visual naming in the left fusiform gyrus across all groups. Activations inthe left inferior temporal gyrus, left thalamus and left supplementary motorregion during auditory naming as well as left fusiform activations during picturenaming correlated with better clinical naming performance. Functionalconnectivity analyses indicated coupling of left posterior inferior temporalregions to bilateral anterior and posterior temporal lobe regions and thebilateral inferior precentral gyrus as well as contralateral occipital cortex.Stronger functional connectivity was associated with better clinical namingperformance in all groups. In patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy only,functional connectivity increased with later age of onset of epilepsy and shorterdisease duration. This suggests that onset of seizures early in life andprolonged disease duration lead to disrupted recruitment of temporal lobenetworks ipsilateral to the seizure focus, which might account for namingdeficits in temporal lobe epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Intronic pentanucleotide TTTCA repeat insertion in the SAMD12 gene causes familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy type 1.,/pubmed/29939203,"Familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy is an autosomal dominantneurodegenerative disease, characterized by cortical tremor and epilepticseizures. Although four subtypes (types 1-4) mapped on different chromosomes(8q24, 2p11.1-q12.2, 5p15.31-p15.1 and 3q26.32-3q28) have been reported, thecausative gene has not yet been identified. Here, we report the genetic study in a cohort of 20 Chinese pedigrees with familial cortical myoclonic tremor withepilepsy. Linkage and haplotype analysis in 11 pedigrees revealed maximumtwo-point logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores from 1.64 to 3.77 (LOD scores infive pedigrees were >3.0) in chromosomal region 8q24 and narrowed the candidateregion to an interval of 4.9 Mb. Using whole-genome sequencing, long-rangepolymerase chain reaction and repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, weidentified an intronic pentanucleotide (TTTCA)n insertion in the SAMD12 gene asthe cause, which co-segregated with the disease among the 11 pedigrees mapped on 8q24 and additional seven unmapped pedigrees. Only two pedigrees did not contain the (TTTCA)n insertion. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction revealed that thesizes of (TTTCA)n insertion in all affected members were larger than 105 repeats.The same pentanucleotide insertion (ATTTCATTTC)58 has been reported to form RNAfoci resulting in neurotoxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 37, which suggeststhe similar pathogenic process in familial cortical myoclonic tremor withepilepsy type 1.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Brain Somatic Mutations in MTOR Disrupt Neuronal Ciliogenesis, Leading to Focal Cortical Dyslamination.",/pubmed/29937275,"Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs), including focal corticaldysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME), are major etiologies of pediatricintractable epilepsies exhibiting cortical dyslamination. Brain somatic mutationsin MTOR have recently been identified as a major genetic cause of FMCDs. However,the molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to cortical dyslaminationremains poorly understood.ÊHere, using patient tissue, genome-edited cells,Êandmouse models with brain somatic mutations in MTOR, we discovered that disruption of neuronal ciliogenesis by the mutations underlies cortical dyslamination inFMCDs. We found thatÊabnormal accumulation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites dueto perturbed autophagy was responsible for the defective neuronal ciliogenesis.Additionally, we found that disrupted neuronal ciliogenesis accounted forcortical dyslaminationÊinÊFMCDs by compromising Wnt signals essentialÊforneuronal polarization.

Convulsive status epilepticus management in adults and children: Report of the Working Group of the Polish Society of Epileptology.,/pubmed/29937151,"INTRODUCTION: The Working Group was established at the initiative of the General Board of the Polish Society of Epileptology (PSE) to develop an expert positionon the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus (SE) in adults and children in Poland. Generalized convulsive SE is the most common form and also represents thegreatest threat to life, highlighting the importance of the choice of appropriatetherapeutic treatment.AIM OF GUIDELINE: We present the therapeutic options separately for treatmentduring the early preclinical (>5-30min), established (30-60min), and refractory(>60min) SE phases. This division is based on time and response to AEDs, andindicates a practical approach based on pathophysiological data.RESULTS: Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the first-line drugs. In cases of ineffective first-line treatment and persistence of the seizure, the use of second-linetreatment: phenytoin, valproic acid or phenobarbital is required. SE thatpersists after the administration of benzodiazepines and phenytoin or anothersecond-line AED at appropriate doses is defined as refractory and drug resistant and requires treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). EEG monitoring isessential during therapy at this stage. Anesthesia is typically continued for an initial period of 24h followed by a slow reversal and is re-established ifseizures recur. Anesthesia is usually administered either to the level of the""burst suppression pattern"" or to obtain the ""EEG suppression"" pattern.CONCLUSIONS: Experts agree that close and early cooperation with a neurologistand anesthetist aiming to reduce the risk of pharmacoresistant cases is anextremely important factor in the treatment of patients with SE. This report has educational, practical and organizational aspects, outlining a standard plan for SE management in Poland that will improve therapeutic efficacy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of lamotrigine on in vivo and in vitro cytokine secretion in murine model of inflammation.,/pubmed/29937116,"Alteration in cytokine levels, particularly, IL-6, TNF-_, IL-1_ and IL-2, hasbeen implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine(LTG), an antiepileptic drug with mood stabilizing properties, has documentedimmunomodulatory effects. However, its effect on cytokine secretion in vivo hasnot been examined. Besides, studies have reported inconsistent results of the in vitro effects of LTG on cytokine secretion. Hence, we used murine models ofinflammation to characterize the in vivo and the in vitro effects of LTG on thesecretion of the aforementioned cytokines, using ELISA. LTG significantlyinhibited basal and mitogen-induced IL-6, TNF-_ and IL-1_ secretion in vivo andin LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells in vitro. In PMs, LTG inhibited basal andLPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-_ secretion. Our findings extend the currentunderstanding of the anti-inflammatory properties of LTG and may be relevant toits role in modulating the immune system in epilepsy and bipolar disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Progress in gene and cell therapies for the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.,/pubmed/29936867,"INTRODUCTION: The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a subset of lysosomalstorage diseases (LSDs) that cause myoclonic epilepsy, loss of cognitive andmotor function, degeneration of the retina leading to blindness, and early death.Most are caused by loss-of-function mutations in either lysosomal proteins ortransmembrane proteins. Current therapies are supportive in nature. NCLsinvolving lysosomal enzymes are amenable to therapies that provide an exogenoussource of protein, as has been used for other LSDs. Those that involvetransmembrane proteins, however, require new approaches. Areas covered: Thisreview will discuss potential gene and cell therapy approaches that have been,are, or may be in development for these disorders and those that have enteredclinical trials. Expert opinion: In animal models, gene therapy approaches haveproduced remarkable improvements in neurological function and lifespan. However, a complete cure has not been reached for any NCL, and a better understanding ofthe limits of the current crop of vectors is needed to more fully address thesediseases. The prospects for gene therapy, particularly those that can bedelivered systemically and treat both the brain and peripheral tissue, are high. The future is beginning to look bright for NCL patients and their families.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Transient Morphological Alterations in the Hippocampus After Pentylenetetrazole-Induced Seizures in Rats.,/pubmed/29936569,"The relationships between seizures, neuronal death, and epilepsy remain one ofthe most disputed questions in translational neuroscience. Although it is broadlyaccepted that prolonged and repeated seizures cause neuronal death andepileptogenesis, whether brief seizures can produce a mild but similar effect is controversial. In the present work, using a rat pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model ofseizures, we evaluated how a single episode of clonic-tonic seizures affected theviability of neurons in the hippocampus, the area of the brain most vulnerable toseizures, and morphological changes in the hippocampus up to 1Êweek after PTZtreatment (recovery period). The main findings of the study were: (1) PTZ-inducedseizures caused the transient appearance of massively shrunken, hyperbasophilic, and hyperelectrondense (dark) cells but did not lead to detectable neuronal cell loss. These dark neurons were alive, suggesting that they could cope withseizure-related dysfunction. (2) Neuronal and biochemical alterations followingseizures were observed for at least 1Êweek. The temporal dynamics of theappearance and disappearance of dark neurons differed in different zones of thehippocampus. (3) The numbers of cells with structural and functionalabnormalities in the hippocampus after PTZ-induced seizures decreased in thefollowing order: CA1_>_CA3b,c_>_hilus_>_dentate gyrus. Neurons in the CA3asubarea were most resistant to PTZ-induced seizures. These results suggest thateven a single seizure episode is a potent stressor of hippocampal neurons andthat it can trigger complex neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of telephone with face to face consultation for follow up of Neurocysticercosis.,/pubmed/29936301,"OBJECTIVES: There is significant scarcity of specialists to provide care forchildren with epilepsy in many parts of the world. Telemedicine is a potentialfuture option. This study was planned to estimate the diagnostic accuracy oftelephone consultation to identify Critical Clinical Events (breakthroughseizures, drug non-compliance, drug adverse events, features of raisedintracranial pressure, and other disease-related events),compared to theFace-to-Face consultation (gold standard), in children with Neurocysticercosis(NCC) and symptomatic seizures, following the completion of cysticidal therapy.METHODS: Children aged 2-15 years attending a tertiary health care facility with a diagnosis of NCC and symptomatic seizures were enrolled after completion of thecysticidal therapy. The parents were contacted by a Pediatric Neurology Resident on Telephone before the scheduled hospital visit. Subsequently, all the children were seen directly in hospital the next day by another Pediatric NeurologyResident. The information was noted on a structured questionnaire. The diagnosticaccuracy of telephone consultation for identifying the Critical Clinical Eventswas estimated using Face-to-Face consultation as the gold standard.RESULTS: A total of 1145 potential events were evaluated. Of these, theface-to-face consultation identified 56 events that would need hospital visit fordetailed evaluation (breakthrough seizures in 19, drug non-compliance in 15,adverse drug events in 11, features of raised intracranial pressure in 8, andother disease-related events in 3), and 1089 events that did not require hospitalconsultation. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictivevalues of telephone consultation were 89.28% (78.12-95.96), 97.61% (96.52-98.43),65.79% (54.01-76.30), and 99.43% (98.78-99.79) respectively. The likelihoodratios when telephone consultation was positive and negative were 37.3 and 0.11respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: Telephone consultation is an acceptable mode of follow-up forchildren with mild Neurocysticercosis and symptomatic seizures after completionof cysticidal therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Whole-brain MEG connectivity-based analyses reveals critical hubs in childhood absence epilepsy.,/pubmed/29936300,"Absence seizures are thought to be linked to abnormal interplays between regions of a thalamocortical network. However, the complexity of this widespread network makes characterizing the functional interactions among various brain regionschallenging. Using whole-brain functional connectivity and network analysis ofmagnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we explored pre-treatment brain hubs (""highly connected nodes"") of patients aged 6 to 12 years with childhood absence epilepsy.We analyzed ictal MEG data of 74 seizures from 16 patients. We employed atime-domain beamformer technique to estimate MEG sources in broadband (1-40_Hz)where the greatest power changes between ictal and preictal periods wereidentified. A phase synchrony measure, phase locking value, and a graph theorymetric, eigenvector centrality (EVC), were utilized to quantify voxel-levelconnectivity and network hubs of ictal_>_preictal periods, respectively. Avolumetric atlas containing 116 regions of interests (ROIs) was utilized tosummarize the network measures. ROIs with EVC (z-score) > 1.96 were reported ascritical hubs. ROIs analysis revealed functional-anatomical hubs in a widespread network containing bilateral precuneus (right/left, z_=_2.39, 2.18), leftthalamus (z_=_2.28), and three anterior cerebellar subunits of lobule ""IV-V""(z_=_3.9), vermis ""IV-V"" (z_=_3.57), and lobule ""III"" (z_=_2.03). Findingssuggest that highly connected brain areas or hubs are present in focal cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions during absence seizures. Hubs in thalami,precuneus and cingulate cortex generally support a theory of rapidly engaging andbilaterally distributed networks of cortical and subcortical regions responsible for seizures generation, whereas hubs in anterior cerebellar regions may belinked to terminating motor automatisms frequently seen during typical absenceseizures. Whole-brain network connectivity is a powerful analytic tool to reveal focal components of absence seizures in MEG. Our investigations can lead to abetter understanding of the pathophysiology of CAE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The development and validation of clinical exome-based panels using ExomeSlicer: Considerations and proof of concept using an Epilepsy panel.,/pubmed/29936260,"Exome-based panels are becoming the preferred diagnostic strategy in clinicallaboratories. This approach enables dynamic gene content update and, if needed,cost-effective reflex to whole exome sequencing. There are currently noguidelines or appropriate resources to support the clinical implementation ofexome-based panels. Here, we highlight principles and important considerationsfor the clinical development and validation of exome-based panels. In addition,we developed ExomeSlicer, a novel, web-based resource, which uses empiricalexon-level next-generation sequencing quality metrics to predict and visualizetechnically challenging exome-wide regions in any gene(s) of interest. Exomesequencing data from 100 clinical epilepsy cases was used to illustrate theclinical utility of ExomeSlicer in predicting poor quality regions and its impacton streamlining the ad hoc Sanger sequencing fill in burden. Using ExomeSlicer, >2,100 low complexity and/or high homology regions impacting >1,615 genes acrossthe exome were also characterized. These regions can be a source of falsepositive or false negative variant calls, which can lead to misdiagnoses intested patients and/or inaccurate functional annotations. We provide importantconsiderations and a novel resource for the clinical development of exome-basedpanels.",N,,,,,,,,,,
In search of antiepileptogenic treatments for post-traumatic epilepsy.,/pubmed/29936231,"Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) occurs in 20% of individuals with acquiredepilepsy, and can impact significantly the quality of life due to the seizuresand other functional or cognitive and behavioral outcomes of the traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTE. There is no available antiepileptogenic or diseasemodifying treatment for PTE. Animal models of TBI and PTE have been developed,offering useful insights on the value of inflammatory, neurodegenerativepathways, hemorrhages and iron accumulation, calcium channels and other targetpathways that could be used for treatment development. Most of the existingpreclinical studies test efficacy towards pathologies of functional recoveryafter TBI, while a few studies are emerging testing the effects towards inducedor spontaneous seizures. Here we review the existing preclinical trials testingnew candidate treatments for TBI sequelae and PTE, and discuss future directions for efforts aiming at developing antiepileptogenic and disease-modifyingtreatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Algorithm for automatic detection of spontaneous seizures in rats with post-traumatic epilepsy.,/pubmed/29936072,"BACKGROUND: Labor intensive electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a majorbottleneck to identifying anti-epileptogenic treatments in experimental models ofpost-traumatic epilepsy. We aimed to develop an algorithm for automated seizuredetection in experimental post-traumatic epilepsy.NEW METHOD: Continuous (24/7) 1-month-long video-EEG monitoring with threeepidural screw electrodes was started 154 d after lateral fluid-percussioninduced traumatic brain injury (TBI; n_=_97) or sham-injury (n_=_29) in adultmale Sprague-Dawley rats. First, an experienced researcher screened a total of90,720_h of digitized recordings on a computer screen to annotate the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. The same files were then analyzed using an algorithm in Spike2 (ver.9), which searching for temporally linked power peaks (14-42_Hz) inall three EEG channels, and then positive events were marked as a probableseizures. Finally, an experienced researcher confirmed all seizure candidatesvisually on the computer screen.RESULTS: Visual analysis identified 197 seizures in 29 rats. Automatic detection identified 4346 seizure candidates in 109 rats, of which 202 in the same 29 rats were true positives, resulting in a false positive rate of 0.046/h or 1.10/d. Thealgorithm demonstrated 5% specificity and 100% sensitivity. The algorithmanalyzed 1-month 3-channel EEG in 7 cohorts in 2_h, whereas analysis by anexperienced technician took ~500_h.COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The algorithm had 100% sensitivity. Itperformed slightly better and was substantially faster thaninvestigator-performed visual analysis.CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel seizure detection algorithm for automateddetection of seizures in a rat model of post-traumatic epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation of neuronal auto-antibodies in children diagnosed with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown cause.,/pubmed/29935963,"AIM: Cryptogenic forms of epileptic encephalopathies (EE) with their well-knownfeatures of drug-resistance, mental deterioration and partial response toimmunotherapies are ideal candidates for screening for neuronal autoantibodies(NAA).METHOD: Fifty consecutive pediatric patients with a diagnosis of EE of unknowncause were included. Nine NAAs were tested by ELISA, RIA or cell-based assays.Clinical features of seronegative and seropositive patients were compared.RESULTS: NAAs were found in 7/50 (14%) patients. They were N-methyl-d-aspartatereceptor in two (4%), glycine receptor in two (4%), contactin-associatedprotein-like 2 in one (2%), glutamic acid decarboxylase in one (2%) and type Agamma aminobutyric acid receptor in one patient (2%). Furthermore, serum IgGs of two patients negative for well-characterized NAAs, showed strong reactivity with the uncharacterized membrane antigens of live hippocampal neurons. There were no significant differences between seropositive and seronegative patients by meansof epilepsy duration, anti-epileptic drug resistance, EE type, types of seizures,seizure frequencies, EEG features or coexisting autoimmune diseases. Someseropositive patients gave good-moderate response to immunotherapy.DISCUSSION: Potential clues for the possible role of autoimmunity in seropositivepatients with EE were atypical prognosis of the classical EE type, atypicalprogression and unusual neurological findings like dyskinesia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A patient with a GNAO1 mutation with decreased spontaneous movements, hypotonia, and dystonic features.",/pubmed/29935962,"We report on a 4-year-old girl with a de novo GNAO1 mutation who had neurologicalfindings, including decreased spontaneous movements, hypotonia, and dystonicfeatures. She was referred to our hospital because of delayed psychomotordevelopment. She showed hypotonia and decreased spontaneous movements. Voluntary movements of the limbs were more frequent in the lower extremities than in theupper extremities. Occasional dyskinetic features, such as awkward hand/footposturing and grimacing, were seen during the voluntary movements. Serummetabolic screening, head magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography were unremarkable. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in thepatient's GNAO1 gene, c.709 G_>_A (p.E237K). We calculated the free-energy changeusing the FoldX Suite to evaluate the impact of the E237K mutation. The FoldXcalculations showed an increased free-energy change in the active state of theGNAO1 protein, indicating that the E237K mutation destabilizes the active statecomplexes. No seizures, chorea, tremor, or myoclonia, which are frequentlyreported in patients with GNAO1 mutations, were observed as of the last followup. Our patient will improve the understanding of early neurological features in patients with GNAO1 mutations.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Multi-component intrinsic brain activities as a safe, alternative to cortical stimulation for sensori-motor mapping in neurosurgery.",/pubmed/29935961,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of multi-component electrocorticography(ECoG)-based mapping using ""wide-spectrum, intrinsic-brain activities"" foridentifying the primary sensori-motor area (S1-M1) by comparing that usingelectrical cortical stimulation (ECS).METHODS: We evaluated 14 epilepsy patients with 1514 subdural electrodesimplantation covering the perirolandic cortices at Kyoto University Hospitalbetween 2011 and 2016. We performed multi-component, ECoG-based mapping(band-pass filter, 0.016-300/600_Hz) involving combined analyses of the singlecomponents: movement-related cortical potential (<0.5-1_Hz), event-relatedsynchronization (76-200_Hz), and event-related de-synchronization (8-24_Hz) toidentify the S1-M1. The feasibility of multi-component mapping was assessedthrough comparisons with single-component mapping and ECS.RESULTS: Among 54 functional areas evaluation, ECoG-based maps showedsignificantly higher rate of localization concordances with ECS maps when thethree single-component maps were consistent than when those were inconsistentwith each other (p_<_0.001 in motor, and p_=_0.02 in sensory mappings).Multi-component mapping revealed high sensitivity (89-90%) and specificity(94-97%) as compared with ECS.CONCLUSIONS: Wide-spectrum, multi-component ECoG-based mapping is feasible,having high sensitivity/specificity relative to ECS.SIGNIFICANCE: This safe (non-stimulus) mapping strategy, alternative to ECS,would allow clinicians to rule in/out the possibility of brain function prior to resection surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Characteristics of the knowledge and attitudes of parents about epilepsy.,/pubmed/29935908,"AIM: The aim of the study was to identify the knowledge and attitudes of parents about epilepsy.METHODS: Our study was conducted as a questionnaire study with 1200 parents. The demographic information of the participants, their answers to general questionsabout epilepsy, and their self-reported epilepsy knowledge scale and epilepsyattitude scale data were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 746 (62.2%) mothers and 454 (37.8%) fathers participated inthe study. The mean age was 36.3_±_9.2_years. The educational level was highschool or higher in 65.3%. The mothers and the fathers had similar epilepsyknowledge levels and epilepsy attitude characteristics. The highest epilepsyknowledge level and the best attitudes about epilepsy according to theeducational level was in the ""university or higher"" group. Moreover, a positivecorrelation was found between the epilepsy knowledge level and positive epilepsy attitudes of the parents.CONCLUSION: A more positive attitude and better knowledge about epilepsy withincreasing educational level indicate that negative attitudes are caused by lack of information. Positive attitudes in the society toward patients with epilepsywould be expected to increase by ensuring a sufficient level of knowledge aboutepilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neuropsychiatric features of the coexistence of epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.,/pubmed/29935759,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate demographic, epidemiologic and psychiatric featuressuggestive of the coexistence epilepsy (ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures(PNES) that may contribute to precocious suspicion of the association.METHODS: In this exploratory study, all patients older than 16_years admitted to prolonged video-electroencephalogram monitoring were evaluated about demographic,epileptological and psychiatric features. Detailed psychiatric assessment usingM.I.N.I.-plus 5.0, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and theChildhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was performed. Data were collected previous to the final diagnosis and patients with ES-only, PNES-only or coexistence ofES/PNES were compared.RESULTS: Of 122 patients admitted to epilepsy monitoring unit, 86 patients wereincluded and 25 (29%) had PNES. Twelve (14%) had PNES-only, 13 (15%) had ES/PNES and the remaining 61 (71%) had only ES. A coexistence of ES and PNES wasassociated with clinical report of more than one seizure type (p_0.001),nonspecific white matter hyperintensities on MRI (p_<_.001) and a past ofpsychotic disorder (p_=_.005). In addition, these patients had significantly moreemotional abuse and neglect (p_<_.002 and 0.001, respectively). Somatization(including conversion disorder) was the most common diagnosis in patients withPNES- only (83%) and co-existing of PNES and ES (69.2%), differentiating bothfrom ES-only patients (p_<_.001).CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of this coexistence ES/PNES in this studyreinforces a need to properly investigate PNES, especially in patients withconfirmed ES who become refractory to medical treatment with antiepileptic drugs.The neuropsychiatric assessment may help to diagnostic suspicion and in theplanning of therapeutic interventions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Inverted-U response of lacosamide on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and oxidative stress in C57BL/6 mice is independent of hippocampal collapsin response mediator protein-2.,/pubmed/29935443,"OBJECTIVE: Currently, lacosamide (LCM) is not approved for use in statusepilepticus (SE) but several shreds of evidence are available to support its use.The present study was, therefore, undertaken to evaluate the effect of LCM onpilocarpine (PILO) induced SE and neurodegeneration in C57BL/6 mice and toascertain the involvement of CRMP-2 in mediating above effect.METHODS: Pilocarpine-induced SE model was developed to explore the effect of LCM 20, 40 and 80_mg/kg in mice. We assessed the seizure severity, seizure latency,spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) and motor coordination by behavioralobservation. Histopathological evaluation and measurement of the levels ofCRMP-2, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were carried out inmice hippocampus.RESULTS: LCM exhibited a biphasic effect i.e., protection against SE at 20_mg/kg and 40_mg/kg dose whilst aggravated seizure-like behavior and mortality at80_mg/kg. Further, it increased percentage alternation (i.e., restored spatialmemory) in SAB and elevated motor impairment with increasing dose.Histologically, LCM 20_mg/kg and 40_mg/kg (but not 80_mg/kg) reducedneurodegeneration. LCM 20_mg/kg and 40_mg/kg reversed the elevated MDA and GSHlevels while 80_mg/kg showed a tendency to increase oxidative stress. Incontrast, LCM (at all doses) reversed the pilocarpine-induced elevation ofcollapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2).CONCLUSION: LCM protected against pilocarpine-induced SE, associatedneurodegeneration and improved pilocarpine-associated impairment of spatialmemory. The study reveals that CRMP-2 may not be mediating theinverted-U-response of LCM at least in pilocarpine model. Therefore, theanti-oxidant effect of LCM (and not its ability to modulate CRMP-2) wasanticipated as the mechanism underlying neuroprotection.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Correlation between clinical and cognitive aspects and nutritional indicators of elderly patients with new-onset epilepsy.,/pubmed/29935414,"OBJECTIVE: Nutritional indicators were correlated with cognitive and clinicalaspects of 25 elderly patients with new-onset epilepsy (EPWE). The nutritionalindicators of the EPWE were compared with those of a similar control group at asignificance level of p_<_0.05.RESULTS: There was lower cognitive performance, greater risk of malnutrition and muscle tissue depletion, and higher waist circumference (WC) in the EPWE. Longer epilepsy duration was correlated with loss of muscle mass (Pearson's correlation:0.433; p_=_0.044). Performance in the verbal fluency test, in the clock-drawingtest, and in the immediate memory test was negatively associated with body fat.Better performance in the image recognition test was negatively associated withthe indicators of muscle reserve.CONCLUSION: There was lower cognitive performance, higher risk of malnutrition,and high abdominal obesity in EPWE. Cognitive performance was related toadiposity. Cognitive impairment and longer disease duration are related toincreased nutritional risk.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The serumadiponectin, IL-6, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status levels(TOS) and oxidative stress index (OS_) were determined.RESULTS: The mean serum adiponectin and TAS levels were significantly lower inthe refractory epilepsy patients than in the healty controls, and mean IL-6, TOS and OS_ levels were significantly higher. The serum adiponectin, IL-6, TAS, TOSand OSI levels were not significantly different between the well-controlledepilepsy patients and the healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: The mean serum IL-6 and oxidative stress levels in refractoryepilepsy patients were higher and the serum adiponectin level was lower than the healthy control group. These findings may be associated with an increased risk ofseizures, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in refractory epilepsypatients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-epileptogenic and Anti-convulsive Effects of Fingolimod in Experimental Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.,/pubmed/29934763,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) represents a devastating neurological condition, in which approximately 4/5 of patients remain refractory for anti-convulsive drugs. Epilepsy surgery biopsies often reveal the damage pattern of ""hippocampalsclerosis"" (HS) characterized not only by neuronal loss but also pronouncedastrogliosis and inflammatory changes. Since TLE shares distinct pathogeneticaspects with multiple sclerosis (MS), we have here scrutinized therapeuticeffects in experimental TLE of the immunmodulator fingolimod, which isestablished in MS therapy. Fingolimod targets sphingosine-phosphate receptors(S1PRs). mRNAs of fingolimod target S1PRs were augmented in two experimental poststatus epilepticus (SE) TLE mouse models (suprahippocampal kainate/pilocarpine). SE frequently induces chronic recurrent seizures after an extended latencyreferred to as epileptogenesis. Transient fingolimod treatment of mice duringepileptogenesis after suprahippocampal kainate-induced SE revealed substantialreduction of chronic seizure activity despite lacking acute attenuation of SEitself. Intriguingly, fingolimod exerted robust anti-convulsive activity inkainate-induced SE mice treated in the chronic TLE stage and had neuroprotective and anti-gliotic effects and reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltrates. Finally, theexpression profile of fingolimod target-S1PRs in human hippocampal biopsy tissue of pharmacoresistant TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for seizure relief suggests repurposing of fingolimod as novel therapeutic perspective in focalepilepsies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Amygdala enlargement and emotional responses in (autoimmune) temporal lobe epilepsy.,/pubmed/29934574,"Temporal lobe epilepsy with amygdala enlargement (TLE-AE) is increasinglyrecognized as a distinct adult electroclinical syndrome. However, functionalconsequences of morphological alterations of the amygdala in TLE-AE are poorlyunderstood. Here, two emotional stimulation designs were employed to investigate subjective emotional rating and skin conductance responses in a sample oftreatment-nave patients with suspected or confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE (n_=_12)in comparison to a healthy control group (n_=_16). A subgroup of patientscompleted follow-up measurements after treatment. As compared to healthycontrols, patients with suspected or confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE showed markedly attenuated skin conductance responses and arousal ratings, especially pronounced for anxiety-inducing stimuli. The degree of right amygdala enlargement wassignificantly correlated with the degree of autonomic arousal attenuation.Furthermore, a decline of amygdala enlargement following prompt aggressiveimmunotherapy in one patient suffering from severe confirmed autoimmune TLE-AEwith a very recent clinical onset was accompanied by a significant improvement ofautonomic responses. Findings suggest dual impairments of autonomic and cognitivediscrimination of stimulus arousal as hallmarks of emotional processing inTLE-AE. Emotional responses might, at least partially, recover after successfultreatment, as implied by first single case data.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Incidence of childhood epilepsy: A population-based study in rural Japan.,/pubmed/29934113,"INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a common childhood neurological condition and a majorpublic health concern worldwide. A higher incidence of epilepsy is reported inlow- and middle-income countries, particularly in rural areas. However, noJapanese reports on the incidence of childhood epilepsy have been published inthe past 25 years. We estimated the annual incidence of epilepsy in children aged1-14 years in Uwajima, a city in a rural, relatively isolated area of Japan.METHODS: Candidates were extracted from Japan's public insurance databasefollowing the International Classification of Diseases code for epilepsy.Epilepsy was defined as two or more unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart,as per the International League Against Epilepsy definition. The study sample wasdivided into three cohorts based on age at diagnosis: 1-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years. The incidence of epilepsy was calculated as the number of children with epilepsy divided by the person-years in each cohort.RESULTS: The annual incidence rate of epilepsy in children aged 1-14 years was70.4/100,000 children (95% confidence interval, 44.8-96.0). There was nosignificant difference in incidence between boys and girls. This rate was similarto those reported in other countries, although the incidence in children aged 1-4years was slightly higher in our study than in other countries.CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of childhood epilepsy in rural areas of Japan isgenerally comparable with rates of childhood epilepsy reported in othercountries.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Group analyses were conducted pre-and post-ATL of a novelty complex scene-encoding paradigm comparing areas ofblood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activations on functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI). None of the pre-operative patient characteristics westudied predicted the extent of pre- to post-operative memory loss. On fMRI,extra-temporal activations were detected pre-operatively in both LTLE and RTLE,particularly in the frontal lobe. Greater activations also were noted in thecontralateral hippocampus and parahippocampus in both groups.

We found that, in the patient&rsquo;s cells, besides rescuing thewild-type-like mitochondrial morphology, CNF1 administration is able to trigger asignificant increase in cellular content of ATP and of the mitochondrial outermembrane marker Tom20. These results were accompanied by a profound F-actinreorganization in MERRF fibroblasts, which is a typical CNF1-induced effect oncell cytoskeleton.

Thisstudy aimed to compare the impacts of various child-related (pain, epilepsy,repositioning, medical care) and environment-related (light, noise, TV/radio,open door) factors on sleep in this vulnerable population. Data were obtainedthrough the &ldquo;Sleep Questionnaire for Children with Severe PsychomotorImpairment&rdquo; (SNAKE) by proxy assessment. n = 212 children (mean age: 10.4years) were included in the analyses. Logistic and linear regression models were used to compare child- and environment-related factors against the global rating of children&rsquo;s sleep quality, five SNAKE scales, children&rsquo;s sleepduration, and sleep efficacy. Pain increased the risk of sleeping poorlyfour-fold (OR (odds ratio) = 4.13; 95% CI (confidence interval): 1.87_9.13) andpredicted four sleep problems as assessed by the SNAKE. Children who needed toreposition during the night were at three times greater risk of sleeping poorly(OR = 3.08; 95% CI: 1.42_6.69). Three of the five SNAKE scales were predictedthrough nocturnal repositioning. Repositioning and epilepsy predicted a reducedsleep duration and low sleep efficacy. None of the environment-related factorsexhibited statistically significant results. This study emphasizes the urgentneed for reliable pain detection in the context of sleep disturbances in severelyill children.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Next-generation sequencing improves treatment efficacy and reduces hospitalization in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.,/pubmed/29933521,"BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study were three-fold: (i) to determine thecontribution of known genes to the causation of a broad-spectrum of pediatricdrug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), (ii) to compare the diagnostic yield and costamong different next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, and especially (iii)to assess how NGS approaches can benefit patients by improving diagnosis andtreatment efficiency.METHODS: This study enrolled 273 pediatric DRE patients with no obvious acquired etiology. Seventy-four patients underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES), 141patients had epilepsy-related gene panel testing, and another 58 patients hadclinical WES gene panel testing. We obtained these patients' seizure andhospitalization frequency by periodic follow-up phone calls and outpatientvisits.RESULTS: Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 86 patients (31.5%) and involved 93likely disease-causing mutations in 33 genes. In this study, the detection rates of the epilepsy-related gene panel, the clinical WES gene panel, and WES were32.6% (46/141), 44.8% (26/58), and 17.3% (13/74), respectively. Moreover, 34patients accepted corrective therapy according to their mutant genes, after which52.9% (18/34) became seizure-free and 38.2% (13/34) achieved seizure reduction.In the end, patients with either positive or negative genetic results hadsignificantly fewer hospitalization incidents (times/half year) than before(positive genetic results group 0.58Ê±Ê1.14 vs 0.10Ê±Ê0.26; negative geneticresults group 0.72Ê±Ê1.65 vs 0.12Ê±Ê0.33).CONCLUSIONS: These results offer further proof that NGS approaches representpowerful tools for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, this studyindicated how NGS can improve treatment efficacy and reduce hospitalization inchildren with DRE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Integration of resting state functional MRI into clinical practice - A large single institution experience.,/pubmed/29933375,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool forpre-surgical evaluation of eloquent cortex. Classic task-based paradigms require patient participation and individual imaging sequence acquisitions for eachfunctional domain that is being assessed. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), however, enables functional localization without patient participation and can evaluatenumerous functional domains with a single imaging session. To date,post-processing of this resting state data has been resource intensive, whichlimits its widespread application for routine clinical use. Through a novelautomated algorithm and advanced imaging IT structure, we report the clinicalapplication and the large-scale integration of rs-fMRI into routine neurosurgicalpractice. One hundred and ninety one consecutive patients underwent a 3T rs-fMRI,83 of whom also underwent both motor and language task-based fMRI. Data wereprocessed using a novel, automated, multi-layer perceptron algorithm andintegrated into stereotactic navigation using a streamlined IT imaging pipeline. One hundred eighty-five studies were performed for intracranial neoplasm, 14 for refractory epilepsy and 33 for vascular malformations or other neurologicaldisorders. Failure rate of rs-fMRI of 13% was significantly better than that for task-based fMRI (38.5%,) (p <0.001). In conclusion, at Washington University inSt. Louis, rs-fMRI has become an integral part of standard imaging forneurosurgical planning. Resting state fMRI can be used in all patients, and dueto its lower failure rate than task-based fMRI, it is useful for patients who areunable to cooperate with task-based studies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A qualitative examination and theoretical model of anxiety in adults with epilepsy.,/pubmed/29933209,"OBJECTIVE: There is an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders among people withepilepsy, and the comorbidity of anxiety in epilepsy is associated with adversemedical and psychosocial outcomes. Despite its importance, little is known about what psychosocial or epilepsy factors may be associated with the development ofanxiety. The aim of this qualitative study was to determine what factors mayexplain why some people with epilepsy develop anxiety disorders and others donot.METHODS: Adults with epilepsy were recruited from an outpatient epilepsy service.Semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 participants, 15 of whomreported clinically significant levels of anxiety. Grounded theory analysis wasused to develop a theoretical model of anxiety development in the context ofepilepsy.RESULTS: Qualitative analyses revealed a number of processes that appeared toaccount for the development of anxiety in the context of epilepsy. These includedinflated estimates regarding epilepsy-specific risks and excessive attempts toavoid these risks. Such excessive avoidance often resulted in greaterinterference with participants' role functioning, thus risking ongoing quality oflife. A number of premorbid and contextual factors also appear to be implicatedin the development of anxiety.CONCLUSION: This investigation provides a comprehensive account for thedevelopment of anxiety in epilepsy, which is consistent with existing theories ofanxiety development and maintenance. Importantly, this model provides afoundation for future research and appropriate treatment strategies to addressanxiety in people with epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Theory of Mind and social competence in children and adolescents with genetic generalised epilepsy (GGE): Relationships to epilepsy severity and anti-epileptic drugs.,/pubmed/29933178,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine Theory of Mind (ToM) and social competencein children and adolescents with genetic generalised epilepsy (GGE), and explore how they relate to neurocognitive and epilepsy variables.METHODS: Twenty-two children and adolescents with GGE (8-16 years old) and 22typically developing controls completed two behavioural tasks (faux-pas, strange stories) assessing cognitive and affective ToM, and a battery of standardisedneuropsychological tests. Parents completed questionnaires assessing ToM andsocial competence. Neurologists completed the Global Assessment Severity ofEpilepsy (GASE) scale to measure of epilepsy severity.RESULTS: Children and adolescents with GGE were impaired in both cognitive andaffective ToM, and had reduced social competence compared to controls, which was not attributable to low intellectual functioning or impaired executive skills(working memory, inhibition). Lower ToM correlated with reduced social competencein children and adolescents with GGE. Clinical variables identified included: (i)higher daily dosage of valproate, which was correlated with reduced affectiveToM, (ii) higher daily dosages of ethosuximide and lamotrigine, which werecorrelated with reduced social competence, and (iii) overall epilepsy severity onthe GASE, which was correlated with reduced social competence.CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed cognitive and affective ToM impairments inchildren and adolescents with GGE, which correlated with everyday socialproblems. Moreover, higher dosages of commonly prescribed anti-epileptic drugsand overall epilepsy severity were related to ToM impairments and socialcompetence problems. Although preliminary, these findings provide criticalinformation for detection and screening procedures for social difficulties inchildren and adolescents with GGE, which are currently lacking.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Seizures with Migraine-like Attacks after Radiation Therapy (SMART): A new meaning of an old acronym.,/pubmed/29933177,"Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) is a late-onsetcomplication of cerebral irradiation, clinically characterized by headache,seizures and focal deficits.

The new acronym,modified in its meaning but not in its form (SMART), better reflects the mainclinical features and may allow neurologists to recognize this condition moreeasily.",N,,,,,,,,,,
PCDH19-related epilepsy in a male with Klinefelter syndrome: Additional evidence supporting PCDH19 cellular interference disease mechanism.,/pubmed/29933145,"Heterozygous de novo or inherited pathogenic variants in the PCDH19 gene cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental features including developmental delay andseizures. PCDH19 epilepsy was previously known as ""epilepsy and mentalretardation limited to females"", since the condition almost exclusively affectsfemales. It is hypothesized that the co-existence of two populations of neurons, some with and some without PCDH19 protein expression, results in pathologicallyabnormal interactions between these neurons, a mechanism also referred to ascellular interference. Consequently, PCDH19-related epilepsies are inherited inan atypical X-linked pattern, such that hemizygous, non-mosaic, 46,XY males aretypically unaffected, while individuals with a disease-causing PCDH19 variant,mainly heterozygous females and mosaic males, are affected. As a corollary tothis hypothesis, an individual with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47,XXY) who has a heterozygous disease-causing PCDH19 variant should develop PCDH19-relatedepilepsy. Here, we report such evidence: - a male child with KS andPCDH19-related epilepsy - supporting the PCDH19 cellular interference diseasehypothesis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Imaging correlates of behavioral impairments: An experimental PET study in the rat pilocarpine epilepsy model.,/pubmed/29933054,"Psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in patients with epilepsy and greatlycontribute to the overall burden of disease. The availability of reliablebiomarkers to diagnose epilepsy-associated comorbidities would allow foreffective treatment and improved disease management. Due to their non-invasivenature, molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET)are ideal tools to measure pathologic changes. In the current study weinvestigated the potential of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) and2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine([18F]MPPF) as imaging correlates of neurobehavioral comorbidities in thepilocarpine rat model of epilepsy. Findings from rats with epilepsy revealed aregional reduction in [18F]FDG uptake indicating thalamic hypometabolism. Inaddition, an increase in septal [18F]MPPF binding was observed in rats withspontaneous recurrent seizures. Both thalamic [18F]FDG and septal [18F]MPPF data proved to correlate with behavioral alterations including decreases in luxurybehavior such as burrowing and social interaction, and changes in behavioralpatterns in anxiety tests. A correlation with seizure frequency was confirmed forthalamic [18F]FDG data. Moreover, thalamic [18F]FDG and septal [18F]MPPF dataexhibited a correlation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serumconcentrations, which were lowered in rats with epilepsy. In conclusion, _PETdata from rats with pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis indicate altered septal5-HT1A receptor binding. Further research is necessary assessing whether septal5-HT1A receptor binding may serve as an imaging correlate of neuropsychiatriccomorbidities in epilepsy patients and for severity assessment in rodent epilepsymodels. In contrast, we obtained evidence that [18F]FDG uptake also reflects the severity of epilepsy and, thus, might not constitute a biomarker with sufficient specificity for psychiatric comorbidities. Evidence has been obtained that BDNFmight serve as a peripheral circulatory biomarker. Further experimental andclinical assessment is necessary for validation of the marker candidates.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term risk of seizures among cardiac arrest survivors.,/pubmed/29932947,"INTRODUCTION: The long-term risk of seizures in cardiac arrest survivors is notestablished. We hypothesized that survivors of cardiac arrest face an increasedlong-term risk for seizures.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using 2008-2015 claims datafrom a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries ³66years-old. Our exposure of interest was a hospital diagnosis code of cardiacarrest, defined by previously validated ICD-9-CM codes. Since we were interested in long-term risk, we excluded patients with a history of seizure, and those who were diagnosed with a seizure during hospitalization or died during the indexhospitalization. Our outcome was a diagnosis of seizure. Survival statistics wereused to calculate seizure incidence and Cox proportional hazards models were usedto determine the association between cardiac arrest and long-term seizures after adjustment for demographics and Charlson comorbidities.RESULTS: Among 1,764,508 beneficiaries with a mean 4.5 years of follow-up, weidentified 57,437 patients with cardiac arrest who survived to discharge without a seizure. The annual incidence of seizures was 1.26% (95% confidence interval[CI], 1.20-1.33%) compared to 0.61% (95% CI, 0.61-0.62%) in other Medicarepatients. In unadjusted analysis, cardiac arrest was associated with an increasedrisk of post-discharge seizures (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9), butthe association was lost after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities (HR 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0; P_=_0.12).CONCLUSION: The long-term risk of seizures was not elevated in patients withcardiac arrest who survived to hospital discharge without a seizure.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impact of type of intracranial EEG sensors on link strengths of evolving functional brain networks.,/pubmed/29932428,"Objective and Approach: Investigating properties of evolving functional brainnetworks has become a valuable tool to characterize the complex dynamics of theepileptic brain. &#13; Such networks are usually derived fromelectroencephalograms (EEG) recorded with sensors implanted chronically intodeeper structures of the brain and/or placed onto the cortex.&#13; It is stillunclear, however, whether the use of different sensors for an identification ofnetwork nodes affects properties&#13; of functional brain networks.&#13; Weaddress this question by investigating properties of links of such networks that we characterize by assessing interactions in multi-sensor, multi-day EEG datarecorded from forty-nine epilepsy patients during presurgical evaluation.&#13;These data allow us to study the impact of different types of sensors togetherwith the impact of various physiologic and pathophysiologic activities onproperties of links.&#13; Main results: We observe that different types ofsensors differently impact on spatial means and temporal fluctuations of linkstrengths. &#13; Moreover, the impact depends on the relative anatomical locationof sensors with respect to location and extent of sources of the prevailingactivities. &#13; Significance: Type and location of sensors should be consideredwhen constructing networks.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Seizure outcome in pediatric medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy surgery: selective amygdalohippocampectomy versus anterior temporal lobectomy.,/pubmed/29932370,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate long-term seizure outcome,rate of reoperation, and postoperative neuropsychological performance followingselective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) inpediatric patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of cases of medicallyrefractory pediatric TLE treated initially with either SelAH or ATL. Standardizedpre- and postoperative evaluation included seizure charting, surface andlong-term video-electroencephalography, 1.5-T MRI, and neuropsychologicaltesting. RESULTS A total of 79 patients treated initially with SelAH (n = 18) or ATL (n = 61) were included in this study, with a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 4 years (range 1-16 years). The patients' average age at initial surgery was 10.6 ± 5years, with an average surgical delay of 5.7 ± 4 years between seizure onset and surgery. Seizure freedom (Engel I) following the initial operation wassignificantly more likely following ATL (47/61, 77%) than SelAH (8/18, 44%; p =0.017, Fisher's exact test). There was no statistically significant difference inthe proportion of patients with postoperative neuropsychological deficitsfollowing SelAH (8/18, 44%) or ATL (21/61, 34%). However, reoperation wassignificantly more likely following SelAH (8/18, 44%) than after ATL (7/61, 11%; p = 0.004) and was more likely to result in Engel I outcome for ATL after failed SelAH (7/8, 88%) than for posterior extension after failed ATL (1/7, 14%; p =0.01). Reoperation was well tolerated without significant neuropsychologicaldeterioration. Ultimately, including 15 reoperations, 58 of 79 (73%) patientswere free from disabling seizures at the most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS SelAHamong pediatric patients with medically refractory unilateral TLE yieldssignificantly worse rates of seizure control compared with ATL. Reoperation issignificantly more likely following SelAH, is not associated with incrementalneuropsychological deterioration, and frequently results in freedom fromdisabling seizures. These results are significant in that they argue againstusing SelAH for pediatric TLE surgery.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Changes in resting-state connectivity in pediatric temporal lobe epilepsy.,/pubmed/29932365,"OBJECTIVE Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) is a form offMRI that allows for analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent signal changeswithin a task-free, resting paradigm. This technique has been shown to haveefficacy in evaluating network connectivity changes with epilepsy. Presurgicaldata from patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were evaluated usingthe fcMRI technique to define connectivity changes within and between thediseased and healthy temporal lobes using a within-subjects design. METHODS Usingpresurgical fcMRI data from pediatric patients with unilateral temporal lobeepilepsy, the authors performed seed-based analyses within the diseased andhealthy temporal lobes. Connectivity within and between temporal lobe seeds wasmeasured and compared. RESULTS In the cohort studied, local ipsilateral temporal lobe connectivity was significantly increased on the diseased side compared tothe healthy temporal lobe. Connectivity of the diseased side to the healthy side,on the other hand, was significantly reduced when compared to connectivity of thehealthy side to the diseased temporal lobe. A statistically significantregression was observed when comparing the changes in local ipsilateral temporal lobe connectivity to the changes in inter-temporal lobe connectivity. Astatistically significant difference was also noted in ipsilateral connectivitychanges between patients with and those without mesial temporal sclerosis.CONCLUSIONS Using fcMRI, significant changes in ipsilateral temporal lobe andinter-temporal lobe connectivity can be appreciated in unilateral temporal lobeepilepsy. Furthermore, fcMRI may have a role in the presurgical evaluation ofpatients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A genetic locus for sensory epilepsy precipitated by contact with hot water maps to chromosome 9p24.3-p23.,/pubmed/29932058,"Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a rare form of sensory epilepsy where seizures areprecipitated by a stimulus of contact with hot water. While earlier studies have suggested causal role of genes for HWE, specific underpinnings are beginning tobe explored only recently. We carried out a whole genome-based linkage analysisin a family where most of its members affected by HWE and found evidence of apreviously unknown locus at chromosome 9p24.3-p23. Parametric two-point analysis suggested linkage with the greatest LOD score of 3.42 for the marker D9S286 at9p24.1 at recombination fraction (_) = 0, 90% penetrance value and 1% phenocopyrate. The highest multipoint LODscore of 3.42 was obtained for same marker at9p24. The critical genetic interval of about 10 Mb of DNA was defined by themarkers D9S917 and D9S168 corresponding to the centromere-distal andcentromere-proximal recombination boundaries, respectively. This observationalong with our previous findings of hot water genetic loci at 10q21.3-q22.3(OMIM: 613339) and 4q24-q28 (OMIM: 613340), indicates unanticipated geneticheterogeneity for the disorder in families from a relatively small geographicregion in the southern parts of India.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neurological and Psychological Changes in Hemodialysis Patients Before and After the Treatment.,/pubmed/29931746,"Neurological, psychological, and cognitive disorders in chronic kidney diseasemay contribute to poor quality of life in these patients.

Electroencephalogram (EEG), Minnesotamultiphasic personality inventory (MMPI-2) Satisfaction profile (SAT-P), andNeuropsychological test Global z-scores (NPZ5) were performed before (T0) andafter (T1) HD treatment and in HC. Renal function, inflammatory markers andmineral metabolism indexes were also evaluated. Patients did not show significantdifferences before and after HD in the absolute and relative power of band ofEEG, except in Theta/Alpha index (P <_0.001). At T1, HD patients showedsignificant differences in Beta, Delta and Theta band, in addition to Theta/alphaindex, with respect to HC. Moreover, HD patients showed significant differencesin specific MMPI-2 clinical and content scales, SAT-P domains and NPZ5 tests ofmemory and concentration with respect to HC. We also observed significantcorrelations between renal function, mineral metabolism, inflammatory markers andpsychocognitive alterations. In our sample EEG abnormalities tend to reduce, but not significantly, after HD treatment and differences remain present with respectto HC. In HD patients cognitive and psychological alterations were associatedwith reduced quality of life and correlated with mineral metabolism andinflammation. Modification in EEG and in psychological and cognitive parametersshould be assessed in a larger HD population to confirm our observation.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Can epilepsy be treated by antibiotics?,/pubmed/29931545,"There is mounting evidence for the role of the gut microbiota and gut-braininteractions in neurological diseases. We present six patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy who attained temporary seizure freedom during antibiotic treatment. The effect on seizure frequency waned within 2Êweeks after cessationof antibiotic treatment. We hypothesized that antibiotic treatments may have ashort-term effect, through gut microbiota disruption, on gut-brain interactionsand ultimately seizure frequency. This observed impact of antibiotics on seizure frequency hints at a possible role of the gut microbiota in epilepsy and itsmanifestations. This begs the question: can epilepsy be treated by antibiotics?Or perhaps in a broader sense: can alterations in the gut microbiota be used as atreatment modality in drug-resistant epilepsy?

Nucleocytoplasmic p27(Kip1) Export Is Required for ERK1/2-Mediated Reactive Astroglial Proliferation Following Status Epilepticus.,/pubmed/29930499,"Reactive astrogliosis is a prominent and ubiquitous reaction of astrocytes tomany types of brain injury. Up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) expression and astroglial proliferation are hallmarks of reactiveastrogliosis. However, the mechanisms that regulate reactive astrogliosis remain elusive. In the present study, status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizureactivity) led to reactive astrogliosis showing the increases in GFAP expressionand the number of proliferating astrocytes with prolonged extracellular signalreceptor-activated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and reduced nuclear p27Kip1level. U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, showed opposite effects. Leptomycin B (LMB),an inhibitor of chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), attenuated nucleocytoplasmicp27Kip1 export and astroglial proliferation, although it up-regulated ERK1/2phosphorylation and GFAP expression. Roscovitine ameliorated the reduced nuclear p27Kip1 level and astroglial proliferation without changing GFAP expression andERK1/2 phosphorylation. U0126 aggravated SE-induced astroglial apoptosis in themolecular layer of the dentate gyrus that was unaffected by LMB and roscovitine. In addition, U0126 exacerbated SE-induced neuronal death, while LMB mitigated it.Roscovitine did not affect SE-induced neuronal death. The present data elucidate for the first time the roles of nucleocytoplasmic p27Kip1 transport inERK1/2-mediated reactive astrogliosis independent of SE-induced neuronal deathand astroglial apoptosis. Therefore, our findings suggest that nucleocytoplasmic p27Kip1 export may be required for ERK1/2-mediated astroglial proliferationduring reactive astrogliosis, and that nuclear p27Kip1 entrapment may be apotential therapeutic strategy for anti-proliferation in reactive astrocytes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical and genetic spectrum of a large cohort of children with epilepsy in China.,/pubmed/29930392,"PURPOSE: Genetic diagnosis for children suffering from epilepsy has importantimplications for treatment, prognosis, and development of precision medicinestrategies.METHODS: We performed exome sequencing (ES) or targeted sequencing on 733children with epilepsy onset within the first year of life. We subgrouped ourpatients based on the onset age of seizure into neonatal and before 1 year (1-12 months), to compare the clinical and genetic features.RESULTS: The subgroups with different onset age of seizure showed differentpathogenic variant spectrum, and the 1-year age group was more likely to havedevelopmental delays than the neonate group (p_=_0.000614). The diagnostic ratewas 26.7% for targeted sequencing using a 2742-gene panel, and 42% for ES. Weidentified 12 genes, which covered 48.7% of diagnostic cases. Our data revealedthat 41.9% of patients in the neonate group and 49.7% patients in the 1-yeargroup had treatment options based on molecular diagnosis.CONCLUSION: The 12 most commonly implicated genes in this cohort and the geneswith treatment options should be considered as part of the essential panel forearly diagnosis of epilepsy onset, if large medical exome analyses or ES are not feasible as first-tier analysis.

The 50% responder rate was 26% at 3 monthsand increased to 49% at 36 months. Patients were more likely to continue the drugand less likely to have AEs with slower titration over >4 weeks (p_=_0.02 foreach). Four or more previously failed AEDs predicted poorer response ratecompared to three or less AEDs (p_=_0.001).CONCLUSION: LCM use in clinical practice was associated with greater rate ofseizure freedom than in clinical trials. Discontinuation and occurrence of AEswere significantly more likely with faster titration and adding LCM to NCBagents.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Calcification in cerebral parenchyma affects pharmacoresistant epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis.,/pubmed/29929111,"URPOSE: Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited diseasecaused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and results in the over-activationof the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is clinically used to treat hamartomatous lesionsas in TSC andits effect on controlling epilepsy is also reported in many studies. This studyaims to evaluate the risk factors of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC receiving long-term rapamycin treatment.METHOD: A total of 108 patients with TSC taking rapamycin for over 1 year wereenrolled in this study. Factors that might influence seizure control werestatistically analyzed by multiple factor analysis. A subgroup analysis was also conducted to access the relationship between calcified epileptic foci andpharmacoresistant epilepsy. (Clinical trial registration number:ChiCTR-OOB-15006535(2015-05-29)).RESULTS: Seizure was controlled in 53 patients but was not managed in 55 patientsconsidered to be drug resistant. Logistic regression analysis showed thatcalcification in the cerebral parenchyma was a risk factor of pharmacoresistantepilepsy [P_=_0.006, odds ratio (OR)_=_4.831 (1.577, 14.795)]. Fifteen of 17patients with calcified epileptic foci suffered from pharmacoresistant epilepsy(88.2%). Seizures in patients with calcified epileptic foci were probablypharmacoresistant (P_=_0.010).CONCLUSION: Calcification in epileptic foci strongly indicates pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC even when treated with appropriate anti-epilepsydrugs (AEDs) and rapamycin. Calcification can be used to evaluatepharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A UK survey of the experience of service provision for children and young people with epilepsy.,/pubmed/29929110,"PURPOSE: To survey patient and carer experience for children and young peoplewith epilepsy across the United Kingdom.METHODS: We used a Patient Reported Experience Measure methodology to exploreperceived satisfaction with their epilepsy service. A survey collected anonymisedproxy data on demography and illness severity, and perceptions of interactionwith clinicians, ease of access to the service and the quality and quantity ofepilepsy information provided. The questionnaire was completed by the child's or young person's carer or by the young person.RESULTS: Survey questionnaires were distributed across all of the 192 paediatric units providing epilepsy care for children in the UK. 145 units (75%) submitteddata and there were 2335 responses. 90% of young people and 86% of carers weresatisfied with the care they had received. Using multi-level logistic regression modelling, those factors most strongly affecting satisfaction were determined.While many proxies of illness severity adversely affected satisfaction,comorbidity did not. A dedicated clinic setting, perceived adequate informationand guidance on restrictions on their child, if any, all improved satisfaction.However, the significantly strongest factor influencing satisfaction was ""ease ofaccess"" to the service.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of collecting largepopulation sizes to allow a better understanding of the needs of children andyoung people accessing an epilepsy service. They allow the identification offactors most closely linked to patient satisfaction and provide potentiallyvaluable information on how to improve the quality of care of children and young people with epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Refractory epilepsy in preschool children with tuberous sclerosis complex: Early surgical treatment and outcome.,/pubmed/29929109,"PURPOSE: Epilepsy surgery has been shown to be effective in treating focalepilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We analyzed the advantageof early surgical management in terms of seizure frequency and development.METHOD: We retrospectively studied the 15 patients younger than 6 years whounderwent resective surgery between 2006 and 2016. Fourteen of them had invasive monitoring while the 15th was operated on under corticography.RESULTS: Epilepsy began before 5 months of age in all patients. Overall 13patients (86%) had a dramatic improvement of epilepsy after surgery (Engel 1 and 2) including 9 patients (60%) seizure free (Engel 1_A). In the group of 9patients younger than 20 months at the time of surgery who presented withcatastrophic epilepsies, 77% are Engel 1_A and the other 23% Engel 2. In thissubpopulation, no one developed autism and four (44%) regained normaldevelopment.CONCLUSIONS: In early onset epilepsies associated with TSC, surgical treatment ishighly effective, in particular when performed early. Invasive monitoringcontributes to the successful outcome. Those data have to be confirmed bymulticentric studies including quantitative analyses of the recordings.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Kcnj6(GIRK2) trisomy is not sufficient for conferring the susceptibility to infantile spasms seen in the Ts65Dn mouse model of down syndrome.,/pubmed/29929098,"OBJECTIVE: Infantile spasms (IS) is a catastrophic childhood seizure disorderthat is characterized by extensor and/or flexor spasms, cognitive deteriorationand a characteristic EEG abnormality. The latter consists of a pattern of aspike-wave followed by an electrodecremental response (EDR), which is aflattening of the EEG waveform amplitude. The mechanism/circuitry that underpins IS is unknown. Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are particularly vulnerable toIS. The standard mouse model of DS is the Ts65Dn mutant mouse (Ts). Using the Ts mouse, we have created an animal model of IS in DS. This model entails thetreatment of Ts mice with a GABABR agonist with a resultant recapitulation of thesemiological, electrographic, and pharmacological phenotype of IS. One of thegenes triplicated in Ts mice is the kcnj6 gene which codes for the G-proteininwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) protein. We have shown that over expression of GIRK2 in Ts brain is necessary for the production of the GABABRagonist induced IS phenotype in the Ts mouse. Here, we ask the question whetherthe excess GIRK2 is sufficient for the production of the GABABR agonist inducedIS phenotype.METHODS: To address this question, we used kcnj6 triploid mice, and compared the number of spasms via video analysis and EDR events via EEG to that of the WTmice.RESULTS: We now show that GABARR agonist-treated kcnj6 triploid mice failed toshow susceptibility to the IS phenotype. Therefore, over expression of GIRK2 inthe brain is necessary, but not sufficient to confer susceptibility to the GABABRagonist-induced IS phenotype in the Ts model of DS.SIGNIFICANCE: It is therefore likely that GIRK2 is working in concert withanother factor or factors that are altered in the Ts brain in the production ofthe GABABR agonist-induced IS phenotype.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Astroglial role in the pathophysiology of status epilepticus: an overview.,/pubmed/29928494,"Status epilepticus is a medical emergency with elevated morbidity and mortalityrates, and represents a leading cause of epilepsy-related deaths. Though statusepilepticus can occur at any age, it manifests more likely in children andelderly people. Despite the common prevalence of epileptic disorders, a complete explanation for the mechanisms leading to development of self-limited or longlasting seizures (as in status epilepticus) are still lacking. Apart fromneurons, research evidence suggests the involvement of immune and glial cells in epileptogenesis. Among glial cells, astrocytes represent an ideal target for the study of the pathophysiology of status epilepticus, due to their key role inhomeostatic balance of the central nervous system. During status epilepticus,astroglial cells are activated by the presence of cytokines, damage associatedmolecular patterns and reactive oxygen species. The persistent activation ofastrocytes leads to a decrease in glutamate clearance with a correspondingaccumulation in the synaptic extracellular space, increasing the chance ofneuronal excitotoxicity. Moreover, major alterations in astrocytic gap junctioncoupling, inflammation and receptor expression, facilitate the generation ofseizures. Astrocytes are also involved in dysregulation of inhibitorytransmission in the central nervous system and directly participate in ionichomeostatic alterations during status epilepticus. In the present review, wefocus on the functional and structural changes in astrocytic activity thatparticipate in the development and maintenance of status epilepticus, withspecial attention on concurrent inflammatory alterations. We also includepotential astrocytic treatment targets for status epilepticus.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Therapeutic potential of medicinal marijuana: an educational primer for health care professionals.,/pubmed/29928146,"With the proposed Canadian July 2018 legalization of marijuana through theCannabis Act, a thorough critical analysis of the current trials on the efficacy of medicinal marijuana (MM) as a treatment option is necessary. This review isparticularly important for primary care physicians whose patients may beinterested in using MM as an alternative therapy. In response to increasedinterest in MM, Health Canada released a document in 2013 for generalpractitioners (GPs) as an educational tool on the efficacy of MM in treating somechronic and acute conditions. Although additional studies have filled in some of the gaps since the release of the Health Canada document, conflicting andinconclusive results continue to pose a challenge for physicians. This reviewaims to supplement the Health Canada document by providing physicians with acritical yet concise update on the recent advancements made regarding theefficacy of MM as a potential therapeutic option. An update to the literature of 2013 is important given the upcoming changes in legislation on the use ofmarijuana. Also, we briefly highlight the current recommendations provided byCanadian medical colleges on the parameters that need to be considered prior toauthorizing MM use, routes of administration as well as a general overview of theendocannabinoid system as it pertains to cannabis. Lastly, we outline theappropriate medical conditions for which the authorization of MM may present as apractical alternative option in improving patient outcomes as well as individual considerations of which GPs should be mindful. The purpose of this paper is tooffer physicians an educational tool that provides a necessary, evidence-basedanalysis of the therapeutic potential of MM and to ensure physicians are makingdecisions on the therapeutic use of MM in good faith.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Under representation of people with epilepsy and intellectual disability in research.,/pubmed/29927966,"PURPOSE: One quarter of people with epilepsy have an intellectual disability (ID)and one fifth of people with an ID have epilepsy. Both conditions are associated with higher levels of morbidity, stigma and premature mortality. There have been calls for action to promote more research in this group. We examined if thisgroup are represented adequately in current research.METHODS: The proportion of research output in epilepsy conferences andpublications relevant to ID and the proportion in ID conferences and publicationson epilepsy for 2015-2016 were identified. As the percentage of children in thepopulation with epilepsy is 17%, research output of this group was compared with the ID group. Recognised material was classified based on whether it applied togeneral epilepsy/ID research, children with epilepsy or people with epilepsy and ID. Data was analysed to determine the proportion of presented researchspecifically identifying people with epilepsy and ID.RESULTS: Fewer than 2% of presentations at epilepsy conferences specificallyrelated to the ID and epilepsy group compared to 15% relating to children withepilepsy. Similarly only 1.4% of the research presented at major ID conferencesrelated to those with people with epilepsy and ID. About 5% of published researchin the field of epilepsy related to those with ID as compared with 24% forchildren with epilepsy. Twelve percent of published research in ID specificallyidentified epilepsy.CONCLUSION: Publications and conference presentations, on the population withepilepsy and comorbid ID is under-represented. Increased research in this areamight assist in improving the quality of care for this relatively neglectedgroup.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Maternal reproductive performance and fetal development of the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain.,/pubmed/29927665,"Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is an animal model for epilepsy studies, thechronic multifactorial disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Theanimals of this strain are genetically predisposed to sound-induced seizures,called audiogenic seizures, and have been used for many years in studies tounderstand the mechanisms involved in the epilepsies and their neuropsychiatriccomorbidities, as well as the screening of potential anti-convulsant agents.Nevertheless, little is known about the reproductive characteristics of theseanimals. The main goal of this study was to characterize the female reproductive performance and the fetal growth of WARs in comparison to the Wistar rats,obtaining important information for physiology and behavioral studies, as well asfor the preservation of the strain. The results indicated few differences betweenWAR and Wistar regarding the female reproductive performance. There was nosignificant difference in the number of pregnant females by mating, number oflive births per female, number of cells per blastocyst, and severalcharacteristics related to reproductive performance, such as pre- andpost-implantation losses. However, significant differences were observed in birthweight and weight gain until weaning, with WAR animals presenting a body weightbelow Wistar at birth and reduced body weight gain during the lactation period.In addition, the WAR females showed lower body weight on the day 20 of pregnancy and a larger number of corpora lutea, when compared with those of Wistar animals.Thus, we conclude that although Wistar and WAR strains have few differences intheir reproductive performance, which might impact future physiological lifechallenges or others experimentally induced procedures, it still is a very viablestrain regarding reproduction.ABBREVIATIONS: CONCEA: National Council for theControl of Animal Experimentation; GEPR: genetically epilepsy-prone rats; WAR:Wistar Audiogenic Rat.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Incidental diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex by exome sequencing in three families with subclinical findings.,/pubmed/29926239,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disordercharacterized by lesions and benign tumors in multiple organ systems includingthe brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, and lungs. The phenotype is highlyvariable, although penetrance is reportedly complete. We report the moleculardiagnosis of TSC in individuals exhibiting extreme intra-familial variability,including the incidental diagnosis of asymptomatic family members. Exomesequencing was performed in three families, with probands referred for epilepsy, autism, and absent speech (Family 1); epileptic spasms (Family 2); and connectivetissue disorders (Family 3.) Pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2 were identified in nine individuals, including relatives with limited or no medical concerns atthe time of testing. Of the nine individuals reported here, six hadpost-diagnosis examinations and three met clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC.One did not meet clinical criteria for a possible or definite diagnosis of TSC,and two had only a possible clinical diagnosis following post-diagnosis workup.These individuals as well as their mothers demonstrated limited features thatwould not raise concern for TSC in the absence of molecular results. In addition,three individuals exhibited epilepsy with normal brain MRIs, and two withoutseizures or intellectual disability had MRI findings fulfilling major criteriafor TSC highlighting the difficulty providers face when relying on clinicalcriteria to guide genetic testing. Given the importance of a timely TSC diagnosisfor clinical management, such cases demonstrate a potential benefit for clinical criteria to include seizures and an unbiased molecular approach to genetictesting.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Ictal Cardiorespiratory Arrest Associated with Status Epilepticus in Panayiotopoulos Syndrome.,/pubmed/29926008,"A healthy 10-year-old boy vomited during sleep and later complained of abdominal pain; he became drowsy and uncommunicative. At the nearby hospital E.R., hedeteriorated rapidly, and his respiratory movements were absent with cardiacarrest. He was immediately resuscitated. Brain MRI showed no abnormalities. EEGrevealed an abnormal pattern with recurrent multifocal epileptiform activity overthe bilateral occipital and frontal regions during sleep. Based on theclinical/radiological findings we diagnosed Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS), abenign form of early-onset pediatric epilepsy characterized by autonomicsymptoms. Lifethreating cardiopulmonary arrest is rare in PS, but long seizureduration of PS may associate with apnea and bradycardia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system in children in the molecular era.,/pubmed/29925924,"Immune-mediated disorders of the CNS in children are a complex group ofdemyelinating, inflammatory, parainfectious and postinfectious disorders withheterogeneous pathobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations, oftenassociated with fundamental derangement in immune regulation. In this Review, we aim to provide an update on our knowledge of neuroimmune disorders and highlight areas of research that are priorities for improving clinical management. Weoutline the clinical features of neuroimmune disorders, the current approaches totheir treatment and new approaches in development. We then consider thepathological features, including biomarkers, pathological mechanisms andgenetics, and discuss the value of immune assays in clinical investigation andbasic research. On the basis of current knowledge and techniques, we propose fourresearch priorities: rigorous and consistent collection of core clinical data,cooperative investigation of treatments, development of biological assays andgenetic studies. These priorities should help us to achieve the shared goalofÊprecision medicine for neuroimmune disorders. However, multicentre researchand the creation of clinical consortia for these rare disorders will benecessary, and we hope that this Review serves as a call to action that is timelygiven current exciting advances in neuroimmune therapeutics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Suppression of HCN channel function in thalamocortical neurons prevents genetically determined and pharmacologically induced absence seizures.,/pubmed/29925625,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and the Ihcurrent they generate contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of absence seizures (ASs), but their precise role in neocortical and thalamic neuronalpopulations, the main components of the network underlying AS generation remains controversial. In diverse genetic AS models, Ih amplitude is smaller inneocortical neurons and either larger or unchanged in thalamocortical (TC)neurons compared to non-epileptic strains. A lower expression of neocortical HCN subtype 1 channels is present in genetic AS-prone rats and HCN2 Knock-Out miceexhibit ASs. Furthermore, whereas many studies have characterized Ih contributionto ""absence-like"" paroxysmal activityin vitro, no data is available on thespecific role of cortical and thalamic HCN channels in behavioural seizures.Here, we show that the pharmacological block of HCN channels with the antagonist ZD7288 applied via reverse microdialysis in the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) offreely moving male Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg decreases TCneuron firing and abolishes spontaneous ASs. A similar effect is observed on_-hydroxybutyric acid-elicited ASs in normal male Wistar rats. Moreover, thalamicknockdown of HCN channels via virally-delivered shRNA into the VB of maleStargazer mice, another genetic AS model, decreases spontaneous ASs andIh-dependent electrophysiological properties of VB TC neurons. These findingsprovide the first evidence that block of TC neuron HCN channels prevents ASs and suggest that any potential anti-absence therapy that targets HCN channels should carefully consider the opposite role for cortical and thalamic Ih in themodulation of absence seizures.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play critical roles in the fine tuning of cellular and network excitability and have been suggested to be a key element of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying absence seizures. However, theprecise contribution of HCN channels in neocortical and thalamic neuronalpopulations to these non-convulsive seizures is still controversial. In thepresent study, pharmacological block and genetic suppression of HCN channels inthalamocortical neurons in the ventrobasal thalamic nucleus leads to a markedreduction of absence seizures in one pharmacological and two genetic rodentmodels of absence seizures. These results provide the first evidence that blockof TC neuron HCN channels prevents ASs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Outcome after seizure recurrence on antiepileptic drug withdrawal following temporal lobectomy.,/pubmed/29925547,"OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term outcome following seizure recurrence onantiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal after anterior temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.METHODS: We retrospectively studied the AED profile of patients who had a minimumof 5 years of postoperative follow-up after anterior temporal lobectomy formesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Only those patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal MRI were included. AED withdrawal was initiated at 3 months in patients on³2 drugs and at 1 year for patients on a single drug.RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-four patients with median postoperative follow-upof 12 years (range, 7-17 years) were included. Of them, 316 patients (82.3%) wereseizure-free during the terminal 1 year. AED withdrawal was attempted in 326patients (84.9%). At last follow-up, AEDs were discontinued in 207 patients(53.9%). Seizure recurrence occurred in 92 patients (28.2%) on attemptedwithdrawal. After a median postrecurrence follow-up of 7 years, 79 (86%) of them were seizure-free during the terminal 2 years. AEDs could be stopped in 17patients (18.5%) and doses were reduced in another 57 patients (62%). Patientswith febrile seizures, normal postoperative EEG at 1 year, and duration ofepilepsy of <20 years (FND20 score) had 17% risk of seizure recurrence onattempted AED withdrawal. We also formulated a score to predict the chances ofAED freedom for the whole cohort.CONCLUSION: Patients with seizure recurrence on AED withdrawal have good outcome with 86% becoming seizure-free and 18% becoming drug-free after initialrecurrence.

RNAseq analysis of hippocampal microglia after kainic acid-induced seizures.,/pubmed/29925434,"Microglia have been shown to be of critical importance to the progression oftemporal lobe epilepsy. However, the broad transcriptional changes that thesecells undergo following seizure induction is not well understood. As such, weutilized RNAseq analysis upon microglia isolated from the hippocampus todetermine expression pattern alterations following kainic acid induced seizure.We determined that microglia undergo dramatic changes to their expressionpatterns, particularly with regard to mitochondrial activity and metabolism. Wealso observed that microglia initiate immunological activity, specificallyincreasing interferon beta responsiveness. Our results provide novel insightsinto microglia transcriptional regulation following acute seizures and suggestpotential therapeutic targets specifically in microglia for the treatment ofseizures and epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Vitexin reduces epilepsy after hypoxic ischemia in the neonatal brain via inhibition of NKCC1.,/pubmed/29925377,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, characterized by tissue loss and neurologic dysfunction, is a leading cause of mortality and a devastatingdisease of the central nervous system. We have previously shown that vitexin has been attributed various medicinal properties and has been demonstrated to haveneuroprotective roles in neonatal brain injury models. In the present study, wecontinued to reinforce and validate the basic understanding of vitexin (45Êmg/kg)as a potential treatment for epilepsy and explored its possible underlyingmechanisms.METHODS: P7 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that underwent right common carotid arteryligation and rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs) were used for theassessment of Na+-K+-Cl- co-transporter1 (NKCC1) expression, BBB permeability,cytokine expression, and neutrophil infiltration by western blot, q-PCR, flowcytometry (FCM), and immunofluorescence respectively. Furthermore, brainelectrical activity in freely moving rats was recorded by electroencephalography (EEG).RESULTS: Our data showed that NKCC1 expression was attenuated in vitexin-treated rats compared to the expression in the HI group in vivo. Oxygen glucosedeprivation/reoxygenation (OGD) was performed on RBMECs to explore the role ofNKCC1 and F-actin in cytoskeleton formation with confocal microscopy,N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide, and FCM. Concomitantly,treatment with vitexin effectively alleviated OGD-induced NKCC1 expression, whichdownregulated F-actin expression in RBMECs. In addition, vitexin significantlyameliorated BBB leakage and rescued the expression of tight junction-relatedprotein ZO-1. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine and neutrophil infiltration wereconcurrently and progressively downregulated with decreasing BBB permeability in rats. Vitexin also significantly suppressed brain electrical activity in neonatalrats.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results confirmed that vitexin effectivelyalleviates epilepsy susceptibility through inhibition of inflammation along with improved BBB integrity. Our study provides a strong rationale for the furtherdevelopment of vitexin as a promising therapeutic candidate treatment forepilepsy in the immature brain.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Multi-gene panel testing in Korean patients with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.,/pubmed/29924869,"Genetic heterogeneity of common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes isfrequently considered. The present study conducted a focused analysis ofpotential candidate or susceptibility genes for common genetic generalizedepilepsy syndromes using multi-gene panel testing with next-generationsequencing. This study included patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy,juvenile absence epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizuresalone. We identified pathogenic variants according to the American College ofMedical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and identified susceptibility variantsusing case-control association analyses and family analyses for familial cases. Atotal of 57 patients were enrolled, including 51 sporadic cases and 6 familialcases. Twenty-two pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of 16 different geneswere identified. CACNA1H was the most frequently observed single gene. Variantsof voltage-gated Ca2+ channel genes, including CACNA1A, CACNA1G, and CACNA1H wereobserved in 32% of variants (n = 7/22). Analyses to identify susceptibilityvariants using case-control association analysis indicated that KCNMA1 c.400G>Cwas associated with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes. Only 1 family (family A) exhibited a candidate pathogenic variant p.(Arg788His) on CACNA1H, as determined via family analyses. This study identified candidate genetic variants in about a quarter of patients (n = 16/57) and an average of 2.8 variants wasidentified in each patient. The results reinforced the polygenic disorder withvery high locus and allelic heterogeneity of common GGE syndromes. Further,voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are suggested as important contributors to commongenetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.

A mobile clinic approach to the delivery of community-based mental health services in rural Haiti.,/pubmed/29924866,"This study evaluates the use of a mental health mobile clinic to overcome twomajor challenges to the provision of mental healthcare in resource-limitedsettings: the shortage of trained specialists; and the need to improve access to safe, effective, and culturally sound care in community settings. Employingtask-shifting and supervision, mental healthcare was largely delivered bytrained, non-specialist health workers instead of specialists. A retrospectivechart review of 318 unduplicated patients assessed and treated during the mobile clinic's first two years (January 2012 to November 2013) was conducted to exploreoutcomes. These data were supplemented by a quality improvement questionnaire,illustrative case reports, and a qualitative interview with the mobile clinic'slead community health worker. The team evaluated an average of 42 patients perclinic session. The most common mental, neurological, or substance abuse (MNS)disorders were depression and epilepsy. Higher follow-up rates were seen amongthose with diagnoses of bipolar disorder and neurological conditions, while thosewith depression or anxiety had lower follow-up rates. Persons with mood disorderswho were evaluated on at least two separate occasions using a locally developeddepression screening tool experienced a significant reduction in depressivesymptoms. The mental health mobile clinic successfully treated a wide range ofMNS disorders in rural Haiti and provided care to individuals who previously had no consistent access to mental healthcare. Efforts to address these commonbarriers to the provision of mental healthcare in resource-limited settingsshould consider supplementing clinic-based with mobile services.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anticonvulsant effect of dipropofol by enhancing native GABA currents in cortical neurons in mice.,/pubmed/29924712,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common pharmacoresistant focal epilepsydisorder, remains a major unmet medical need. Propofol is used as short-actingmedication for general anesthesia and refractory status epilepticus with issuesof decreased consciousness and memory loss. Dipropofol, a derivative of propofol,has been reported to exert antioxidative and antibacterial activities. Here wereport that dipropofol exerted anticonvulsant activity in mouse model of kainicacid-induced seizures. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of brain slices from themedial entorhinal cortex (mEC) revealed that dipropofol hyperpolarized theresting membrane potential and reduced the number of action potential firings,resulting in suppression of cortical neuronal excitability. Furthermore,dipropofol activated native tonic GABAA currents of mEC layer II stellate neuronsin dose-dependent manner with EC50 value of 9.3 {plus minus} 1.6 _M. Takentogether, our findings showed that dipropofol activated GABAA currents andexerted anticonvulsant activities in mice, thus possessing developmentalpotential for new anticonvulsant therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neuropeptide Y affects thalamic reticular nucleus neuronal firing and network synchronization associated with suppression of spike-wave discharges.,/pubmed/29923603,"OBJECTIVES: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) potently suppresses spike-wave discharges (SWDs)in a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy (GAERS), but the underlyingneurophysiologic mechanisms are not clear. We therefore sought to determine thein vivo effects of NPY on neuronal firing in the cortico-thalamo-cortical networkactivity, known to play a critical role in the generation of SWDs in these rats.METHODS: NPY was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or in separateexperiments locally on the neurons of caudal thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT) by use of juxtacellular iontophoresis in triple-barrel electrodes in male GAERS aged12-15 weeks, in vivo under neuroleptic anesthesia. Drug infusions andelectroencephalography (EEG) monitoring were performed simultaneously withjuxtacellular single neuronal recordings. Effect of NPY on electrically inducedSWD induction threshold were also measured.RESULTS: NPY administration ICV led to a decrease in the total length of SWDs in EEG recordings. Both ICV administration and iontophoresis of NPY on NRT neuronsled to an increase in interictal neuronal firing of NRT neurons. During ictalperiods, ICV NPY administration reduced the number of thalamic action potentials per SWDs, as well as reduced waveform correlations between field potentialswithin the NRT and the cortical EEG. NPY administration ICV did not significantlyalter the firing patterns of relay thalamic neurons interictally and corticalneurons during ictal and interictal periods. In addition, SWD induction thresholdin the S2 region of the cortex was significantly increased after NPYadministration.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show alterations in cortico-thalamo-cortical local and network properties following ICV administration of NPY, suggesting mechanisms of SWD suppression in GAERS. Cellular and network alteration of NRT activity,resulting from a direct action of NPY, may be a contributor to this effect.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Patients' perceptions of and attitudes towards epilepsy surgery: mistaken concepts in Colombia].,/pubmed/29923595,"INTRODUCTION: Selected patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy benefit fromepilepsy surgery, however significant delays remain. The aim of this study was toassess knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy surgery among patients withepilepsy and identify barriers that might delay the treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 10-minute questionnaire was administered to patients withepilepsy in Colombia. Survey assessed the following: knowledge of surgicaloptions, perceptions about the risks of surgery vs. ongoing seizures, diseasedisability, treatment goals, and demographic and socioeconomic variables.RESULTS: We recruited 88 patients with focal epilepsy. More than half of patients(56%) were not aware that surgery might be an option. Apprehension about epilepsysurgery was evident, 60% of patients perceived epilepsy surgery to be very ormoderately dangerous. A large proportion of patients believe death (41%), stroke (47%), vision loss (56%), personality change (56%), paralysis (62%), difficultiesin speaking (69%), and memory loss (60%) were frequent side effects. The majorityof patients (62%) consider the surgical procedure as the last option oftreatment.CONCLUSIONS: There is a negative attitude toward epilepsy surgery based on thepatients' misperceptions of suffering neurological deficits during the surgery,reflecting lack of knowledge toward this type of treatment. These perceptions cancontribute to delays in surgical care.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Requirement of the Mowat-Wilson Syndrome Gene Zeb2 in the Differentiation and Maintenance of Non-photoreceptor Cell Types During Retinal Development.,/pubmed/29922981,"Mutations in the human transcription factor gene ZEB2 cause Mowat-Wilsonsyndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by multiple and variable anomalies including microcephaly, Hirschsprung disease, intellectual disability, epilepsy, microphthalmia, retinal coloboma, and/or optic nerve hypoplasia. Zeb2 in mice is involved in patterning neural and lens epithelia, neural tube closure, as well asin the specification, differentiation and migration of neural crest cells andcortical neurons. At present, it is still unclear how Zeb2 mutations causeretinal coloboma, whether Zeb2 inactivation results in retinal degeneration, and whether Zeb2 is sufficient to promote the differentiation of different retinalcell types. Here, we show that during mouse retinal development, Zeb2 isexpressed transiently in early retinal progenitors and in all non-photoreceptorcell types including bipolar, amacrine, horizontal, ganglion, and Mller glialcells. Its retina-specific ablation causes severe loss of all non-photoreceptorcell types, cell fate switch to photoreceptors by retinal progenitors, andelevated apoptosis, which lead to age-dependent retinal degeneration, optic nervehypoplasia, synaptic connection defects, and impaired ERG (electroretinogram)responses. Moreover, overexpression of Zeb2 is sufficient to promote the fate of all non-photoreceptor cell types at the expense of photoreceptors. Together, our data not only suggest that Zeb2 is both necessary and sufficient for thedifferentiation of non-photoreceptor cell types while simultaneously inhibitingthe photoreceptor cell fate by repressing transcription factor genes involved in photoreceptor specification and differentiation, but also reveal a necessity ofZeb2 in the long-term maintenance of retinal cell types. This work helps todecipher the etiology of retinal atrophy associated with Mowat-Wilson syndromeand hence will impact on clinical diagnosis and management of the patientssuffering from this syndrome.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Prescribing valproate to girls and women of childbearing age in Germany : Analysis of trends based on claims data].,/pubmed/29922910,"BACKGROUND: Measures to raise awareness of the teratogenic potential of valproateand restrict its use in girls/women of childbearing age have been intensified.For Germany, the impact of these measures on valproate prescription rates remainsunknown.OBJECTIVES: Trends in prescribing valproate, the underlying treatment indication,and the specialty of the prescribing physician are analyzed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: With claims data from several statutory health insuranceproviders from 2004 to 2016 (approximately 3.5Êmillion insured persons per year) considering treatment indication and medical specialties of prescribingphysicians, we assessed the rate of girls/women (12 to 50Êyears) with at leastone valproate dispensation per year.RESULTS: The age-standardized rate of girls/women with at least one valproatedispensation declined by 28% between 2004 and 2016 (2.91/1000 vs. 2.09/1000). For2015, the indications were epilepsy (66.9%), bipolar disorder (13.6%),migraine/headache (5.6%), schizoaffective disorder (4.3%), and other mentaldisorders (8.9%). Among epilepsy patients, the proportion treated with valproate declined from 26.2 to 16.8%, but changed little in patients with bipolar disorder(9.3% vs. 8.0%). AÊtotal of 46.3% of valproate dispensations were issued byneurologists or psychiatrists and 29.6% by general practitioners, internalmedicine specialists, or family doctors.CONCLUSIONS: Based on German claims data, aÊdecline of valproate dispensationswas shown for epilepsy patients of childbearing age, while the proportion inother indications has hardly changed since 2004.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Alcohol Use and Alcohol-Related Seizures in Patients With Epilepsy.,/pubmed/29922217,"Purpose: This study aimed to assess alcohol consumption and the occurrence ofalcohol-related seizures in patients with epilepsy within the last 12 months.Methods: In an epilepsy outpatient clinic, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data retrospectively from consecutive adult epilepsy patients who had been suffering from the disease for at least 1 year. Logistic regression analyseswere performed to identify independent predictors. Results: A total of 310patients with epilepsy were included. Of these, 204 subjects (65.8%) consumedalcohol within the last 12 months. Independent predictors for alcohol use wereantiepileptic drug monotherapy (OR 1.901) and physicians' advice that a lightalcohol intake is harmless (OR 4.102). Seizure worsening related to alcoholconsumption was reported by 37 of the 204 patients (18.1%) who had used alcohol. All 37 subjects had consumed large quantities of alcohol prior to the occurrence of alcohol-related seizures regardless of their usual alcohol-drinking behavior. The amount of alcohol intake prior to alcohol-related seizures was at least 7standard drinks, which is equivalent to 1.4 L of beer or 0.7 L of wine. In 95% ofcases, alcohol-related seizures occurred within 12 h after cessation of alcoholintake. Independent predictors for alcohol-related seizures were generalizedgenetic epilepsy (OR 5.792) and chronic heavier alcohol use (OR 8.955).Conclusions: Two-thirds of interviewed subjects had consumed alcohol within thelast 12 months. This finding may be an underestimate due to patients'self-reporting and recall error. In all cases, the occurrence of alcoholrelated-seizures was associated with timely consumption of considerably largeamounts of alcohol. Thus, a responsible alcohol intake seems to be safe for most patients with epilepsy. However, subjects with epilepsy and especially those withgeneralized genetic epilepsy should be made aware of an increased risk forseizures related to heavy alcohol consumption. Factors accompanying acute heavyalcohol intake such as altered sleep architecture, impaired adherence toantiepileptic medication, and metabolic disturbances may further facilitate theoccurrence of seizures.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Tracking the Re-organization of Motor Functions After Disconnective Surgery: A Longitudinal fMRI and DTI Study.,/pubmed/29922216,"Objective: Mechanisms of motor plasticity are critical to maintain motorfunctions after cerebral damage. This study explores the mechanisms of motorreorganization occurring before and after surgery in four patients withdrug-refractory epilepsy candidate to disconnective surgery. Methods: We studied four patients with early damage, who underwent tailored hemispheric surgery inadulthood, removing the cortical motor areas and disconnecting the corticospinal tract (CST) from the affected hemisphere. Motor functions were assessedclinically, with functional MRI (fMRI) tasks of arm and leg movement andDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) before and after surgery with assessments of up to3 years. Quantifications of fMRI motor activations and DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) color maps were performed to assess the lateralization of motor network. We hypothesized that lateralization of motor circuits assessed preoperatively withfMRI and DTI was useful to evaluate the motor outcome in these patients. Results:In two cases preoperative DTI-tractography did not reconstruct the CST, andFA-maps were strongly asymmetric. In the other two cases, the affected CSTappeared reduced compared to the contralateral one, with modest asymmetry in the FA-maps. fMRI showed different degrees of lateralization of the motor network andthe SMA of the intact hemisphere was mostly engaged in all cases. After surgery, patients with a strongly lateralized motor network showed a stable performance.By contrast, a patient with a more bilateral pattern showed worsening of theupper limb function. For all cases, fMRI activations shifted to the intacthemisphere. Structural alterations of motor circuits, observed with FA values,continued beyond 1 year after surgery. Conclusion: In our case series fMRI andDTI could track the longitudinal reorganization of motor functions. In these fourpatients the more the paretic limbs recruited the intact hemisphere in primarymotor and associative areas, the greater the chances were of maintainingelementary motor functions after adult surgery. In particular, DTI-tractographyand quantification of FA-maps were useful to assess the lateralization of motornetwork. In these cases reorganization of motor connectivity continued for longtime periods after surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with arterial spin labeling (ASL) in the differentiation between mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic Acidosis, plus stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS).",/pubmed/29921486,"To compare the utility and limitation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)and arterial spin labeling (ASL) in the differentiation between mitochondrialencephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, plus stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acuteischemic stroke (AIS), a retrospective review of 17 MELAS and 26 AIS patientswere performed. In all patients both MRS and ASL scans were performed within1_week after admission. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and MR imaging datawere reviewed and compared between the two groups. Compared with AIS, MELASpatients had a younger age of onset, a longer disease duration, a higheroccurrence of epilepsy attack, occipital and parietal lesions, and dilatedcerebral arteries (P_<_0.05). In all MELAS patients lactate peak andhyperperfusion of the lesion was revealed. However in AIS lactate peak wasobserved in only 69.2% and hyperperfusion was observed in only 34.6% ischemiclesions (P_<_0.05). Choline/Creatine ratios and Lactate/Creatine ratios werehigher in AIS, while in MELAS cerebral blood flow and lesion-normal perfusionratio was much higher (P_<_0.05). No correlations was found between metaboliteratios and perfusion parameters in either group (P_>_0.05). Area under curve(AUC) of perfusion for the differentiation between MELAS and AIS was 0.958(P_<_0.001). The cut-off value was 2.075, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and aspecificity of 96.2%. AUC of Lactate/Creatine ratio was 0.469 (P_=_0.737).Utility of MRS is limited in the differentiation between MELAS and AIS, while MR perfusion profiles are much more sensitive and specific.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Migraine and associated comorbidities are three times more frequent in children with ADHD and their mothers.,/pubmed/29921473,"OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is aneuro-developmental disorder related to internalizing and externalizing disordersas well as somatic complaints and disorders. This study was conducted to evaluatethe prevalence of headache subtypes, epilepsy, atopic disorders, motion sickness and recurrent abdominal pain among children and adolescents with ADHD and theirparents.METHODS: In a multi-center, cross-sectional, familial association study usingcase-control design, treatment nave children and adolescents between 6 and18_years of age diagnosed with ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria as well asage- and gender-matched healthy controls and their parents were evaluated by aneurologist and analyzed accordingly.RESULTS: 117 children and adolescents with ADHD and 111 controls were included.Headache disorder diagnosis was common for both patients and healthy controls(59.0% vs. 37.8%), with a significantly elevated rate in the ADHD group(p_=_0.002). Migraine was found in 26.0% of ADHD patients and 9.9% of healthycontrols. Tension headache was found in 32.4% of ADHD patients and 27.9% ofhealthy controls. Headache diagnosis was also found to be significantly morecommon in mothers of children with ADHD than control group mothers (90.5% vs.36.6%, p_<_0.001).CONCLUSION: Headache diagnoses and specifically migraines were significantly morecommon among children with ADHD and their mothers, while recurrent abdominal painwas elevated in both parents and ADHD patients. Migraine is an important part of ADHD comorbidity, not only for children but also for mothers. Motion sickness maybe reduced among families of ADHD probands.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"High prevalence of epilepsy in two rural onchocerciasis endemic villages in the Mahenge area, Tanzania, after 20åÊyears of community directed treatment with ivermectin.",/pubmed/29921319,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with a multitude of underlyingcauses, which may include infection with Onchocerca volvulus, the parasitic worm that causes human onchocerciasis. A survey carried out in 1989 revealed a highprevalence of epilepsy (1.02% overall, ranging from 0.51 to 3.71% in tenvillages) in the Mahenge area of Ulanga district, an onchocerciasis endemicregion in south eastern Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the prevalenceand incidence of epilepsy following 20Êyears of onchocerciasis control throughannual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI).METHODS: The study was conducted in January 2017 in two suburban and two ruralvillages in the Mahenge area. Door-to-door household visits were carried out bytrained community health workers and data assistants to screen for personssuspected of having epilepsy, using a standardised questionnaire. Persons withsuspected epilepsy were then interviewed and examined by a neurologist for caseverification. Onchocerciasis associated epilepsy was defined as epilepsy without an obvious cause, with an onset of seizures between the ages of 3-18Êyears inpreviously healthy children. In each village, fifty males aged ³20Êyears weretested for onchocerciasis antibodies using an OV16 rapid test and were examinedfor presence of onchocerciasis nodules. Children aged 6-10Êyears were also testedusing OV16 tests.RESULTS: 5117 individuals (median age 18.5Êyears, 53.2% female) from 1168households were screened. 244 (4.8%) were suspected of having epilepsy andinvited for neurological assessment. Prevalence of epilepsy was 2.5%, with therural villages having the highest rate (3.5% vs 1.5%), PÊ<_0.001. Overallincidence of epilepsy was 111 cases (95% CI: 73-161) per 100_000 person-years,while that of onchocerciasis associated epilepsy was 131 (95% CI: 70-223).Prevalence of OV16 antibodies in adult males and among children 6-10Êyears oldwas higher in rural villages than in suburban villages (76.5% vs 50.6, and 42.6% vs 4.7% respectively), (PÊ<_0.001), while overall prevalence of onchocerciasisnodules was 1.8%.CONCLUSIONS: This survey revealed a high prevalence and incidence of epilepsy in two rural onchocerciasis endemic villages in the Mahenge area. Despite 20Êyearsof CDTI, a high prevalence of OV16 antibodies in children aged 6-10Êyearssuggests on-going O. volvulus transmission. Reasons for the persistence ofon-going parasite transmission in the Mahenge area need to be investigated.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Robotic enucleation for pediatric insulinoma with MEN1 syndrome: a case report and literature review.,/pubmed/29921249,"BACKGROUND: A patient with a rare pediatric insulinoma and MEN1 syndrome wastreated by robotic enucleation surgery.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 9-year-old girl presenting withrepeated loss of consciousness, concomitant with a pale face, palpitations, andconvulsions, which had persisted for 2Êyears and had been aggravated during theprevious 2Êmonths. She was previously misdiagnosed with epilepsy in anotherhospital. We further examined her while she was hospitalized. By combining hermedical history and imaging examination and lab test results, a diagnosis ofinsulinoma was confirmed. Sanger-directed sequencing on a peripheral blood samplerevealed an MEN1 gene mutation, indicating pediatric insulinoma with MEN1syndrome. The patient underwent minimally invasive insulinoma enucleation surgeryunder the Da Vinci robot-assisted system with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS)connected. The surgery was successfully completed within 65Êmin, and the girlrecovered well postoperatively and no longer experienced symptoms ofhypoglycemia.CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a case of pediatric insulinoma treatedusing robotic enucleation. This experience demonstrates the feasibility andsafety of combining robotic surgery with the enucleation procedure as anexcellent strategy for pediatric insulinoma.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Potential application of venom proteins in designing of medicines for treating human neurodegenerative disorders.,/pubmed/29921193,"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorder are persistently increasing andrelentlessly affecting the individuals, families and society as whole.Regrettably these disorders are resistant to the available drugs, the outcomesare only palliative while the side effects of the therapy harm the patientcompliance as well as treatment.

Due to emerging advancement in the field ofproteomics, genomics and molecular biology, characterization and screening ofthese novel compounds become more assessable.CONCLUSION: In this reverence, the present study reviews the currentconsideration of the mode of action and the future prediction concerning the use of novel compounds isolated from arthropods and other venomous animals in thetreatment of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease,Alzheimer disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy and Amyotrophic LateralSclerosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein in POLG-related epilepsy: Diagnostic and prognostic implications.,/pubmed/29920680,"BJECTIVE: Epilepsy is common in individuals with mutations in POLG, the geneencoding the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Earlyrecognition and aggressive seizure management are crucial for patient survival.Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is implicated in various neurologicaldisorders including epilepsy. The aim of this study was to assess whetherPOLG-related disease is associated with BBB dysfunction and what clinicalimplications this has for patients.METHODS: Our retrospective study used data from 83 patients with pathogenic POLG mutations from 4 countries--Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom. Datawere collected using a structured questionnaire. We used the presence of raisedcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and a raised CSF/serum ratio of albumin (Q-alb)to evaluate the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier.RESULTS: Raised CSF protein was found in 70% of patients (n = 58/83) and appearedto be associated with the most severe phenotypes. In those in whom it wasmeasured, the Q-alb ratio was markedly elevated (n = 18). The majority of thosewith epilepsy (n = 50/66, 76%) had raised CSF protein, and this preceded seizure debut in 75% (n = 15/20). The median survival time from symptom onset for thosewith raised CSF protein was decreased (13 months) compared to those with normalCSF protein (32 months).SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that there is disruption of the BBB inPOLG-related disease, as evidenced by a raised CSF protein and Q-alb ratio. Wealso find that raised CSF protein is a common finding in patients with POLGdisease. Our data suggest that the presence of BBB dysfunction predicts a poorer outcome, and elevated CSF protein may therefore be an additional biomarker bothfor early diagnosis and to identify those at high risk of developing epilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Fluorescence in Focal Cortical Dysplasia: Report of 3 Cases.,/pubmed/29920583,"BACKGROUND: Three patients enrolled in a clinical trial of 5-aminolevulinic-acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence-guidance, which has been demonstrated to facilitate intracranial tumor resection, were found on neuropathological examination to havefocal cortical dysplasia (FCD).OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in this case series visible fluorescence and quantitative levels of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) during surgery and correlate these findingswith preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology.METHODS: Patients were administered 5-ALA (20 mg/kg) approximately 3 h prior tosurgery and underwent image-guided, microsurgical resection of their MRI- andelectrophysiologically identified lesions. Intraoperative visible fluorescencewas evaluated using an operating microscope adapted with a commercially availableblue light module. Quantitative PpIX levels were assessed using a handheldfiber-optic probe and a wide-field imaging spectrometer. Sites of fluorescencemeasurements were co-registered with both preoperative MRI and histopathological analysis.RESULTS: Three patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of FCD (Types1b, 2a, and 2b) underwent surgery. All patients demonstrated some degree ofvisible fluorescence (faint or moderate), and all patients had quantitativelyelevated concentrations of PpIX. No evidence of neoplasia was identified onhistopathology, and in 1 patient, the highest concentrations of PpIX were foundat a tissue site with marked gliosis but no typical histological features of FCD.CONCLUSION: FCD has been found to be associated with intraoperative 5-ALA-inducedvisible fluorescence and quantitatively confirmed elevated concentrations of the fluorophore PpIX in 3 patients. This finding suggests that there may be a rolefor fluorescence-guidance during surgical intervention for epilepsy-associatedFCD.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Magnetoencephalography and ictal SPECT in patients with failed epilepsy surgery.,/pubmed/29920428,"OBJECTIVE: Selected patients with intractable focal epilepsy who have failed aprevious epilepsy surgery can become seizure-free with reoperation. Preoperative evaluation is exceedingly challenging in this cohort. We aim to investigate thediagnostic value of two noninvasive approaches, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in patients with failedepilepsy surgery.METHODS: We retrospectively included a consecutive cohort of patients who failed prior resective epilepsy surgery, underwent re-evaluation including MEG and ictalSPECT, and had another surgery after the re-evaluation. The relationship between resection and localization from each test was determined, and their associationwith seizure outcomes was analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were included; 21 (46%) were seizure-free at1-year followup after reoperation. Twenty-seven (58%) had a positive MEG and 31(67%) had a positive ictal SPECT. The resection of MEG foci was significantlyassociated with seizure-free outcome (p_=_0.002). Overlap of ictal SPECThyperperfusion zones with resection was significantly associated withseizure-free outcome in the subgroup of patients with injection time²20_seconds(p_=_0.03), but did not show significant association in the overallcohort (p_=_0.46) although all injections were ictal. Patients whose MEG andictal SPECT were concordant on a sublobar level had a significantly higher chanceof seizure freedom (p_=_0.05).CONCLUSIONS: MEG alone achieved successful localization in patients with failedepilepsy surgery with a statistical significance. Only ictal SPECT with earlyinjection (²20_seconds) had good localization value. Sublobar concordance betweenboth tests was significantly associated with seizure freedom. SPECT can provideessential information in MEG-negative cases and vice versa.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results emphasize the importance of considering a multimodalpresurgical evaluation including MEG and SPECT in all patients with a previousfailed epilepsy surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Patients with epilepsy care experiences: Comparison between services with and without an epilepsy specialist nurse.,/pubmed/29920427,"The aim of this study was to determine whether there were differences inexperiences of care, satisfaction with care and quality of life between those whowere in receipt of care from a service with an epilepsy specialist nurse (ESN)and those who were receiving care from a service that did not include an ESN. Acomparative design was used, which involved the completion of a confidential,self-completed survey. The survey was administered to a nonprobabilityconvenience sample of patients with epilepsy who were attending services with an ESN (n_=_244) and services where the treatment team did not include an ESN(n_=_261) from each of the four health areas in Ireland. This study found that,in comparison to people with epilepsy (PWE) who attended a service without anESN, PWE who attended a service with an ESN reported receiving greater amount of information, were more involved in their care, perceived care to be bettercoordinated, and had greater confidence in the information provided and greatercomfort in discussing issues with an ESN. They also reported higher rates ofsatisfaction with the emotional and practical support offered. Thus, it may beconcluded that models of care involving the input of ESNs enhance the quality of epilepsy care and care processes. The findings also emphasize the need to have anESN as part of the multidisciplinary team.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Curcumin in epilepsy disorders.,/pubmed/29917276,"Curcumin, a principal curcuminoid present in turmeric, has an antioxidant,anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Preclinical studies haveindicated its beneficial effect for the treatment of epilepsy disorders. Themolecule has an anti-seizure potential in preclinical studies, including chemicaland electrical models of acute and chronic epilepsy. Curcumin also possesses ananti-epileptogenic activity as it reduces spontaneous recurrent seizures severityin a kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The antioxidant andanti-inflammatory nature of curcumin might be responsible for its observedanti-seizure effects; nevertheless, the exact mechanism is not yet clear. Thepoor availability of curcumin to the brain limits its use in clinics. Theapplication of nanoliposome and liposome technologies has been tested to enhance its brain availability and penetrability. Unfortunately, there are no randomized,double-blinded controlled clinical trials validating the use of curcumin inepilepsy. The present article analyzes different preclinical evidenceillustrating the effect of curcumin in seizure models. The review encouragescarrying out clinical trials in this important area of research. In conclusion,curcumin might be beneficial in patients with epilepsy disorders, if itsbioavailability issues are resolved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Health care expenditures among elderly patients with epilepsy in the United States.,/pubmed/29917230,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health care expendituresamong elderly patients with epilepsy in the United States.METHODS: We performed an analysis of weighted 37 738 607 US participants aged 65 years to estimate health care expenditures in the elderly with and withoutepilepsy using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component, with2003-2014 data. Unadjusted health care expenditures were estimated. Independenthealth care expenditures were estimated, using a 2-part model.RESULTS: We identified 416 496 (1.1%) older individuals with epilepsy.Comorbidities were more prevalent among older individuals with epilepsy versusyounger individuals. Mean unadjusted yearly medical cost of epilepsy in elderlypatients with epilepsy was $18 712 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $15 947-$21476) during the pooled period 2003-2014, which was nearly double the equivalentcost in elderly subjects without epilepsy at $10 168 (95% CI = $9925-$10 410).Mean unadjusted annual medical cost of epilepsy in the elderly increased by $2135from $15 850 (95% CI = $10 668-$21 032) in 2003-2006 to $17 985 (95% CI = $13710-$22 260) in 2011-2014. Adjusted mean total health care expenditures perperson per year for elderly patients with epilepsy were $12 526 in 2003-2006, $13423 in 2007-2010, and $10 569 in 2011-2014. Adjusted incremental health carecosts associated with epilepsy in the elderly accrued by $4595 (95% CI =$2399-$6791) when compared to elderly subjects without epilepsy. We estimated themean annual aggregate cost of epilepsy at $7.8 billion to the US population.SIGNIFICANCE: Epilepsy is common among elderly individuals, and health careexpenditures among this growing group are 2 times higher than in those withoutepilepsy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Psychological treatments for adults and children with epilepsy: Evidence-based recommendations by the International League Against Epilepsy Psychology Task Force.,/pubmed/29917225,"Given the significant impact that psychosocial factors and epilepsy treatmentscan have on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of individuals withepilepsy and their families, there is great clinical interest in the role ofpsychological evaluation and treatments to improve HRQOL and comorbidities.Therefore, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) charged thePsychology Task Force with the development of recommendations for clinical carebased on evaluation of the evidence from their recent Cochrane review ofpsychological treatments in individuals with epilepsy. The literature search for a recent Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials investigatingpsychological treatments for individuals with epilepsy constitutes the key sourceof evidence for this article. To provide practical guidance to service providers,we provide ratings on study research designs based on (1) the American Academy ofNeurology's Level of Evidence system and (2) the Grading of Recommendations,Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. This paper is the culmination of an international collaboration process involving pediatric and adultpsychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychiatrists. The processand conclusions were reviewed and approved by the ILAE Executive Committee. Thestrongest evidence for psychological interventions was identified for the mostcommon mental health problems, including depression, neurocognitive disturbances,and medication adherence. Psychological interventions targeting the enhancementof HRQOL and adherence and a decrease in comorbidity symptoms (anxiety,depression) should be incorporated into comprehensive epilepsy care. There is arange of psychological strategies (ie, cognitive behavioral therapy andmindfulness-based therapies) that show promise for improving the lives of personswith epilepsy, and clinical recommendations are provided to assist epilepsyhealth care providers in treating the comorbidities and challenges associatedwith epilepsy and its treatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MiR-134 expression and changes in inflammatory cytokines of rats with epileptic seizures.,/pubmed/29917202,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of miR-134 and the change ofinflammatory cytokines in seizure rats and to explore its relationship.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of seizures was made by an intraperitonealinjection with kainic acid. ELISA kit for detection of seizures in rats was used.The changes of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-_, IFN-_) and thehippocampal neuronal cell growth were observed. The expression of miR-134 inbrain tissue and serum samples of model group and control group was determined byreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantitativedetermination.RESULTS: After the intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid, the rat model ofseizure was successfully established. Compared with the control group, theneuronal cells in the hippocampus of the model group showed evident pathological changes. Inflammatory cytokines in seizures rats showed that the increase ofIL-2, IL-6, and TNF-_ were larger, but the increase of IL-1 and IFN-_ was notobvious. The results of the RT-PCR quantitative analysis showed that theexpression of miR-134 in brain tissue and serum of epilepsy rats was lower thanthat of the control group (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-134 would be down by the increasing ofinflammatory cytokines in the epileptic seizure.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Detection of Lesions in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy by Using MR Fingerprinting.,/pubmed/29916782,"Purpose To improve diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in patients withmesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) by using MR fingerprinting and compare with visual assessment of T1- and T2-weighted MR images. Materials and Methods Forthis prospective study performed between April and November 2016, T1 and T2 maps were obtained and tissue segmentation performed in consecutive patients withdrug-resistant MTLE with unilateral or bilateral HS. T1 and T2 maps were comparedbetween 33 patients with MTLE (23 women and 10 men; mean age, 32.6 years; agerange, 16-60 years) and 30 healthy participants (20 women and 10 men; mean age,28.8 years; age range, 18-40 years). Differences in individual bilateralhippocampi were compared by using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, whereas theWilcoxon rank-sum test was used for difference analysis between healthy controlparticipants and patients with MTLE. Results The diagnosis rate (ie, ratio of HS diagnosed on the basis of a 2.5-minute MR fingerprinting examination comparedwith standard methods: MRI, electroencephalography, and PET) was 32 of 33 (96.9%;95% confidence interval: 84.9%, 100%), reflecting improved accuracy of diagnosis (P = 1.92 _ 10-12) over routine MR examinations that had a diagnostic rate of 23 of 33 (69.7%; 95% confidence interval: 51.5%, 81.6%). The comparison betweenatrophic and normal-appearing hippocampus in 33 patients with MTLE and healthycontrol participants demonstrated that both T1 and T2 values in HS lesions werehigher than those of normal hippocampal tissue of healthy participants (T1: 1361 msec ± 85 vs 1249 msec ± 59, respectively; T2: 135 msec ± 15 vs 104 msec ± 9,respectively; P < .0001). Conclusion MR fingerprinting allowed formultiparametric mapping of temporal lobe within 2.5 minutes and helped toidentify lesions suspicious for HS in patients with MTLE with improved accuracy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation of subdural electrode displacement in invasive epilepsy surgery workup using neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI.,/pubmed/29916770,"OBJECTIVES: One of the main obstacles of electrode implantation in epilepsysurgery is the electrode shift between implantation and the day of explantation. We evaluated this possible electrode displacement using intraoperative MRI(iopMRI) data and CT/MRI reconstruction.METHODS: Thirteen patients (nine female, four male, median age 26Ê±Ê9.4Êyears)suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy were examined. After implantation, theposition of subdural electrodes was evaluated by 3.0ÊT-MRI and thin-slice CCT for3D reconstruction. Localization of electrodes was performed with thevolume-rendering technique. Post-implantation and pre-explantation 1.5 T-iopMRIscans were coregistered with the 3D reconstructions to determine the extent ofelectrode dislocation.RESULTS: Intraoperative MRI at the time of explantation revealed a relevantelectrode shift in one patient (8%) of 10Êmm. Median electrode displacement was1.7Ê±Ê2.6Êmm with a coregistration error of 1.9Ê±Ê0.7Êmm. The median accuracy of the neuronavigation system was 2.2Ê±Ê0.9Êmm. Six of twelve patients undergoingresective surgery were seizure free (Engel class 1A, median follow-up37.5Ê±Ê11.8Êmonths).CONCLUSION: Comparison of pre-explantation and post-implantation iopMRI scanswith CT/MRI data using the volume-rendering technique resulted in an accurateplacement of electrodes. In one patient with a considerable electrodedislocation, the surgical approach and extent was changed due to the detectedelectrode shift.ABBREVIATIONS: ECoG: electrocorticography; EZ: epileptogenic zone; iEEG: invasiveEEG; iopMRI: intraoperative MRI; MEG: magnetoencephalography; PET: positronemission tomography; SPECT: single photon emission computed tomography; 3D:three-dimensional.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in Iceland.,/pubmed/29940573,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we examined multiple sclerosis (MS) point prevalencein the well-defined island population of Iceland.METHODS: This study included all registered residents of Iceland with MS on theprevalence day, December 31, 2007. All included patients met at least one of the following criteria: McDonald criteria; Poser criteria for clinically definite MS,laboratory-supported definite MS, clinically probable MS; or criteria for primaryprogressive MS. The patients' medical records were reviewed, including allavailable MRI data acquired prior to the prevalence day.RESULTS: We identified 526 patients, of whom 73% (382) were women. The crudepoint prevalence of MS was 167.1 per 100,000 population on the prevalence day.With age adjustment made to the 2000 U.S. population, the prevalence was 166.5per 100,000 population. The mean patient age on the prevalence day was 47years(range 13-89) for both men and women. The mean age at diagnosis was 36 years(range 13-77): 35 years for women and 36 years for men.CONCLUSION: MS prevalence was high in Iceland compared to the prevalencementioned in reports from most of the world, and was similar to prevalence rates in other Nordic countries.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term exposure to air pollution and the incidence of multiple sclerosis: A population-based cohort study.,/pubmed/29940476,"BACKGROUND: Evidence of the adverse neurological effects of exposure to ambientair pollution is emerging, but little is known about its effect on thedevelopment of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common autoimmune disease of thecentral nervous system.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations between MS incidence and long-termexposures to fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study to investigate theassociations between long-term exposures to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 and the incidence of MS. Our study population included all Canadian-born residents aged 20-40 yearswho lived in the province of Ontario, Canada from 2001 to 2013. Incident MS wasascertained from a validated registry. We assigned estimates of annualconcentrations of these pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjectsfor each year during the 13 years of follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pollutant separately usingrandom-effects Cox proportional hazards models. We conducted various sensitivity analyses, such as lagging exposure up to 5 years and adjusting for access toneurological care, annual average temperature, and population density.RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2013, we identified 6203 incident cases of MS. Theadjusted HR of incident MS was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86-1.07) for PM2.5, 0.91(95% CI:0.81-1.02) for NO2, and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.98-1.23) for O3. These results wererobust to various sensitivity analyses conducted.CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort, we did not observesignificant associations between MS incidence and long-term exposures to PM2.5,NO2, and O3 in adults in Ontario, 2001-2013.",N,,,,,,,,,,
ë±-Methyl-ë±-phenylsuccinimide ameliorates neurodegeneration in a C. elegans model of TDP-43 proteinopathy.,/pubmed/29940336,"The antiepileptic drug ethosuximide has recently been shown to be neuroprotectivein various Caenorhabditis elegans and rodent neurodegeneration models. It istherefore a promising repurposing candidate for the treatment of multipleneurodegenerative diseases. However, high concentrations of the drug are requiredfor its protective effects in animal models, which may impact on itstranslational potential and impede the identification of its molecular mechanism of action. Therefore, we set out to develop more potent neuroprotective leadcompounds based on ethosuximide as a starting scaffold. Chemoinformaticapproaches were used to identify compounds with structural similarity toethosuximide and to prioritise these based on good predicated blood-brain barrierpermeability and C. elegans bioaccumulation properties. Selected compounds wereinitially screened for anti-convulsant activity in a C. eleganspentylenetetrazol-induced seizure assay, as a rapid primary readout ofbioactivity; and then assessed for neuroprotective properties in a C. elegansTDP-43 proteinopathy model based on pan-neuronal expression of human A315T mutantTDP-43. The most potent compound screened, _-methyl-_-phenylsuccinimide (MPS),ameliorated the locomotion defects and extended the shortened lifespan of TDP-43 mutant worms. MPS also directly protected against neurodegeneration by reducingthe number of neuronal breaks and cell body losses in GFP-labelled GABAergicmotor neurons. Importantly, optimal neuroprotection was exhibited by externalapplication of 50__M MPS, compared to 8_mM for ethosuximide. This greater potencyof MPS was not due to bioaccumulation to higher internal levels within the worm, based on 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Like ethosuximide, the activity of MPS was abolished by mutation of the evolutionarily conserved FOXOtranscription factor, daf-16, suggesting that both compounds act via the sameneuroprotective pathway(s). In conclusion, we have revealed a novelneuroprotective activity of MPS that is >100-fold more potent than ethosuximide. This increased potency will facilitate future biochemical studies to identify thedirect molecular target(s) of both compounds, as we have shown here that theyshare a common downstream DAF-16-dependent mechanism of action. Furthermore, MPS is the active metabolite of another approved antiepileptic drug, methsuximide.Therefore, methsuximide may have repurposing potential for treatment of TDP-43proteinopathies and possibly other human neurodegenerative diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Quantification characteristics of digital spiral analysis for understanding the relationship among tremor and clinical measures in persons with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29940199,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative neurological conditioncausing demyelination and neuronal loss. Tremor, a symptom of MS, is prevalent in45.0-46.8% NARCOMS registrants. Although several tools to measure tremor exist,few outcomes are quantitative or regularly utilized clinically.NEW METHOD: Introduction of a novel adaptation of the digital spiral drawing tofind a quick, sensitive, and clinically useful technique, to predict tremor inpersons with MS (pwMS). Digital spiral measures included: Segment Rate (SEGRT),Standard Deviation (SD) of Radial Velocity (VSD-R), SD of Tangential Velocity(VSD-T), SD of Overall Velocity (VSD-O), Mean Drawing Velocity (MNV-O) and MeanPen Pressure Acceleration (MNA-P). Digital spiral measures were compared with themanual Archimedes Spiral (AS) drawing and the following clinical measures:Finger-Nose Test (FNT), presence of visually observed intention tremor (VOT),Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT), and Box and Block Test (BBT).RESULTS: All clinical measures utilized demonstrated significant relationshipswith all digital variables, except VSD-R. The forward-stepwise regressionrevealed BBT accounted for the most variance, followed by SEGRT. Comparison with Existing Methods: SEGRT is more sensitive in detecting VOT and better forquantifying tremor than AS. BBT and SEGRT are optimal predictive measures fortremor.CONCLUSIONS: SEGRT has stronger sensitivity and negative predictive value than ASin detecting VOT. All clinical measures (NHPT, FNT, BBT, and AS) weresignificantly associated with the digital variables (SEGRT, VSD-T, VSD-O, MNV-O, and MNA-P) except for VSD-R. After controlling for Patient Determined DiseaseSteps (PDDS), BBT and SEGRT are the best predictive measures for tremor.",N,,,,,,,,,,
SHANK3 variant as a cause of nonsyndromal autism in an 11-year-old boy and a review of published literature.,/pubmed/29939863,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a spectrum of pervasiveneuropsychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction,communication, unusual and repetitive behaviours. The aetiology of ASD isbelieved to involve complex interactions between genetic and environmentalfactors; it can be further classified as syndromic or nonsyndromic, according to whether it is the primary diagnosis or secondary to an existing condition whereboth common and rare genetic variants contribute to the development of ASD or areclearly causal. The prevalence of ASD in children is increasing with higher ratesof diagnosis and an estimated one in 100 affected in the UK. Given thatheritability is a major contributing factor, we aim to discuss research findings to-date in the context of a high-risk autism candidate gene, SHANK3 (SH3 andmultiple ankyrin repeat domain 3), with its loss resulting in synaptic functiondisruption. We present a 10-year-old patient with a pathogenic de novoheterozygous c.1231delC, p.Arg411Val frameshift variant in SHANK3. He presentedwith severe autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and pathologicaldemand avoidance, on a background of developmental impairment and languageregression. The number of genes associated with autism is ever increasing. It is a heterogeneous group of disorders with no single gene conferring pathogenesis inthe majority of cases. Genetic abnormalities can be detected in ~15% of ASD andthese range from copy number variants in 16p11.2 and 15q13.2q13.3 to severalwell-known genetic disorders including tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome.Further, high confidence autism genes include but are not limited to NRXN, NLGN3,NLGN4, SHANK2 and SHANK3.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Placement of selected new FDA-approved drugs in Medicare Part D formularies, 2009-2013.",/pubmed/29939507,"OBJECTIVES: To assess formulary decisions by Part D plans for selected newlyapproved drugs.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.METHODS: Formulary placement and restrictions were identified for 33 drugs in 8therapeutic classes (antihyperglycemics, anticoagulants, antiplatelets,disease-modifying agents for multiple sclerosis [MS] and rheumatoid arthritis[RA], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] drugs, antiepileptics, andantipsychotics) in 863 Part D plans with continuous CMS contracts between 2009and 2013. Multivariable models estimated the impact of drug characteristics andPart D plan characteristics on probability of drug adoption and, for adopters,evaluated factors associated with months to adoption and requirements for priorauthorization (PA) or step therapy (ST).RESULTS: First Part D formulary placements varied from 2 to 14 months post FDAapproval. On average, 56.7% of plans placed each drug within 6 months and 64.1%placed within 1Êyear of the National Drug Code assignment date. The most rapidadoption was for antipsychotics and antiepileptics. TheÊslowest was for COPDdrugs. More than 90% of disease-modifying agents for MS and RA were subject toPA. ST was uncommon except for antihyperglycemic agents. In adjusted analyses,enhanced benefit plans had a 4% higher probability of formulary placement (P<.01), and each additional star in the CMS star rating system increased theprobability of adoption by 4% (P <.01). Overall, Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans had higher placement rates due to greater reliance on enhanced planofferings and higher star ratings.CONCLUSIONS: We found significant heterogeneity in formulary placement andrestrictions for 33 new drugs in the Part D marketplace between 2009 and 2013.Further research is necessary to determine whether this pattern applies to other drug classes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cognition in older patients with multiple sclerosis compared to patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy older adults.,/pubmed/29939057,"OBJECTIVE: Progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has resulted inlarger numbers of patients living to an advanced age, but little is known aboutthe cognitive status of these individuals. The primary purpose of this study was to identify differences in the cognitive performance between elderly individuals with MS and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).METHOD: Three groups ranging in age from 60 to 80 were compared: patients with MS(n = 64), patients with aMCI (n = 58), and healthy adults (n = 70). Allparticipants completed a standard neuropsychological test battery that evaluated domains of attention, processing speed, executive function, memory, language, andvisual spatial function.RESULTS: Compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls, elderly MSpatients exhibited a pattern of cognitive impairment centering on informationprocessing speed and memory that was consistent with the deficits observed inother studies of MS patients regardless of age. Compared to aMCI patients, the MSpatients exhibited worse performance on measures of processing speed, but better performance on a measure of memory under cued conditions (Selective RemindingTest), a nonspeeded measure of language (Boston Naming Test), and measures ofexecutive function with processing speed statistically controlled (Trail MakingTest, Stroop Test).CONCLUSIONS: Differences on neuropsychological measures can serve to distinguish aMCI from MS-related cognitive impairment in older patients, but it is essential that these measures control for the deficit in processing speed that is such aprimary feature of MS.

The effect of fingolimod on focal and diffuse grey matter damage in active MS patients.,/pubmed/29938336,"INTRODUCTION: The mechanism of action of fingolimod within the central nervoussystem and its efficacy in reducing/preventing both focal and diffuse grey matter(GM) damage in active multiple sclerosis (MS) are not completely understood.METHODS: In this longitudinal, 2-year prospective, phase IV, single-blind study, 40 MS patients treated with fingolimod and 39 untreated age, gender, anddisability-matched MS patients were enrolled. Each patient underwent aneurological examination every 6Êmonths and a 3T MRI at the beginning of thetreatment and after 24Êmonths. The accumulation of new cortical lesions (CLs) andthe progression of regional GM atrophy were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: At the end of the study (T24), the percentage of patients with new CLs(13.5 vs. 89%, p_<_0.001) and the percentage of GM volume change was lower in thetreated group (p_<_0.001). The regional analysis revealed that the treated group had also less volume loss in thalamus, caudatus, globus pallidus, cingulatecortex, and hippocampus (p_<_0.001), as well as in, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, and insular-long gyrus (p_<_0.05). Patients with no evidence of diseaseactivity were 60% in the treated group and 10% in the untreated group(p_<_0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a possible protective effect of fingolimod on focal and diffuse GM damage.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Multiple Sclerosis in the Asia Pacific Region: A Systematic Review of a Neglected Neurological Disease.,/pubmed/29937752,"Background: Multiple sclerosis is thought to be relatively uncommon in the AsiaPacific region with prevalence estimated between 0 and 20 per 100,000. There isreason to doubt these estimates due to the lack of data from many countries andthe growing evidence of variability in prevalence across small geographic areas. This study was conducted to systematically review the population prevalence,incidence, mortality and disability progression estimates of MS within the AsiaPacific region. Methods: The systematic review was conducted on articles from1985 till 31st July 2017 within the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and TheCochrane Library databases. The review included articles that werepopulation-based studies conducted on patients with MS in the Asia Pacific regionthat reported either incidence, prevalence, mortality, or disease progression.Hospital-based studies and non-research articles were excluded to ensure thatonly information representative of the population was included for analysis. Dataappraisal and extraction was done by independent reviewers. This review wasregistered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42017082760). Findings: Of the 2,757 articlesfound, 16 studies were included. Information on 6 (18.75%) of 32 Asia Pacificcountries was found, with data representing 8% of the total population.Prevalence estimates were available for 6 countries while estimates for incidence(3 countries), mortality (4 countries), and disease progression (2 countries)were limited. Interpretation: The lack of epidemiological data available in theAsia Pacific region creates a blind spot in the surveillance of MS which obscuresthe true burden of MS, causing patients to struggle to receive the resources and funding that they need.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Onset Symptoms, Tobacco Smoking, and Progressive-Onset Phenotype Are Associated With a Delayed Onset of Multiple Sclerosis, and Marijuana Use With an Earlier Onset.",/pubmed/29937751,"Background: Age at symptom onset (ASO) is a prognostic factor that could affectthe accrual of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Some factors areknown to influence the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), but their influence onthe ASO is less well-investigated. Objective: Examine the associations betweenknown or emerging MS risk factors and ASO. Methods: This was a multicenter study,incident cases (n = 279) with first clinical diagnosis of demyelinating eventaged 18-59 years recruited at four Australian centres (latitudes 27¡-43¡S), from 1 November 2003 to 31 December 2006. Environmental/behavioral variables andinitial symptoms were recorded at baseline interview. Linear regression was used to assess the association between risk factors and ASO. Results: Five factorswere significantly associated with ASO: a history of tobacco smoking wasassociated with 3.05-years later ASO (p = 0.002); a history of marijuana use was associated with 6.03-years earlier ASO (p < 0.001); progressive-onset cases had5.61-years later ASO (p = 0.001); an initial presentation of bowel & bladder and cerebral dysfunctional were associated with 3.39 (p = 0.017) and 4.37-years (p = 0.006) later ASO, respectively. Other factors, including sex, offspring number,latitude of study site, history of infectious mononucleosis, HLA-DR15 & HLA-A2genotype, 25(OH)D levels, and ultraviolet radiation exposure were not associated with ASO. Including all five significant variables into one model explained 12%of the total variance in ASO. Conclusion: We found a novel association between a history of tobacco smoking and later onset, whereas marijuana use was associated with earlier onset. Behavioral factors seem important drivers of MS onset timing although much of the variance remains unexplained.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cortical Excitability and Interhemispheric Connectivity in Early Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Studied With TMS-EEG.,/pubmed/29937712,"Evoked potentials (EPs) are well established in clinical practice for diagnosisand prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, their value is limited to the assessment of their respective functional systems. Here, we used transcranialmagnetic stimulation (TMS) coupled with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) toinvestigate cortical excitability and spatiotemporal dynamics of TMS-evokedneural activity in MS patients. Thirteen patients with early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0 (range0-2.5) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received single-pulse TMS of left and right primary motor cortex (L-M1 and R-M1), respectively. Restingmotor threshold for L-M1 and R-M1 was increased in MS patients. Latencies andamplitudes of N45, P70, N100, P180, and N280 TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs)were not different between groups, except a significantly increased amplitude of the N280 TEP in the MS group, both for L-M1 and R-M1 stimulation.Interhemispheric signal propagation (ISP), estimated from the area under thecurve of TEPs in the non-stimulated vs. stimulated M1, also did not differbetween groups. In summary, findings show that ISP and TEPs were preserved inearly-stage RRMS, except for an exaggerated N280 amplitude. Our findings indicatethat TMS-EEG is feasible in testing excitability and connectivity in corticalneural networks in MS patients, complementary to conventional EPs. However,relevance and pathophysiological correlates of the enhanced N280 will needfurther study.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prospective memory in clinical populations.,/pubmed/29936902,"OBJECTIVE: Prospective memory (PM) has emerged as a form of episodic memory that is frequently impaired in a variety of clinical populations. Neuropsychologistswho routinely evaluate these populations are often unaware of the possibility of PM deficits or the impact these deficits may have on everyday functioning. Theobjective of this special issue is to provide an overview of the nature ofprospective deficits in a range of clinical populations, to discussneuropsychological assessment techniques, and to critically evaluate managementstrategies.METHOD: We solicited papers from established researchers and issued a generalcall for papers for the special issue on PM in clinical populations.RESULTS: We received submissions from the nine authors that we solicited. Thesesubmissions range from developmental disorders, including autism, attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia; to disorders of adulthood, such as schizophrenia, HIV, brain injury, and multiple sclerosis; and finally disordersthat tend to occur at older ages, such as Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment. In addition, we have included four original research articles thatprovide novel data on other populations. These are children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia,individuals with mild brain injury, and individuals with idiopathic REM sleepbehavioral disorder.CONCLUSIONS: The issue highlights the need for clinical neuropsychologists to be aware of the possible existence of deficits in PM in a variety of clinicalpopulations and the importance of both assessment and management strategies toreduce the impact on daily life.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High intensity interval training for people with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.,/pubmed/29936326,"BACKGROUND: Aerobic high intensity interval training (HIIT) is safe in thegeneral population and more efficient in improving fitness than continuousmoderate intensity training. The body of literature examining HIIT in multiplesclerosis (MS) is expanding but to date a systematic review has not beenconducted. The aim of this review was to investigate the efficacy and safety ofHIIT in people with MS.METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in September 2017 in EMBASE,MEDline, PEDro, CENTRAL and Web of Science Core collections using appropriatekeywords and MeSH descriptors. Reference lists of relevant articles were alsosearched. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were published in English,used HIIT, and included participants with MS. Quality was assessed using thePEDro scale. The following data were extracted using a standardised form: studydesign and characteristics, outcome measures, significant results, drop-outs, andadverse events.RESULTS: Seven studies (described by 11 articles) were identified: fourrandomised controlled trials, one randomised cross-over trial and two cohortstudies. PEDro scores ranged from 3 to 8. Included participants (n_=_249) werepredominantly mildly disabled; one study included only people with progressiveMS. Six studies used cycle ergometry and one used arm ergometry to deliver HIIT. One study reported six adverse events, four which could be attributed to theintervention. The other six reported that there were no adverse events. Sixstudies reported improvements in at least one outcome measure, however there were60 different outcome measures in the seven studies. The most commonly measureddomain was fitness, which improved in five of the six studies measuring aspectsof fitness. The only trial not to report positive results included people withprogressive and a more severe level of disability (Extended Disability StatusScale 6.0-8.0).CONCLUSION: HIIT appears to be safe and effective in increasing fitness in peoplewith MS and low levels of disability. Further research is required to explore theeffectiveness of HIIT in people with progressive MS and in those with higherlevels of disability.",N,,,,,,,,,,
2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria: A review of the evidence.,/pubmed/29936325,"The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has continuously evolved, allowing foran earlier and more accurate diagnosis of MS over time. The McDonald Criteria fordiagnosis of MS were originally proposed in 2001, with previous revisions in both2005 and 2010. The International Panel on Diagnosis in MS have recently reviewed the 2010 McDonald Criteria, and made recommendations for the revised 2017McDonald Criteria. Any revisions made relied entirely on the available evidence, and not expert opinion. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent 2017revisions to the McDonald Criteria, focusing in particular on the motivatingevidence behind the recommendations made. We also review the existing researcharound misdiagnosis in MS, as well as areas considered to be high priorities ofresearch, currently lacking in sufficient evidence, which may influence futurediagnostic criteria in years to come. Finally, we illustrate some clinicalexamples, to demonstrate the impact of new diagnostic criteria on time to MSdiagnosis in a real-world setting.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Modulation in miR-200a/SIRT1axis is associated with apoptosis in MPP(+)-induced SH-SY5Y cells.,/pubmed/29936262,"Previous studies have shown that miR-200a is markedly deregulated in variousneurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), MultipleSclerosis (MS) and PD. Furthermore, studies have shown the key role of miR-200aon expression of SIRT1 and apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized thatmiR-200a/SIRT1 axis should have a crucial role in apoptosis of DA neurons. Inthis study, human SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP+ and expression ofmiR-200a, SIRT1 and its target genes were assessed. Our results confirmed thatexpression of miR-200a significantly up-regulated during treating of humanSH-SY5Y cells with MPP+ in order to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis.Additionally, transcript level of SIRT1 in these cells showed significantdown-regulation confirming that SIRT1 is indeed decreased due to miR-200aup-regulation during apoptosis. Moreover, expression of P53, FOXO1 and BCL2 were modulated. In this study, we indicated that miR-200a/SIRT1 axis directlycorrelates with apoptosis and P53 signaling pathway. In conclusion, miR-200a and its target gene, SIRT1, may exert a possible role in induction of apoptosis in DAneurons through regulating P53, apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathways.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The forgotten effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone: metabolic functions and medical applications.,/pubmed/29935915,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) causes a variety of thyroidal andnon-thyroidal effects, the best known being the feedback regulation of thyroidhormone levels. This was employed in the TRH stimulation test, which is currentlylittle used. The role of TRH as a cancer biomarker is minor, but exaggeratedresponses to TSH and prolactin levels in breast cancer led to the hypothesis of apotential role for TRH in the pathogenesis of this disease. TRH is a rapidlydegraded peptide with multiple targets, limiting its suitability as a biomarkerand drug candidate. Although some studies reported efficacy in neural diseases(depression, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.),therapeutic use of TRH is presently restricted to spinocerebellar degenerativedisease. Regulation of TRH production in the hypothalamus, patterns of expressionof TRH and its receptor in the body, its role in energy metabolism and inprolactin secretion are addressed in this review.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor superfamily of cytokines in the pathogenesis of preclinical and human multiple sclerosis: In silico and in vivo evidences.,/pubmed/29935880,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine with pleiotropicactions involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

We show anupregulation of the receptors involved in MIF signaling both in the animal model and in patients. Also, a significant increase in MIF receptors is found in theCNS lesions associated to MS. Finally, the specific inhibitor of MIF, ISO-1,improved both ex vivo and in vivo the features of EAE. Overall, our data indicatethat there is a significant involvement of the MIF pathway in MSethiopathogenesis and that interventions specifically blocking MIF receptors may represent useful therapeutic approaches in the clinical setting.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Since TLE shares distinct pathogeneticaspects with multiple sclerosis (MS), we have here scrutinized therapeuticeffects in experimental TLE of the immunmodulator fingolimod, which isestablished in MS therapy. Fingolimod targets sphingosine-phosphate receptors(S1PRs). mRNAs of fingolimod target S1PRs were augmented in two experimental poststatus epilepticus (SE) TLE mouse models (suprahippocampal kainate/pilocarpine). SE frequently induces chronic recurrent seizures after an extended latencyreferred to as epileptogenesis. Transient fingolimod treatment of mice duringepileptogenesis after suprahippocampal kainate-induced SE revealed substantialreduction of chronic seizure activity despite lacking acute attenuation of SEitself. Intriguingly, fingolimod exerted robust anti-convulsive activity inkainate-induced SE mice treated in the chronic TLE stage and had neuroprotective and anti-gliotic effects and reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltrates. Finally, theexpression profile of fingolimod target-S1PRs in human hippocampal biopsy tissue of pharmacoresistant TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for seizure relief suggests repurposing of fingolimod as novel therapeutic perspective in focalepilepsies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms after daclizumab therapy.,/pubmed/29934423,"OBJECTIVE: To report on 2 women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed severeneurologic deterioration and a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemicsymptoms (DRESS) after treatment with 2 and 4 subcutaneous injections ofdaclizumab, respectively.METHODS: This report includes clinical, MRI, and histopathologic data.RESULTS: Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds theinterleukin-2 receptor. It was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. DRESS is an immunologic reaction to various medications that is characterized byeosinophilia as well as cutaneous and visceral manifestations. Followingdaclizumab treatment, both patients showed fulminant neurologic deteriorationalong with blood eosinophilia and skin changes, and both fulfilled the clinicalcriteria for the diagnosis of DRESS. They presented with multiplegadolinium-enhancing supra- and infratentorial lesions, with lesions in the basalganglia, mesencephalon, and cerebellum. Brain biopsies revealed a pronouncedinflammatory infiltrate including numerous eosinophils infiltrating demyelinatinglesions, a feature that is atypical for MS but compatible with DRESS. Inaddition, numerous plasma cells and changes reminiscent of vasculitis wereevident.CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic deterioration and DRESS occurred as severe adverse drugeffects of daclizumab treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of DRESS areessential because it is associated with complications such as new autoimmunediseases and liver failure, and may even be lethal. Because of its potentialserious side effects, daclizumab was recently suspended for use in the EuropeanUnion.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Retinal vasculitis and systemic diseases].,/pubmed/29933971,"Retinal vasculitis (RV) is an inflammation of retinal blood vessels that can beassociated with uveitis or be isolated, and can induce vascular occlusion andretinal ischemia. Visual acuity can be severely affected in case of macularinvolvement or neovessel formation. The diagnosis relies on fundoscopy andfluorescein angiography. Systemic diseases may be associated with RV, the mostfrequently encountered are Behet's disease, sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis,all predominantly associated with venous involvement, whereas systemic lupuserythematosus and necrotizing vasculitis are less frequently observed andpredominantly associated with arterial or mixed vasculitis. Treatments areusually aggressive in order to preserve a good visual acuity and to reduceretinal inflammation and chronic ischemia. Steroids, immunosuppressive drugs,retinal laser photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are usualtreatments and more recently, anti-TNFalpha monoclonal therapeutic antibodieshave been shown to be very successful.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The tale of histone modifications and its role in multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29933755,"Epigenetics defines the persistent modifications of gene expression in a mannerthat does not involve the corresponding alterations in DNA sequences. It includesmodifications of DNA nucleotides, nucleosomal remodeling, and post-translational modifications (PTMs). It is becoming evident that PTMs which act singly or incombination to form ""histone codes"" orchestrate the chromatin structure anddynamic functions. PTMs of histone tails have been demonstrated to influencenumerous biological developments, as well as disease onset and progression.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating andneurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, of which the precisepathophysiological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. There is a wealth ofemerging evidence that epigenetic modifications may confer risk for MS, whichprovides new insights into MS. Histone PTMs, one of the key events that regulate gene activation, seem to play a prominent role in the epigenetic mechanism of MS.In this review, we summarize recent studies in our understanding of theepigenetic language encompassing histone, with special emphasis on histoneacetylation and histone lysine methylation, two of the best characterized histonemodifications. We also discuss how the current studies address histoneacetylation and histone lysine methylation influencing pathophysiology of MS and how future studies could be designed to establish optimized therapeuticstrategies for MS.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pain Modulation after Oromucosal Cannabinoid Spray (SATIVEX(å¨)) in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Study with Quantitative Sensory Testing and Laser-Evoked Potentials.,/pubmed/29933552,"Background. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) (nabiximols orSativex&reg;) is an oromucosal spray formulation containing THC and CBD at anapproximately 1:1 fixed ratio. Its administration for the treatment of pain inpatients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been established. MS patients generallycomplain of different kinds of pain, including spasticity-related and neuropathicpain. In this study, we compared and evaluated pain modulation and thermal/painthreshold of MS patients before and after THC/CBD administration. Methods. 19 MS patients underwent clinical examination, numerical rating scale (NRS),quantitative sensory testing (QST), and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) before andafter 1 month of therapy. Psychophysiological and neurophysiological data werecompared to sex- and age-matched controls. Results. Patients reported asignificant reduction in pain. We found statistically significant differences in LEP parameters between patients and controls but no significant change in LEPmeasures after THC/CBD therapy. Cold and heat detection thresholds were alteredin patients but did not change after THC/CBD therapy. There was a significantincrease in cold pain threshold by hand stimulation and a significant reductionin abnormal cold perception thresholds. Conclusions. Our results indicate thatSativex&reg; therapy provides pain relief in MS patients and suggest that itmight modulate peripheral cold-sensitive TRP channels.",Single arm,Y,,,,,,,,,
Voxel-Wise Logistic Regression and Leave-One-Source-Out Cross Validation for white matter hyperintensity segmentation.,/pubmed/29932970,"Many algorithms have been proposed for automated segmentation of white matterhyperintensities (WMH) in brain MRI. Yet, broad uptake of any particularalgorithm has not been observed. In this work, we argue that this may be due tovariable and suboptimal validation data and frameworks, precluding directcomparison of methods on heterogeneous data. As a solution, we presentLeave-One-Source-Out Cross Validation (LOSO-CV), which leverages all availabledata for performance estimation, and show that this gives more realistic (lower) estimates of segmentation algorithm performance on data from different scanners. We also develop a FLAIR-only WMH segmentation algorithm: Voxel-Wise LogisticRegression (VLR), inspired by the open-source Lesion Prediction Algorithm (LPA). Our variant facilitates more accurate parameter estimation, and permits intuitiveinterpretation of model parameters. We illustrate the performance of the VLRalgorithm using the LOSO-CV framework with a dataset comprising freely available data from several recent competitions (96 images from 7 scanners). Theperformance of the VLR algorithm (median Similarity Index of 0.69) is compared toits LPA predecessor (0.58), and the results of the VLR algorithm in the 2017 WMH Segmentation Competition are also presented.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction of a palliative approach in the care trajectory among people living with advanced MS: perceptions of home-based health professionals.,/pubmed/29932829,"BACKGROUND: Even with the desire of home-based health professionals to providesupportive care, the palliative needs of people living with multiple sclerosis(MS) remain unmet.AIM: To describe the perceptions of home-based health professionals concerningthe introduction of a palliative care approach in the care trajectory of peopleliving with advanced MS.METHOD: Based on an exploratory qualitative design, focus groups and individualinterviews were conducted with nurses, occupational therapists and social workers(n=13 professionals).RESULTS: A palliative care approach was described as a possibility for openingthe discussion between the patient and their caregivers about their needs anddesires at the end of life. The approach required professionals to be supportive and to adapt their interventions to people living with MS. However, professionalsreported difficulties in introducing a palliative care approach.CONCLUSION: Health professionals reported that they feel a palliative careapproach for people living with MS is mandatory; however, they do not feelcomfortable integrating it systematically into their care.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the risk of multiple sclerosis in the US radiologic technologists cohort study.,/pubmed/29932357,"BACKGROUND: Low exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight may be arisk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Possible pathways may berelated to effects on immune system function or vitamin D insufficiency, as UVRplays a role in the production of the active form of vitamin D in the body.OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether lower levels of residential UVR exposurefrom sunlight were associated with increased MS risk in a cohort of radiologictechnologists.METHODS: Participants in the third and fourth surveys of the US RadiologicTechnologists (USRT) Cohort Study eligible ( N_=_39,801) for analysis providedcomplete residential histories and reported MS diagnoses. MS-specializedneurologists conducted medical record reviews and confirmed 148 cases.Residential locations throughout life were matched to satellite data from NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) project to estimate UVR dose.RESULTS: Findings indicate that MS risk increased as average lifetime levels ofUVR exposures in winter decreased. The effects were consistent across age groups <40_years. There was little indication that low exposures during summer or atolder ages were related to MS risk.CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that UVR exposurereduces MS risk and may ultimately suggest prevention strategies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A framework for measurement and harmonization of pediatric multiple sclerosis etiologic research studies: The Pediatric MS Tool-Kit.,/pubmed/29932341,"BACKGROUND: While studying the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) in childrenhas several methodological advantages over studying etiology in adults, studiesare limited by small sample sizes.OBJECTIVE: Using a rigorous methodological process, we developed the Pediatric MSTool-Kit, a measurement framework that includes a minimal set of core variablesto assess etiological risk factors.METHODS: We solicited input from the International Pediatric MS Study Group toselect three risk factors: environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, sunexposure, and vitamin D intake. To develop the Tool-Kit, we used a Delphi studyinvolving a working group of epidemiologists, neurologists, and content expertsfrom North America and Europe.RESULTS: The Tool-Kit includes six core variables to measure ETS, six to measure sun exposure, and six to measure vitamin D intake. The Tool-Kit can be accessedonline ( www.maelstrom-research.org/mica/network/tool-kit ).CONCLUSION: The goals of the Tool-Kit are to enhance exposure measurement innewly designed pediatric MS studies and comparability of results across studies, and in the longer term to facilitate harmonization of studies, a methodologicalapproach that can be used to circumvent issues of small sample sizes. We believe the Tool-Kit will prove to be a valuable resource to guide pediatric MSresearchers in developing study-specific questionnaire.",N,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro and computational studies on the effects of ARE deletion and targeted mutations on the expression of interferon beta-1a in HEK293T cells.,/pubmed/29931601,"Interferon beta (IFN_) is transiently expressed in response to viral infectionsand widely used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Weintroduced mutations in the IFN_ gene (in the 27th and 101st codons and in theKozak sequence, and also deletion of 3' and 5' unstable, untranslated region,UTR) with the aim of increasing the expression of IFN_. Computational analyses ofmutant and wild-type RNAs and proteins of IFN_ by RNAfold, ASAView, HOPE andRamachandran plot, and iStable web servers showed that the mutations coulddecrease RNA stability, protein solvent accessibility, and protein stability but could not change correct folding. Two recombinant IFN_101 and IFN_101+27constructs were designed by site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type IFN_ genealso was used as a control. In vitro experiments by quantitative real-time PCR,dot blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot assays showed an increased expression level of recombinant IFN_s. 79.9-fold, 99.7-fold, and 190-fold elevations in the mRNAexpression of IFN_w, IFN_101, and IFN_101+27 were seen, respectively, incomparison with the endogenous IFN_ mRNA in untransfected HEK293T cells. The IFN_mRNA expression was increased 2.38-fold and 1.25-fold for 101+27 and 101 mutated forms, respectively, in comparison with the IFN_ wild-type construct. Anelevation in IFN_ protein production was also clearly detected in the transfectedHEK293T cell containing recombinant IFN_101 and IFN_101+27 constructs. Finally,these directed mutations in the IFN_ gene successfully elevated protein and mRNA production but in silico analyses of mutant mRNAs showed decreased mRNAstability, unlike previous studies, in comparison with the wild-type mRNA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prox1 is essential for oligodendrocyte survival and regulates oligodendrocyte apoptosis via the regulation of NOXA.,/pubmed/29931031,"Demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are known to result fromacute or chronic injury to the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination. Itsunderlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. The transcriptionfactor prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1) plays an essential role during embryonicdevelopment of the central nervous system and cell differentiation. Thus, weaimed to investigate the role of Prox1 in the survival and differentiation ofoligodendrocytes. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Flow cytometry wasconducted to analyze cell apoptosis. Ectopic-Prox1 and shProx1 were used for the overexpression and knockdown respectively of Prox1 in FBD-102b cells. Real-timereverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis wereused to assess the alterations of signaling pathway-related mRNAs and proteins,respectively. Results showed that Prox1 was upregulated in differentiatingoligodendrocytes, and Prox1 knockdown inhibited the differentiation ofoligodendrocytes. In addition, overexpression of Prox1 promoted oligodendrocytedifferentiation, as shown by the change in myelin basic protein expression. Theoverexpression of Prox1 had no effect on oligodendrocyte survival, while Prox1knockdown impaired cell survival. Further study demonstrated that Prox1 knockdownpromoted oligodendrocyte apoptosis and activated NOXA, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Knockdown of NOXA by siRNA abrogated Prox1knockdown-induced apoptosis. Our findings indicated that Prox1 regulated thedifferentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the regulation of NOXA.Therefore, Prox1 could be a potential modulator of demyelinating diseases inclinical settings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Development of a Novel Backbone Cyclic Peptide Inhibitor of the Innate Immune TLR/IL1R Signaling Protein MyD88.,/pubmed/29930295,"MyD88 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a central role in signalingdownstream of the TLRs and the IL1R superfamily. We previously demonstrated that MyD88 plays a critical role in EAE, the murine model of multiple sclerosis, andshowed that the MyD88 BB-loop decoy peptide RDVLPGT ameliorates EAE. We nowdesigned and screened a library of backbone cyclized peptides based on the linearBB loop peptide, to identify a metabolically stable inhibitor of MyD88 thatretains the binding properties of the linear peptide. We identified a novelcyclic peptide protein mimetic that inhibits inflammatory responses to TLRligands, and NF_B activation in response to IL-1 activation. The inhibitor, c(MyD4-4), is metabolically stable in comparison to the linear peptide, blocks MyD88in a specific manner, and inhibits MyD88 function by preventing MyD88dimerization. Finally, treatment of mice with c(MyD 4-4) reduced the severity of clinical disease in the murine EAE model of multiple sclerosis. Thus, modulation of MyD88-dependent signaling using c(MyD 4-4) is a potential therapeutic strategyto lower innate immune inflammation in autoimmune CNS disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Morphology-Specific Discrimination between MS White Matter Lesions and Benign White Matter Hyperintensities Using Ultra-High-Field MRI.,/pubmed/29930096,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently published North American Imaging in MultipleSclerosis guidelines call for derivation of a specific radiologic definition ofMS WM lesions and mimics. The purpose of this study was to use SWI andmagnetization-prepared FLAIR images for sensitive differentiation of MS frombenign WM lesions using the morphologic characteristics of WM lesions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 18healthy control subjects were enrolled retrospectively. For each subject, FLAIRand multiecho gradient-echo images were acquired using 7T MR imaging. Optimizedpostprocessing was used to generate single-slice SWI of cerebral veins. SWI/FLAIRimages were registered, and 3 trained readers performed lesion assessment.Morphology, location of lesions, and the time required for assessment wererecorded. Analyses were performed on 3 different pools: 1) lesions of >3 mm, 2)nonconfluent lesions of >3 mm, and 3) nonconfluent lesions of >3 mm with no or a single central vein.RESULTS: The SWI/FLAIR acquisition and processing protocol enabled effectiveassessment of central veins and hypointense rims in WM lesions. Assessment ofnonconfluent lesions with ³1 central vein enabled the most specific and sensitivedifferentiation of patients with MS from controls. A threshold of 67% perivenous WM lesions separated patients with MS from controls with a sensitivity of 94% andspecificity of 100%. Lesion assessment took an average of 12 minutes 10 secondsand 4 minutes 33 seconds for patients with MS and control subjects, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Nonconfluent lesions of >3 mm with ³1 central vein were the mostsensitive and specific differentiators between patients with MS and controlsubjects.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Psychiatric comorbidity increases mortality in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.,/pubmed/29929117,"OBJECTIVE: We determined the association between any common mental disorder (CMD:depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder) and mortality and suicide inthree immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), versus age-, sex-and geographically-matched controls.METHODS: Using administrative data, we identified 28,384 IMID cases (IBD: 8695;MS: 5496; RA: 14,503) and 141,672 matched controls. We determined annual rates ofmortality, suicide and suicide attempts. We evaluated the association of any CMD with all-cause mortality and suicide using multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In the IMID cohort, any CMD was associated with increased mortality. We observed a greater than additive interaction between depression and IMID status(attributable proportion 5.2%), but a less than additive interaction with anxiety(attributable proportion -13%). Findings were similar for MS and RA. In IBD, aless than additive interaction existed with depression and anxiety on mortalityrisk. The IMID cohort with any CMD had an increased suicide risk versus thematched cohort without CMD.CONCLUSION: CMD are associated with increased mortality and suicide risk in IMID.In MS and RA, the effects of depression on mortality risk are greater thanassociations of these IMID and depression alone.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Calcification in cerebral parenchyma affects pharmacoresistant epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis.,/pubmed/29929111,"PURPOSE: Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited diseasecaused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and results in the over-activationof the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is clinically used to treat hamartomatous lesionsas in TSC andits effect on controlling epilepsy is also reported in many studies. This studyaims to evaluate the risk factors of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC receiving long-term rapamycin treatment.METHOD: A total of 108 patients with TSC taking rapamycin for over 1 year wereenrolled in this study. Factors that might influence seizure control werestatistically analyzed by multiple factor analysis. A subgroup analysis was also conducted to access the relationship between calcified epileptic foci andpharmacoresistant epilepsy. (Clinical trial registration number:ChiCTR-OOB-15006535(2015-05-29)).RESULTS: Seizure was controlled in 53 patients but was not managed in 55 patientsconsidered to be drug resistant. Logistic regression analysis showed thatcalcification in the cerebral parenchyma was a risk factor of pharmacoresistantepilepsy [P_=_0.006, odds ratio (OR)_=_4.831 (1.577, 14.795)]. Fifteen of 17patients with calcified epileptic foci suffered from pharmacoresistant epilepsy(88.2%). Seizures in patients with calcified epileptic foci were probablypharmacoresistant (P_=_0.010).CONCLUSION: Calcification in epileptic foci strongly indicates pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC even when treated with appropriate anti-epilepsydrugs (AEDs) and rapamycin. Calcification can be used to evaluatepharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The NRF2 pathway as potential biomarker for dimethyl fumarate treatment in multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29928650,"Objective: Immunological studies have demonstrated a plethora of beneficialeffects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on various cell types. However, the cellularand molecular targets are incompletely understood and response markers arescarce. Here, we focus on the relation between nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) pathway induction under DMF therapy and the composition of theblood immune cell compartment and clinical efficacy in relapsing-remittingmultiple sclerosis (MS) patients.Methods: We explored effects of DMF on peripheral immune cell subsets by flowcytometric and transcriptional analysis of serial blood samples obtained from 43 MS patients during the first year of therapy.Results: Gene expression analysis proved activation of NRF2 signaling under DMFtherapy that was paralleled by a temporal expansion of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells,CD56bright natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a decrease in CD8+ T cells, B cells, and type 1 myeloid dendritic cells. In a subgroup of 28patients with completely available clinical data, individuals with higher levels of the NRF2 target gene NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) 4-6 weeks afterDMF therapy initiation were more likely to achieve no evidence of diseaseactivity status 1 year later. The degree of NQO1 induction further correlatedwith patient age.Interpretation: We demonstrate that positive effects of DMF on the clinicaloutcome are paralleled by induction of the antioxidant NRF2 transcriptionalpathway and a shift toward regulatory immune cell subsets in the periphery. Ourdata identify a role of the NRF2 pathway as potential biomarker for DMF treatmentin MS.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Hypothyroxinemia Affects Its Offspring With a Reduced Suppressive Capacity Impairing the Outcome of the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.,/pubmed/29928277,"Hypothyroxinemia (Hpx) is a thyroid hormone deficiency (THD) condition highlyfrequent during pregnancy, which although asymptomatic for the mother, it canimpair the cognitive function of the offspring. Previous studies have shown that maternal hypothyroidism increases the severity of experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune disease model for multiple sclerosis (MS).Here, we analyzed the immune response after EAE induction in the adult offspring gestated in Hpx. Mice gestated in Hpx showed an early appearance of EAE symptoms and the increase of all parameters of the disease such as: the pathologicalscore, spinal cord demyelination, and immune cell infiltration in comparison tothe adult offspring gestated in euthyroidism. Isolated CD4+CD25+ T cells fromspleen of the offspring gestated in Hpx that suffer EAE showed reduced capacityto suppress proliferation of effector T cells (TEff) after being stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Moreover, adoptive transfer experiments ofCD4+CD25+ T cells from the offspring gestated in Hpx suffering EAE to mice thatwere induced with EAE showed that the receptor mice suffer more intense EAEpathological score. Even though, no significant differences were detected in the frequency of Treg cells and IL-10 content in the blood, spleen, and brain betweenmice gestated in Hpx or euthyroidism, T cells CD4+CD25+ from spleen have reduced capacity to differentiate in vitro to Treg and to produce IL-10. Thus, our datasupport the notion that maternal Hpx can imprint the immune response of theoffspring suffering EAE probably due to a reduced capacity to triggersuppression. Such ""imprints"" on the immune system could contribute to explaining as to why adult offspring gestated in Hpx suffer earlier and more intense EAE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Therapeutic potential of medicinal marijuana: an educational primer for health care professionals.,/pubmed/29928146,"With the proposed Canadian July 2018 legalization of marijuana through theCannabis Act, a thorough critical analysis of the current trials on the efficacy of medicinal marijuana (MM) as a treatment option is necessary. This review isparticularly important for primary care physicians whose patients may beinterested in using MM as an alternative therapy. In response to increasedinterest in MM, Health Canada released a document in 2013 for generalpractitioners (GPs) as an educational tool on the efficacy of MM in treating somechronic and acute conditions. Although additional studies have filled in some of the gaps since the release of the Health Canada document, conflicting andinconclusive results continue to pose a challenge for physicians. This reviewaims to supplement the Health Canada document by providing physicians with acritical yet concise update on the recent advancements made regarding theefficacy of MM as a potential therapeutic option. An update to the literature of 2013 is important given the upcoming changes in legislation on the use ofmarijuana. Also, we briefly highlight the current recommendations provided byCanadian medical colleges on the parameters that need to be considered prior toauthorizing MM use, routes of administration as well as a general overview of theendocannabinoid system as it pertains to cannabis. Lastly, we outline theappropriate medical conditions for which the authorization of MM may present as apractical alternative option in improving patient outcomes as well as individual considerations of which GPs should be mindful. The purpose of this paper is tooffer physicians an educational tool that provides a necessary, evidence-basedanalysis of the therapeutic potential of MM and to ensure physicians are makingdecisions on the therapeutic use of MM in good faith.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of evening primrose oil on fatigue and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29928122,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive and inflammatorydisease of the central nervous system that is characterized by demyelination inthe central nervous system. In regard to the prevalence of diseases and enormous costs imposed on society and the health system, finding a way to stop theprogression of the disease using drugs with fewer side effects seems a serioussanitation issue to the health of the international community. This study aimedto evaluate the effect of evening primrose oil (EPO) on fatigue and quality oflife in patients with MS.Materials and methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 52patients with MS were chosen and categorized into 2 groups which received 2 dosesof EPO and placebo. In addition, the quality of life and fatigue scale in thesepatients were investigated before the treatment and again 3 months after therapy.The findings were then compared between the 2 groups.Result: EPO consumption significantly increased cognitive function, vitality, andoverall life satisfaction and also reduced pain and fatigue compared to placebo(P<0.05).Conclusion: Our findings indicated that EPO consumption had no impact on thequality of life in general; however, it had a significant effect on severalimportant aspects of life quality such as the increase of cognitive function,vitality, and overall life satisfaction. It also reduced the pain and fatigue in comparison to the placebo consumption. Herbal medicines are brittle and havefewer side effects than chemical drugs. With use of this plant, reduced fatigueand improved quality of life were observed in MS patients.

The long-term costs for treating multiple sclerosis in a 16-year retrospective cohort study in Brazil.,/pubmed/29928006,"BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that appreciably impacts on the quality of life of patients and is associated with high expenditure. MS is achronic multifactorial disease, characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. The Brazilian public health system provides pharmacologicaltreatment as well as hospital and outpatient care for patients withrelapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, we arenot aware of any previous publications assessing total direct medical costs inpatients with a long follow-up within the Brazilian healthcare system.Consequently, the objective is to analyze public spending on patients with MS to guide stakeholders in future investment and disinvestment decisions.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We retrospectively analyzed public Brazilian spending onpatients with MS between 2000 and 2015 using the patient-centered registry of allpatients in the public health system (SUS) obtained throughdeterministic-probabilistic record linkage of the Outpatient Information System, Hospital Information System and Mortality Information Systems in Brazil.Descriptive data analysis and a multiple linear regression model was performed toevaluate the associations between the mean annual cost per patient and theclinical and demographic variables. The suitability of the model was verifiedfrom a residue analysis and the level of significance adopted was 5%.RESULTS: 28,401 patients were identified and subsequently 23,082 patients wereanalyzed. The majority of the patients were female (73.3%), lived in thesoutheast region (58.9%), had a mean age of 36.8 (± 12.2) years and startedtreatment using one of the interferons beta (78.9%). The total direct medicalcost spending in the sixteen years of the follow-up was US $ 2,308,393,465.60,and the mean annual expenditure per patient was US $ 13,544.40 (± 4,607.05). Inthe best fit model (p <0.001), approximately 40% of the variability of the meanannual cost per patient was explained by the region of residence; medication used(intention to treat); if the patient was a non-exclusive user of medicines, i.e.,used SUS for other procedures other than high-cost medicines; year of treatmentstart; and presence of events (death; Relapse; change of treatment and/orcomorbidity).CONCLUSIONS: In the public health system of Brazil, disease modifying therapiescurrently represent almost all of the total direct costs of multiple sclerosistreatment. Around the world, new and emerging health technologies to treat of MS impose a challenge to health budgets, highlighting the need forcost-effectiveness studies comparing these technologies to those alreadyavailable.

Mean age andmean disease duration were 30.9 ± 9.3 years and 11.4 ± 6.9 years, respectively.Fifty-one patients received prior first-line disease-modifying therapies, 11patients were previously treated with natalizumab, and 1 was treatment naive. TheARR decreased by 75.3% for the total population at the end of the first year oftreatment (P < 0.0001). The proportion of relapse-free patients improvedsignificantly. All patients previously treated with natalizumab switched because of safety concerns, although the ARR kept low after treatment initiation. Only 3 patients (4.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse drug reactions, and 2(3.2%) because of lack of effectiveness.CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world audit, fingolimod appeared to be effective after first-line treatment failure in reducing disease activity and progression ofdisability throughout the observational period and may be an effective optionafter natalizumab. Fingolimod was well tolerated with low rates ofdiscontinuation and adverse events.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
A controlled clinical trial on the effects of exercise on cognition and mobility in adults with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29927751,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a 6-month exercise program on cognition and mobility in participants with multiple sclerosis.DESIGN: Prospective, single blind, controlled clinical trial.SETTING: A community rehabilitation program within a large metropolitan healthservice.PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis, referred foroutpatient rehabilitation.INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated to one of two groups and undertook acognitive-motor exercise program or monitoring (control group).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognition and mobility. Cognition was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal Assessment Battery. Mobility wasassessed with the Timed Get-Up-and-Go-Test, applied with and without dual taskdistractors.RESULTS: The findings showed benefits provided by exercise on cognition andmobility. Differently, participants of the control group did not have significantchanges in cognition scores after 6 months of follow-up, and had a worseperformance in mobility tests.CONCLUSION: Six months of exercise provided benefits to cognition and mobility inadults with multiple sclerosis.

Disability Outcome Measures in Phase III Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/29926371,"Accumulating neurological disability has a substantial impact on the lives ofpatients with multiple sclerosis (MS). As well as the established ExpandedDisability Status Scale (EDSS), several other outcome measures are now available for assessing disability progression in MS. This review extends the findings of aprevious analysis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) trials published up to 2012,to determine whether there has been a shift in outcome measures used to assessdisability in phase III clinical trials in RRMS and progressive MS. Fortyrelevant trials were identified (RRMS, nÊ=Ê16; progressive MS, nÊ=Ê18;other/mixed phenotypes, nÊ=Ê6). Sustained EDSS worsening, particularly over 3months, was included as an endpoint in almost all identified trials. Otherdisability-related endpoints included the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Compositez-score and scores for the physical component summary of the Multiple SclerosisImpact Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form (36-item) Health Survey. Testsassessing manual dexterity, ambulation, vision and cognition were also employed, and in some trials, composite endpoints were used. However, there was no obvious trend in choice of disability outcome measures over time. Sustained EDSSworsening over short time periods continues to be the most widely used measure ofdisability progression in pivotal MS trials, despite its well-recognisedlimitations. A new tool set is needed for use in MS clinical trials that detects the benefit of potential treatments that slow (or reverse) progressivedisability.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Incidental diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex by exome sequencing in three families with subclinical findings.,/pubmed/29926239,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disordercharacterized by lesions and benign tumors in multiple organ systems includingthe brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, and lungs. The phenotype is highlyvariable, although penetrance is reportedly complete. We report the moleculardiagnosis of TSC in individuals exhibiting extreme intra-familial variability,including the incidental diagnosis of asymptomatic family members. Exomesequencing was performed in three families, with probands referred for epilepsy, autism, and absent speech (Family 1); epileptic spasms (Family 2); and connectivetissue disorders (Family 3.) Pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2 were identified in nine individuals, including relatives with limited or no medical concerns atthe time of testing. Of the nine individuals reported here, six hadpost-diagnosis examinations and three met clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC.One did not meet clinical criteria for a possible or definite diagnosis of TSC,and two had only a possible clinical diagnosis following post-diagnosis workup.These individuals as well as their mothers demonstrated limited features thatwould not raise concern for TSC in the absence of molecular results. In addition,three individuals exhibited epilepsy with normal brain MRIs, and two withoutseizures or intellectual disability had MRI findings fulfilling major criteriafor TSC highlighting the difficulty providers face when relying on clinicalcriteria to guide genetic testing. Given the importance of a timely TSC diagnosisfor clinical management, such cases demonstrate a potential benefit for clinical criteria to include seizures and an unbiased molecular approach to genetictesting.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reassessing B cell contributions in multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29925992,"There is growing recognition that B cell contributions to normal immune responsesextend well beyond their potential to become antibody-producing cells, including roles at the innate-adaptive interface and their potential to modulate theresponses of other immune cells such as T cells and myeloid cells.

Weoutline the clinical features of neuroimmune disorders, the current approaches totheir treatment and new approaches in development. We then consider thepathological features, including biomarkers, pathological mechanisms andgenetics, and discuss the value of immune assays in clinical investigation andbasic research. On the basis of current knowledge and techniques, we propose fourresearch priorities: rigorous and consistent collection of core clinical data,cooperative investigation of treatments, development of biological assays andgenetic studies. These priorities should help us to achieve the shared goalofÊprecision medicine for neuroimmune disorders. However, multicentre researchand the creation of clinical consortia for these rare disorders will benecessary, and we hope that this Review serves as a call to action that is timelygiven current exciting advances in neuroimmune therapeutics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Human IgM antibody rHIgM22 promotes phagocytic clearance of myelin debris by microglia.,/pubmed/29925848,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelinated CNS lesions fail to sufficientlyremyelinate, despite the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)capable of differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes. MS lesions containdamaged myelin debris that can inhibit OPC maturation and hinder repair. rHIgM22 is an experimental human recombinant IgM antibody that promotes remyelination in animal models and is being examined in patients with MS. rHIgM22 binds to CNSmyelin and partially rescues OPC process outgrowth on myelin. Since rHIgM22 does not affect OPC process outgrowth in vitro on permissive substrate, we examinedthe possibility that it acts by enhancing phagocytic clearance of myelin debrisby microglia. In this study, we tested if rHIgM22 binding could tag myelin formicroglial phagocytosis. A mouse microglial cell line and primary rat microgliawere treated with myelin and rHIgM22 and assayed for myelin phagocytosis. Wefound that: 1) rHIgM22 stimulates myelin phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner;2) rHIgM22-mediated myelin phagocytosis requires actin polymerization; and 3)rHIgM22-stimulation of myelin phagocytosis requires activity of rHIgM22 Fc domainand activation of Complement Receptor 3. Since myelin inhibits OPCdifferentiation, stimulation of phagocytic clearance of damaged myelin may be an important means by which rHIgM22 promotes remyelination.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Three-Tesla MRI does not improve the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: A multicenter study.,/pubmed/29925550,"OBJECTIVE: In the work-up of patients presenting with a clinically isolatedsyndrome (CIS), 3T MRI might offer a higher lesion detection than 1.5T, but itremains unclear whether this affects the fulfilment of the diagnostic criteriafor multiple sclerosis (MS).METHODS: We recruited 66 patients with CIS within 6 months from symptom onset and26 healthy controls in 6 MS centers. All participants underwent 1.5T and 3T brainand spinal cord MRI at baseline according to local optimized protocols and theMAGNIMS guidelines. Patients who had not converted to MS during follow-upreceived repeat brain MRI at 3-6 months and 12-15 months. The number of lesionsper anatomical region was scored by 3 raters in consensus. Criteria fordissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT) were determinedaccording to the 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria.RESULTS: Three-Tesla MRI detected 15% more T2 brain lesions compared to 1.5T (p <0.001), which was driven by an increase in baseline detection of periventricular (12%, p = 0.015), (juxta)cortical (21%, p = 0.005), and deep white matter lesions(21%, p < 0.001). The detection rate of spinal cord lesions andgadolinium-enhancing lesions did not differ between field strengths. Three-Tesla MRI did not lead to a higher number of patients fulfilling the criteria for DISor DIT, or subsequent diagnosis of MS, at any of the 3 time points.CONCLUSION: Scanning at 3T does not influence the diagnosis of MS according toMcDonald diagnostic criteria.",N,,,,,,,,,,

"Microenvironment proteinases, proteinase-activated receptor regulation, cancer and inflammation.",/pubmed/29924723,"We propose that in the microenvironment of inflammatory tissues, includingtumours, extracellular proteinases can modulate cell signalling in part byregulating proteinaseactivated receptors (PARs). We have been exploring thismechanism in a variety of inflammation and tumour-related settings that includetumour-derived cultured cells from prostate and bladder cancer, as well as immuneinflammatory cells that are involved in the pathology of inflammatory diseasesincluding multiple sclerosis. Our work shows that proteinase signalling via thePARs affects prostate and bladder cancer-derived tumour cell behaviour and canregulate calcium signalling in human T-cell and macrophage-related inflammatorycells as well as in murine splenocytes. Further, we find that the tumour-derived prostate cancer cells and immune-related cells (Jurkat, THP1, mouse splenocytes) can produce PAR-regulating proteinases (including kallikreins: KLKs), that cancontrol tissue function by both a paracrine and autocrine mechanism. We suggestthat this PAR-driven signalling process involving secreted microenvironmentproteinases can play a key role in cancer and inflammatory diseases includingmultiple sclerosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Using Acutely Dissociated and Purified Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells for High-Throughput Drug Screening to Identify Compounds that Promote Oligodendrocyte Differentiation.,/pubmed/29924487,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that involves an immune-mediatedinflammatory response in the central nervous system and optic nerve resulting in demyelination and neural degeneration, the cause of which is unknown. The adultcentral nervous system has the capacity to remyelinate axons by generating newoligodendrocytes (OLs). To identify clinical candidate compounds that may promoteremyelination, we have developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay toidentify compounds that promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into OLs. Using acutely dissociated and purified rat OPCs coupledwith immunofluorescent image quantification, we have developed an OLdifferentiation assay. Building on OPC culturing techniques developed over thepast 30 years, we have scaled up the isolation and purification process togenerate sufficient quantities for HTS. We then describe the use of these acutelyderived OPCs in an assay designed to identify compounds that promotedifferentiation into OLs.

Tuberous sclerosis complex: review based on new diagnostic criteria.,/pubmed/29924239,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is a multisystemic, autosomal dominant geneticdisorder with complete penetrance, that can evolve with hamartomas in multipleorgans, such as skin, central nervous system, kidney and lung. Due to the widephenotypic variability, the disease is often not recognized. Tuberous sclerosiscomplex affects one in 10,000 newborns and most patients are diagnosed during thefirst 15 months of life. The diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis werereviewed in 2012, at the second International Tuberous Sclerosis ComplexConsensus Conference. The diagnosis is based on genetic criteria, by theidentification of inactivating pathogenic mutation of tumor suppressor genes TSC1and TSC2, and clinical criteria, including cutaneous, renal, pulmonary, cardiacand neurological manifestations. The treatment of tuberous sclerosis complexconsists, mainly, in management of the symptoms caused by hamartomas and inprevention of organ failure.

CD93 regulates CNS inflammation in two mouse models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,/pubmed/29923617,"Microglia and non-professional immune cells (endothelial cells, neurons)participate in the recognition and removal of pathogens and tissue-debris in the injured CNS through major pro-inflammatory processes. However, the mechanismsinvolved in regulating these responses remain ill-characterised. We herein showthat CD93 also known as complement C1qRp/AA4 stem cell marker has an importantrole in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The role of CD93 was evaluated in two models of neuroinflammation. We used the MOG-experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the antibody-dependent EAE (ADEAE) which wereinduced in wild type and CD93 knockout mice. We found that CD93 was highlyexpressed by neurons, endothelial cells and microglia (ramified >> amoeboid).Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes did not to express CD93. We further observed thatCD93 deficient (CD93-/-) mice presented a more robust brain and spinal cordinflammation in EAE and ADEAE. Encephalitis in CD93-/- was characterized byincreased numbers of infiltrating M1 macrophages (CD11c+ CD206-) and amoeboidmicroglia exhibiting a more activated phenotype (Tomato Lectinhigh , Cox2high ). Damage and leakage of the blood brain barrier was increased in CD93-/- animalsand was associated with a more robust neuronal injury when compared to wild type EAE mice. We propose that CD93 is an important neuro-immune regulator (NIREG) to control CNS inflammation. This article is protected by copyright. All rightsreserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,

When does economic model type become a decisive factor in health technology appraisals? Learning from the expanding treatment options for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29923439,"OBJECTIVES: Specific economic model types often become de facto standard forhealth technology appraisal over time. Markov and discrete event simulation (DES)models were compared to investigate the impact of innovative modelling oncost-effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in relapsing-remittingmultiple sclerosis (RRMS). Fingolimod was compared to dimethyl fumarate (DMF; in highly-active [HA] RRMS), alemtuzumab (in HA RRMS), and natalizumab (inrapidly-evolving severe RRMS). Comparator DMTs were chosen to reflect differentdosing regimens.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov and DES models used were published previously.Inputs were aligned in all relevant respects, with differences in the modellingof event-triggered attributes, such as relapse-related retreatment, which isinherently difficult with a memoryless Markov approach. Outcomes were compared,with and without different attributes.RESULTS: All results used list prices. For the comparison of fingolimod and DMF, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were comparable (Markov:£4,206/quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained versus DES: £3,910/QALY gained). Deviations were observed when long-term AEs were incorporated in the DES (Markov:£25,412 saved/QALY lost, versus DES: £34,209 saved/QALY lost, fingolimod versusnatalizumab; higher ICERs indicate greater cost-effectiveness). For fingolimodversus alemtuzumab, when relapse-triggered retreatment was included in the DES,large cost differences were observed (difference between incremental cost is£35,410 and QALY is 0.10).LIMITATIONS: UK payer perspective, therefore societal approach was notconsidered. Resource utilisation and utilities for both models were not derivedfrom the subpopulations; as the focus is on model type, input limitations thatapply to both models are less relevant.CONCLUSIONS: Whilst no model can fully represent a disease, a DES allows anopportunity to include features excluded in a Markov structure. A DES may be moresuitable for modelling in RRMS for health technology assessment purposes giventhe complexity of some DMTs. This analysis highlights the capabilities ofdifferent model structures to model event-triggered attributes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Thalamic white matter in multiple sclerosis: A combined diffusion-tensor imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping study.,/pubmed/29923266,"Thalamic white matter (WM) injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains relativelypoorly understood. Combining multiple imaging modalities, sensitive to different tissue properties, may aid in further characterizing thalamic damage. Forty-five MS patients and 17 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC) were scannedwith 3T MRI to obtain quantitative measures of diffusivity and magneticsusceptibility. Participants underwent cognitive evaluation with the BriefInternational Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis battery. Tract-basedspatial statistics identified thalamic WM. Non-parametric combination (NPC)analysis was used to perform joint inference on fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and magnetic susceptibility measures. The association ofsurrounding WM lesions and thalamic WM pathology was investigated with lesionprobability mapping. Compared to HCs, the greatest extent of thalamic WM damagewas reflected by the combination of increased MD and decreased magneticsusceptibility (63.0% of thalamic WM, peak pÊ=Ê.001). Controlling for thalamicvolume resulted in decreased FA and magnetic susceptibility (34.1%, peakpÊ=Ê.004) as showing the greatest extent. In MS patients, the most widespreadassociation with information processing speed was found with the combination ofMD and magnetic susceptibility (67.6%, peak pÊ=Ê.0005), although this was notevident after controlling for thalamic volume. For memory measures, MD aloneyielded the most widespread associations (45.9%, peak pÊ=Ê.012 or 76.7%, peakpÊ=Ê.001), even after considering thalamic volume, albeit with smallerpercentages.

Using the Anterior Visual System to Assess Neuroprotection and Remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis Trials.,/pubmed/29923130,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clinical trials using agents directed at neuroprotection andremyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are needed. As optic neuritis (ON) iscommon in people with MS and the pathology of ON is similar to other MS lesionsin the brain, measurements of the anterior visual system are frequently utilized in neuroprotection and remyelination trials. Understanding the strengths andweaknesses of the measurements is vital when interpreting the results of thisresearch.RECENT FINDINGS: Techniques such as visual evoked potentials (VEP) and opticalcoherence tomography (OCT) are well established in MS and are thought to measure axonal integrity and myelination. Novel imaging techniques can also be used inconjunction with these measurements to provide better insight into optic nervestructure and function. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTR) together with optic nerve area and volume measures neurodegeneration; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures myelination status and neurodegeneration. However, these techniquesrequire various levels of experience to interpret, and all can be confounded byocular motion and surrounding fat and bone. This article provides a review ofestablished and novel techniques to measure the anterior visual system inmultiple sclerosis with a focus on the evidence to support their use as outcomemeasures in clinical trials focused on neuroprotection and remyelinationtherapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Brief Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS).,/pubmed/29923070,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease of the central nervous systemwhich can lead to a range of severe physical disabilities. A large proportion of those affected will experience cognitive impairment, which is associated with aworse prognosis. Effective assessment of cognition in MS has been problematic dueto a lack of suitable scales. The Brief International Cognitive Assessment forMultiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) was developed in 2010 as part of an internationalendeavour to facilitate cognitive assessment.AIM: The aim of this systematicreview and meta-analysis was to synthesise the available literature published as part of the BICAMS international validation protocol.METHODS: A literature search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar identified 16 studies for inclusion in the systematic review, 14 of which couldbe included in a meta-analysis.RESULTS: BICAMS has been widely validated across 11 languages and 14 individualcultures and locations. The meta-analysis demonstrated that BICAMS identifiedsignificantly reduced cognitive functioning in adults with MS compared to healthycontrols.

Cannabinoids for Treatment of MS Symptoms: State of the Evidence.,/pubmed/29923025,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cannabis and cannabinoids have been used medically andrecreationally for thousands of years and recently there has been a growing body of research in this area. With increased access now that medical marijuana isavailable in many jurisdictions, patients and providers want to know more aboutthe evidence for benefits and risks of cannabinoid use. This paper provides anoverview of the available cannabinoid-based formulations, a summary of thehighest quality evidence for the use of cannabinoids for treating spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), and a discussion of possible dosingregimens based on information from these studies.RECENT FINDINGS: Two recent high-quality systematic reviews concluded that theonly strong evidence for medical marijuana in neurological disorders was forreducing the symptoms of patient-reported spasticity and central pain in MS andthat the only complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention in MSwith strong supportive evidence was cannabinoids. Based on this review, theyconcluded that nabiximols (Sativex oral spray), oral cannabis extract (OCE), and synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably effective at reducingpatient-reported symptoms of spasticity in people with MS, but OCE and synthetic THC were not found to be effective for reducing physician-administered measuresof spasticity. In addition, nabiximols, OCE, and synthetic THC are probablyeffective at reducing MS-related pain. Cannabinoids were generallywell-tolerated. However, cannabis use has been associated with an increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia in at-risk individuals, there is growing evidence that cannabis can increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, includingmyocardial infarction (MI), hypertension, heart failure, and stroke, and arecently recognized adverse effect of cannabis is cannabinoid hyperemesissyndrome. The medical use of cannabinoids remains controversial. Whilecannabinoids have been studied for a variety of neurologic disorders, there isstrongest evidence to indicate benefits in treatment of spasticity andneuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Although the best dose for an individual remains uncertain, most participants in the studies discussed in this paper used between 20 and 40Êmg of THC a day in divided doses. Adverse events in studieswere generally more common in the groups using cannabinoid products but seriousadverse events were rare and cannabis products were generally well-tolerated.Cannabis use does appear to be associated with increased risk of certain adverse events, including psychosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cannabinoid hyperemesissyndrome.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Is there a link between inflammation and fatigue in multiple sclerosis?,/pubmed/29922081,"Purpose: Among autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system stands multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by demyelination, synaptopathy, andneurodegeneration. MS fatigue can affect up to 90% of patients and be verydisabling, with a drastic impact on their quality of life. To date, theevaluation of MS fatigue has relied mainly on subjective scales, and actualtherapeutic interventions are challenged by modest efficacy and numerousundesirable effects. Therefore, finding biomarkers of MS fatigue might help inoptimizing evaluation and treatment strategies. The main objective here was toassess the relationship between MS fatigue and inflammatory or otherimmunomediated markers.Methods: Research was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Computerizeddatabases (ie, PubMed/Medline and Scopus) were consulted till February 2018aiming to identify articles that addressed inflammation and MS fatigue. Studiesin English and French published at any time were considered.Results: A total of 27 studies matched the research criteria. Inconsistencyexisted regarding the relationship between fatigue and the orexin A system,hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and cerebrospinal fluid inflammatorymarkers. As for peripheral markers, although there was scarcity in the available data, serum proinflammatory cytokines (ie, IL6, TNF_, and IFN_) seem to beassociated with MS fatigue. Finally, no link was found between MS fatigue andT-cell populations (ie, CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells) or otherperipheral markers of inflammation (ie, CRP, erythrocyte-sedimentation rate,soluble ICAM1).Conclusion: Future large-scale studies would benefit from comparing therelationship between fatigue and immune measures in patients with differentdisease phenotypes with and without disease-modifying drugs. With the subjective nature of fatigue scales, finding objective biomarkers for fatigue would be ofgreat help.",N,,,,,,,,,,
DNA methylation as a mediator of HLA-DRB1*15:01 and a protective variant in multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29921915,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DRB1*15:01 is the major risk factorfor multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we find that DRB1*15:01 is hypomethylated and predominantly expressed in monocytes among carriers of DRB1*15:01. Adifferentially methylated region (DMR) encompassing HLA-DRB1 exon 2 isparticularly affected and displays methylation-sensitive regulatory properties invitro. Causal inference and Mendelian randomization provide evidence that HLAvariants mediate risk for MS via changes in the HLA-DRB1 DMR that modify HLA-DRB1expression. Meta-analysis of 14,259 cases and 171,347 controls confirms thatthese variants confer risk from DRB1*15:01 and also identifies a protectivevariant (rs9267649, p_<_3.32___10-8, odds ratio_=_0.86) after conditioning forall MS-associated variants in the region. rs9267649 is associated with increased DNA methylation at the HLA-DRB1 DMR and reduced expression of HLA-DRB1,suggesting a modulation of the DRB1*15:01 effect.

Therefore,we aimed to investigate if progressive retinal neuroaxonal damage occurs inaquaporin4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD.METHODS: Out of 157 patients with NMOSD screened, 94 eyes of 51 patients without optic neuritisÊ(ON) during follow-up (F/U) and 56 eyes of 28 age-matched andsex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included (median F/U 2.3 years). The NMOSDcohort included 60 eyes without (EyeON-) and 34 eyes with a history of ON priorto enrolment (EyeON+). Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (pRNFL),fovea thickness (FT), volumes of the combined ganglion cell and inner plexiformlayer (GCIP) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) and total macular volume (TMV)were acquired by optical coherence tomography (OCT).RESULTS: At baseline, GCIP, FT and TMV were reduced in EyeON+ (GCIP p<2e-16; FTp=3.7e-4; TMV p=3.7e-12) andÊin EyeON-Ê(GCIP p=0.002; FT p=0.040; TMV p=6.1e-6)compared with HC. Longitudinally, we observed GCIP thinning in EyeON- (p=0.044)but not in EyeON+. Seven patients had attacks during F/U; they presented pRNFLthickening compared withÊpatients without attacks (p=0.003).CONCLUSION: This study clearly shows GCIP loss independent of ON attacks inaquaporin4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD. Potential explanations for progressiveGCIP thinning include primary retinopathy, drug-induced neurodegeneration andretrograde neuroaxonal degeneration from lesions or optic neuropathy. pRNFLthickening in the patients presenting with attacks during F/U might be indicativeof pRNFL susceptibility to inflammation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effects of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on employment measures using patient-reported data.,/pubmed/29921609,"BACKGROUND: The direct comparative evidence on treatment effects of availablemultiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is limited, and fewstudies have examined the benefits of DMTs on employment outcomes. We comparedthe effects of DMTs used in the previous 5_years on improving the workattendance, amount of work and work productivity of people with MS.METHODS: The Australian MS Longitudinal Study collected data from participants onDMTs usage from 2010 to 2015 and whether DMTs contributed to changes inemployment outcomes. We classified 11 DMTs into three categories based on theirclinical efficacy (_-interferons and glatiramer acetate as category 1;teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate as category 2; fingolimod, natalizumab,alemtuzumab and mitoxantrone as category 3). Each DMT used by a participant wastreated as one observation and analysed by log-multinomial regression.RESULTS: Of the 874 participants included, 1384 observations were generated.Those who used category 3 (higher efficacy) DMTs were 2-3 times more likely toreport improvements in amount of work, work attendance and work productivitycompared with those who used category 1 (classical injectable) DMTs. Natalizumab was associated with superior beneficial effects on patient-reported employmentoutcomes than fingolimod (RR=1.76,Ê95%ÊCIÊ1.02_toÊ3.03 for increased workattendance and RR=1.46, 95% CIÊ1.02 to 2.10 for increased work productivity).CONCLUSIONS: Those using the higher efficacy (category 3) DMTs, particularlyfingolimod and natalizumab, reported significant increases in amount of work,work attendance and work productivity, suggesting they have important beneficial effects on work life in people with MS.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Potential application of venom proteins in designing of medicines for treating human neurodegenerative disorders.,/pubmed/29921193,"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorder are persistently increasing andrelentlessly affecting the individuals, families and society as whole.Regrettably these disorders are resistant to the available drugs, the outcomesare only palliative while the side effects of the therapy harm the patientcompliance as well as treatment. Drugs from venomous source have been considered as an effective alternative for such types of disorders, particularlyneurodegenerative diseases. Due to emerging advancement in the field ofproteomics, genomics and molecular biology, characterization and screening ofthese novel compounds become more assessable.CONCLUSION: In this reverence, the present study reviews the currentconsideration of the mode of action and the future prediction concerning the use of novel compounds isolated from arthropods and other venomous animals in thetreatment of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease,Alzheimer disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy and Amyotrophic LateralSclerosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
RANKL/RANK/OPG Axis Is Deregulated in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Multiple Sclerosis Patients at Clinical Onset.,/pubmed/29920500,"OBJECTIVES: Our study focused on the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclearfactor-_B ligand)/RANK/OPG (osteoprotegerin) axis and selectedproinflammatory/immunoregulatory upstream mediators in the peripheral blood (PBL)and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.METHODS: PBL and CSF were collected from healthy controls (n = 35) and MSpatients at the clinical onset of the disease (n = 33). In addition, PBL samples were obtained from relapse-remitting (RR)-MS patients (n = 30). Patients wereassessed by means of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and routinelaboratory parameters. Soluble (s)RANKL and OPG were measured in the CSF andplasma; gene expression was detected for RANKL, RANK, OPG, and selectedcytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-10, IL-17, CCL2, and CXCL12) in PBL mononuclear cells.RESULTS: The OPG level in the CSF was lower in MS patients at clinical onset thanin controls. Moreover, the sRANKL/OPG ratio was higher in the CSF of MS patients at clinical onset and in the plasma of RR-MS patients than in controls. Geneexpression of RANKL/RANK/OPG in PBL mononuclear cells was higher only in RR-MSpatients. IL-4, CCL2, and CXCL12 were positively correlated and IL-10 wasnegatively correlated with RANKL/RANK expression. OPG was negatively correlatedwith EDSS and alkaline phosphatase level.CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that changes of RANKL/RANK/OPG axis are associatedwith MS, particularly the decreased OPG level in the CSF at disease onset.Therefore, these factors may serve as disease biomarkers and molecular targets ofnovel therapeutic approaches.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Main inherited neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxias, how to recognize them using magnetic resonance imaging?",/pubmed/29920348,"Ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from brainstem, cerebellar,and/or spinocerebellar tract impairments. Symptom onset could vary widely fromchildhood to late-adulthood. Autosomal cerebellar ataxias are considered as oneof the most complex groups in neurogenetics. In addition to their geneticheterogeneity, there is an important phenotypic variability in the expression of cerebellar impairment, complicating the genetic mutation research. A patternrecognition approach using brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of atrophy, hyperintensities and iron-induced hypointensity of the dentate nuclei could betherefore helpful in guiding genetic research. This review will discuss a patternrecognition approach that, associated with the age at disease onset, and clinicalmanifestations, may help neuroradiologists differentiate the most frequentprofiles of ataxia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Lack of junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-B ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,/pubmed/29920328,"In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) autoaggressive CD4+ T cells cross the blood-brain barrier(BBB) and cause neuroinflammation. Therapeutic targeting of CD4+ T-celltrafficking into the CNS by blocking _4-integrins has proven beneficial for thetreatment of MS but comes with associated risks, probably due to blocking CD8+ T cell mediated CNS immune surveillance. Our recent observations show that CD8+ Tcells also rely on _4_1-integrins to cross the BBB. Besides vascular celladhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), we identified junctional adhesion molecule-B(JAM-B) as a novel vascular _4_1-integrin ligand involved in CD8+ T-cellmigration across the BBB. This prompted us to investigate, if JAM-B also mediatesCD4+ T-cell migration across the BBB. We first ensured that encephalitogenic Tcells can bind to JAM-B in vitro and next compared EAE pathogenesis in JAM-B-/-C57BL/6J mice and their wild-type littermates. Following immunization withMOGaa35-55 peptide, JAM-B-/- mice developed ameliorated EAE compared to theirwild-type littermates. At the same time, we isolated higher numbers of CD45+infiltrating immune cells from the CNS of JAM-B-/- C57BL/6J mice suffering fromEAE. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the majority of CD45+ inflammatorycells accumulated in the leptomeningeal and perivascular spaces of the CNS behindthe BBB but do not gain access to the CNS parenchyma. Trapping of CNSinflammatory cells was not due to increased inflammatory cell proliferation.Neither a loss of BBB integrity or BBB polarity potentially affecting localchemokine gradients nor a lack of focal gelatinase activation required for CNSparenchymal immune cell entry across the glia limitans could be detected inJAM-B-/- mice. Lack of a role for JAM-B in the effector phase of EAE wassupported by the observation that we did not detect any role for JAM-B in EAEpathogenesis, when EAE was elicited by in vitro activated MOG aa35-55-specificCD4+ effector T cells. On the other hand, we also failed to demonstrate any role of JAM-B in in vivo priming, proliferation or polarization of MOGaa35-55-specificCD4+ T cells in peripheral immune organs. Finally, our study excludes expression of and thus a role for JAM-B on peripheral and CNS infiltrating myeloid cells.Taken together, although endothelial JAM-B is not required for immune celltrafficking across the BBB in EAE, in its absence accumulation of inflammatorycells mainly in CNS leptomeningeal spaces leads to amelioration of EAE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Cell- and stage-specific localization of galectin-3, a ë_-galactoside-binding lectin, in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.",/pubmed/29920290,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic T cells playan important role, and an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is usedas an animal model of MS. Galectins are _-galactoside-binding lectins andinvolved in various physiological and pathological events. Among fifteen members of galectins, galectin-1, -8, and -9 play immunosuppressive roles in MS and EAE; however, the role of galectin-3 (gal-3) is complex and controversial. We examinedexpression of gal-3 in the spinal cord and nerve roots of EAE mice. Noimmunohistochemical signals were detected in nave mice, whereas gal-3 appearedat lower lumbar levels of the spinal cord and nerve roots in EAE mice. In thespinal cord, gal-3-positive cells were activated microglia and/or infiltratingmacrophages, which were round in shape and intensified for the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D, indicating elevated phagocytic activity. Gal-3-positive cells in thespinal cord were most abundant during the peak symptomatic period. In therecovery period, they disappeared from the spinal parenchyma but remained atmoderate levels in the pia mater. Interestingly, gal-3-positive cells selectivelyappeared in ventral, but not dorsal, nerve roots running through the spinalcanal, with expression peaking during the recovery period. In ventral nerveroots, the major cell type expressing gal-3 was a specific population of Schwann cells that surround unmyelinated axons and express the biosynthetic enzyme forl-serine, a potent neurotrophic amino acid. Gal-3 was also induced inIba1/F4/80-positive macrophages, which engulf damaged myelin and axon debris.Thus, gal-3 is induced in distinct cell types that are engaged in removal ofdamaged axons and cell debris and axon regeneration and remyelination, suggestinga potential neuroprotective role of gal-3 in EAE mice.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Catheterization for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review. A report from the Neuro-Urology Promotion Committee of the International Continence Society (ICS).,/pubmed/29917273,"AIM: To systematically assess all available evidence on efficacy and safety ofcatheterization for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD)in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Studies were identified by electronic search of Embase, Medline, Scopus, Cochraneregister (last search March 3, 2018) and by screening of reference lists andreviews.RESULTS: After screening 7'015 articles, we included four studies (oneprospective and two retrospective cohort studies, one retrospectivecross-sectional study), in which a total of 445 patients were enrolled. Norandomized controlled trial was available. Catheterization substantiallyincreased quality of life, post void residual, and incontinence episodes in allincluded studies. Pooling of data for meta-analysis was not possible due to theheterogeneity of reported outcomes. Adverse events were reported in two studiesonly. Risk of bias and confounding was intermediate.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggests beneficial effects of catheterization onthe urological outcome in patients with MS. However, although intermittent andindwelling catheterization is used frequently in daily clinical practice in theMS population, the evidence base is very limited and well-designed, properlysampled, and powered studies are urgently needed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Glomerular Filtration Rate in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation and Treated With Cyclophosphamide.,/pubmed/29917152,"Background: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is partially impaired in patientswith multiple sclerosis (MS). When given chemotherapy before receivinghematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, GFR might be further deteriorated.Objective: To measure the effect of cyclophosphamide on GFR in patients with MSwho undergo chemotherapy.Methods: We estimated GFR based on creatinine and cystatin C plasmaconcentrations in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem-celltransplantation to treat their MS.Results: Baseline GFR values were lower in the 28 patients with MS than in the 20healthy individuals. Also, according to the Chronic Kidney Disease-EpidemiologyCollaborative Group (CKD-EPI) 2012 Creat-CysC equation criteria, 4 of 28 patientswere classified as having chronic kidney disease (CKD) before receiving thechemotherapy drugs. After receiving 4 _ 50 mg per kg body weightcyclophosphamide, abnormal GFR results were recorded in 12 of 28 patients.Conclusions: Renal function must be monitored in patients with MS undergoingautologous stem-cell transplantation. Also, chemotherapy should be constrained asmuch as possible to prevent further deterioration of renal function.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Commentary on Al Hussona et al.

Al Hussona et al., with their case series, highlight thecomplexities of attributing paroxysmal, and in particular cortical, symptoms suchas epileptic seizures to inflammatory demyelinating lesions, and establishing adiagnosis of MS based on them. In such circumstances an MS diagnosis is likely tobe more tentative than for more typical MS presentations, and treatment choicesshould be weighed accordingly.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulated MicroRNA Involvement in Multiple Sclerosis by Induction of T Helper 17 Cell Differentiation.,/pubmed/29915595,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of thecentral nervous system. Growing evidence has proven that T helper 17 (Th17) cellsare one of the regulators of neuroinflammation mechanisms in MS disease.Researchers have demonstrated that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated withdisease activity and duration, even with different MS patterns. miRNAs regulateCD4+ T cells to differentiate toward various T cell subtypes includingTh17_cells. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of miRNAs in MSpathophysiology by regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th17_cells, andpotential miRNA targets for current disease-modifying treatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"IL-3 Is a Marker of Encephalitogenic T Cells, but Not Essential for CNS Autoimmunity.",/pubmed/29915594,"Identifying molecules that are differentially expressed in encephalitogenic Tcells is critical to the development of novel and specific therapies for multiplesclerosis (MS). In this study, IL-3 was identified as a molecule highly expressedin encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17_cells, but not in myelin-specificnon-encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17_cells. However, B10.PL IL-3-deficient miceremained susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Furthermore, B10.PL myelin-specific T cell receptor transgenicIL-3-/- Th1 and Th17_cells were capable of transferring EAE to wild-type mice.Antibody neutralization of IL-3 produced by encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17_cellsfailed to alter their ability to transfer EAE. Thus, IL-3 is highly expressed in myelin-specific T cells capable of inducing EAE compared to activated,non-encephalitogenic myelin-specific T cells. However, loss of IL-3 inencephalitogenic T cells does not reduce their pathogenicity, indicating thatIL-3 is a marker of encephalitogenic T cells, but not a critical element in theirpathogenic capacity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Detection of Glycan Shedding in the Blood: New Class of Multiple Sclerosis Biomarkers?,/pubmed/29915593,"Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune disease,afflicting people in the prime of their lives. Presently, after initial clinical presentation, there are no reliable markers for whether a patient will developMS, or whether their prognosis will be aggressive or relapsing-remitting.Furthermore, many MS patients do not respond to treatment. Thus, markers fordiagnosis, prognosis, and treatment-responsiveness are lacking for a disease,where a precision medicine approach would be valuable. The glycocalyx (GLX) isthe carbohydrate-rich outer surface of the blood vessel wall and is the firstinteraction between the blood and the vessel. We hypothesized that cleavage ofthe GLX may be an early stage predictor of immune attack, blood-brain barrier(BBB) breakdown, and disease severity in MS.Methods: Two experimental models of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalitis(EAE), were included in this study. EAE was induced in C57BL/6J mice and Lewisrats, which were monitored for weight loss and clinical presentation incomparison to healthy controls. Plasma samples were obtained longitudinally from mice until peak disease severity and at peak disease severity in rats. SolubleGLX-associated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and proteoglycans (PG) were detected inplasma samples.Results: All animals receiving EAE emulsion developed fulminant EAE (100%penetrance). Increased plasma levels of chondroitin sulfate were detected before the onset of clinical symptoms and remained elevated at peak disease severity.Hyaluronic acid was increased at the height of the disease, whereas heparansulfate was transiently increased during early stages only. By contrast,syndecans 1, 3, and 4 were detected in EAE samples as well as healthy controls,with no significant differences between the two groups.Discussion: In this study, we present data supporting the shedding of the GLX as a new class of biomarker for MS. In particular, soluble, sugar-based GLXcomponents are associated with disease severity in two models of MS, moleculesthat would not be detected in proteomics-based screens of MS patient samples.Patient studies are presently underway.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Profiling of Canonical and Non-Traditional Cytokine Levels in Interferon-ë_-Treated Relapsing-Remitting-Multiple Sclerosis Patients.,/pubmed/29915590,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which inflammation plays a key role in theinduction, development, and progression. Most of the MS patients present withrelapsing-remitting (RR) form, characterized by flare-ups followed by periods of recovery. Many inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been proposed asbackers in MS pathogenesis, and the balance between these differing cytokines canregulate MS severity. Interferon (IFN)-_, a current disease-modifying therapy forMS, has demonstrated beneficial effects in reducing disease severity in MSpatients. However, its immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory actions in MS arenot wholly understood. The aim of the study was to define, in clinically stablepatients with RR-MS, the serum concentration of several cytokines, canonical ornot, and their modulation by IFN-_ therapy.Methods: Relapsing-remitting-MS patients were enrolled and diagnosed according torevised Mc Donald Diagnostic Criteria. A set of cytokines [includingnon-canonical neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and adipokines] and B-celldifferentiation molecules, as potential biomarkers, were evaluated in 30non-treated RR-MS patients compared to 30 IFN-_-treated MS patients and 30 age,gender, and body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC).Results: Nave MS patients showed significantly higher levels of interleukin(IL)-1_, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-18, high-mobility group box protein-1, and IL-18binding protein (IL-18BP) than MS-treated patients (p_<_0.001 for all) and HC(p_<_0.01). IFN-_ therapy has significantly downmodulated IL-1_, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-18 to normal levels (p_<_0.001), whereas it has decreased IL-18BP (p_<_0.001).ACh was significantly higher in the IFN-_-treated than HC and non-treated MSpatients (p_<_0.001). No significant differences were observed either inadipokines concentration or in B-cell-associated molecules among the three study groups.Conclusion: Although more experimental evidence are required, we speculate thatthe efficacy of treatment of MS with IFN-_ is mediated, at least in part, by its ability to work on several levels to slow down the disease progression. Proposed actions include the modulation of IL-1-inflammasome axis and modulation of ACh,B-cell activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand system, and severaladipokines.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Metabolomic Profiles for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Stratification and Disease Course Monitoring.,/pubmed/29915533,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) shows a highly variable diseaseprogression with poor prognosis and a characteristic accumulation of disabilitiesin patients. These hallmarks of PPMS make it difficult to diagnose and currently impossible to efficiently treat. This study aimed to identify plasma metaboliteprofiles that allow diagnosis of PPMS and its differentiation from therelapsing-remitting subtype (RRMS), primary neurodegenerative disease(Parkinson's disease, PD), and healthy controls (HCs) and that significantlychange during the disease course and could serve as surrogate markers of multiplesclerosis (MS)-associated neurodegeneration over time. We applied untargetedhigh-resolution metabolomics to plasma samples to identify PPMS-specificsignatures, validated our findings in independent sex- and age-matched PPMS andHC cohorts and built discriminatory models by partial least square discriminantanalysis (PLS-DA). This signature was compared to sex- and age-matched RRMSpatients, to patients with PD and HC. Finally, we investigated these metabolites in a longitudinal cohort of PPMS patients over a 24-month period. PLS-DA yielded predictive models for classification along with a set of 20 PPMS-specificinformative metabolite markers. These metabolites suggest disease-specificalterations in glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid pathways. Notably, theglycerophospholipid LysoPC(20:0) significantly decreased during the observationperiod. These findings show potential for diagnosis and disease coursemonitoring, and might serve as biomarkers to assess treatment efficacy in future clinical trials for neuroprotective MS therapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Transcranial direct current stimulation: A glimmer of hope for multiple sclerosis fatigue?,/pubmed/29914773,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease of the central nervous systemcharacterized by inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration. Throughoutthe disease process, patients may complain of a panel of sensory, motor,cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Fatigue is a debilitating manifestation ofcentral nervous system diseases with physical, cognitive and psychosocialdimensions. In MS, fatigue could be very frequent concerning up to 90% ofpatients and may have a drastic impact on their quality of life. Based onneuroimaging studies, a 'cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical' loop seems to underliethis symptom. Despite the availability of pharmacological molecules, the majorityof them fail to bring satisfactory outcomes mainly because of the numerousrelated side-effects. Therefore, finding a safe, easy to implement, and effectivealternative therapy is highly needed. These properties appear to match those ofnoninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct currentstimulation (tDCS). tDCS consists of placing two electrodes over cortical sites, such as those that take part in MS fatigue loop. Here, tDCS protocols targetingMS fatigue are revisited. Their short and long-term effects are discussed. Themajority of the available protocols have applied 5 consecutive daily 20-minsessions of anodal tDCS over specific cortical sites and yielded beneficialeffects on MS fatigue. Finally, the recent emergence of remotely supervised tDCS protocols are also tackled in this work aiming to address the future possibility of translating the current research data into routine clinical practice. This maylead to optimize patients' care and improve their quality of life.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Environmental exposures and the risk of multiple sclerosis in Saudi Arabia.,/pubmed/29914402,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-traumatic conditionthat leads to disability among young individuals. It is associated withdemyelination, inflammation, and neurodegeneration within the central nervoussystem. Information on risk factors of multiple sclerosis is crucial for theprevention and control of the disease. The aim of this study was to determinerisk factors of MS among adults in Saudi Arabia.METHODS: A matched multicenter case-control study, including 307 MS patients and 307 healthy controls, was conducted in MS clinics and wards in 3 main cities ofSaudi Arabia. Age, gender, and hospital were matched. Information ondemographics, family history of MS, past medical and family history, sun exposureat different age periods, tobacco use, diet, consanguinity, and coffeeconsumption was obtained from self-administered questionnaires. ORs and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A conditional logistic regressionmodel was used to control for potential confounding factors.RESULTS: The conditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender showedthat being the first child in the family (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.68, 95% CI:1.03-2.74), having a family history of MS (AOR 5.83, 95% CI: 2.83-12), eatingfast food ³5 times weekly (AOR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.03-4.08), and having had measles(AOR 3.77, 95% CI: 2.05-6.96), were independently associated with an increasedrisk of MS. In contrast, eating ³5 servings of fruit per week (AOR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.16-0.38), drinking coffee daily (AOR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.68), and having ahigh level of sun exposure at the primary school level and university level (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38-0.85 and AOR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.76, respectively) wereindependently associated with a decreased risk of MS.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that high levels of sun exposure during primary school and university, consumption of fruits and drinking coffee protect against MS. In contrast, eating fast food was associated with an increased risk of thedisease. Encouraging outdoor activity and healthy diets in school, especially forfemales, is highly recommended.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Emerging Cellular and Molecular Strategies for Enhancing Central Nervous System (CNS) Remyelination.,/pubmed/29914096,"Myelination is critical for the normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) in vertebrates. Conditions in which the development of myelin is perturbed result in severely compromised individuals often with shorter lifespans, whileloss of myelin in the adult results in a variety of functional deficits. Althoughsome form of spontaneous remyelination often takes place, the repair process as awhole often fails. Several lines of evidence suggest it is feasible to developstrategies that enhance the capacity of the CNS to undergo remyelination andpotentially reverse functional deficits. Such strategies include cellulartherapies using either neural or mesenchymal stem cells as well as molecularregulators of oligodendrocyte development and differentiation. Given theprevalence of demyelinating diseases and their effects on the quality of life foraffected individuals it is imperative that effective therapies are developed.Here we discuss some of the new approaches to CNS myelin repair that hold promisefor reducing the burden of diseases characterized by myelin loss.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 0.9. We observedsimilar patterns when we measured incidence over the entire follow-up period.

Thesefunctioning tumors include, insulinomas, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas,gastrinomas, VIPomas, serotonin-producing tumors, and ACTH-producing tumors.Although most panNENs arise as sporadic diseases, a subset of these heterogeneoustumors present as parts on inherited genetic syndromes, such as multipleendocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberoussclerosis, and glucagon cell hyperplasia and neoplasia syndromes. Characteristic clinical and morphologic findings for certain functioning and syndromic panNENsshould alert both pathologists and clinicians as appropriate patient managementand possible genetic counseling may be necessary.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cost-minimization analysis of alemtuzumab compared to fingolimod and natalizumab for the treatment of active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the Netherlands.,/pubmed/29911917,"AIM: In active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients requiringsecond-line treatment, the Dutch National Health Care Institute (ZiN) has notstated a preference for either alemtuzumab, fingolimod or natalizumab. Our aimwas to give healthcare decision-makers insight into the differences in costaccumulation over time between alemtuzumab - with a unique, non-continuoustreatment schedule - and fingolimod and natalizumab for second-line treatment of active RRMS patients in the Netherlands.METHODS: In line with ZiN's assessment, a cost-minimization analysis wasperformed from a Dutch healthcare perspective over a 5-year time horizon.Resource use was derived from hospital protocols and summaries of productcharacteristics, and validated by two MS specialists. Unit costs were based onnational tariffs and guidelines. Robustness of the base case results was verifiedwith multiple sensitivity and scenario analyses.RESULTS: Alemtuzumab results in cost savings compared to fingolimod andnatalizumab from respectively 3.3 and 2.8 years since treatment initiationonwards. At 5 years, total discounted costs per patient of alemtuzumab wereÛ79,717, followed by fingolimod with Û110,044 and natalizumab with Û122,238,resulting in cost savings of Û30,327 and Û42,522 for alemtuzumab compared tofingolimod and natalizumab, respectively. Key drivers of the model are drugacquisition costs and the proportions of patients that do not require furtheralemtuzumab treatment after either 2 or 3 or 4 courses.LIMITATIONS: No treatment discontinuation and associated switching betweentreatments were incorporated. Consequences of JC virus seropositivity whilecontinuing natalizumab treatment (e.g. additional monitoring), were omitted from the base case.CONCLUSION: The current cost-minimization analysis demonstrates that, from theDutch healthcare perspective, treating active RRMS patients with alemtuzumabresults in cost savings compared to second-line alternatives fingolimod andnatalizumab from approximately 3 years since treatment initiation onwards. After 5 years, alemtuzumab's cost savings are estimated at Û30k compared to fingolimod and Û43k compared to natalizumab.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Involvement of the Amygdala in Memory and Psychosocial Functioning in Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis.,/pubmed/29911891,"Youth with multiple sclerosis (MS) often experience cognitive impairment andpsychosocial disturbances. We describe the relationship between memory function, psychosocial skills, and brain volume in 32 patients with pediatric-onset MS and 30 controls. Amygdala volume was significantly lower in patients compared withcontrols. In general, poorer memory was associated with reduced functionalcommunication skills and reduced amygdala volume. Greater amygdala volume inpatients correlated with parent-reported functional communication and socialskills. Adjusting for whole-brain volume, right amygdala volume was positivelyassociated with visual memory; left amygdala volume was a stronger predictor ofparent-reported social skills.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Adherence in Youth With Multiple Sclerosis: A Qualitative Assessment of Habit Formation, Barriers, and Facilitators.",/pubmed/29911511,"Rates of medication nonadherence in youth with multiple sclerosis (MS) range from10% to 60%. Qualitative studies of adherence can provide insight into children's own perspectives about barriers and facilitators to their adherence and informfuture interventions. This qualitative longitudinal descriptive study includedchildren with MS ( n = 28) participating in a randomized controlled trial focusedon medication adherence ( clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02234713). Followingestablished methods, three independent reviewers coded transcripts ofmotivational interviewing (MI) sessions (three interviews per subject, performed monthly over a 3-month period) for relevant themes. They were subsequentlycategorized using inductive content analysis. Youth described medicationadherence as being dependent on the ability to build and maintain healthy habits related to medication use, including embodiment of these habits. Barriers andfacilitators included remembering/forgetting, experiences with fatigue, andexperiences with medication. These themes were maintained through the second and third interviews. Future research focus on barriers and facilitators to habitmaintenance in this population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Successful implementation of an automated electronic support system for patient safety monitoring: The alemtuzumab in multiple sclerosis safety systems (AMS3) study.,/pubmed/29911471,"BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a highly effective treatment for relapsing-remittingmultiple sclerosis (MS) but requires ongoing pathology monitoring for autoimmune adverse effects. The Alemtuzumab in MS Safety Systems (AMS3) study evaluated the implementation of an automated pathology-monitoring system.OBJECTIVES: To develop an efficient automated clinical decision support system(CDSS) to electronically prompt and track pathology collection and to provideprescribers and patients with customised alerts of abnormal results foridentified risks.METHODS: A total of 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated withalemtuzumab were enrolled to test the system. Standard care laboratory monitoringwas performed and compared to the performance of the CDSS.RESULTS: The automated CDSS, an integrated patient smartphone application and an additional pre-screening tool were all successfully developed. Compliance withpathology monitoring was 96.7%. The automated analysis of pathology results wassignificantly faster than standard care neurologist review ( p_<_0.001). Thesystem correctly identified and alerted abnormalities, including one case ofimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) while the treating neurologist was on leave,enabling prompt treatment of serious adverse events. During the course of thestudy, the CDSS was deployed throughout Australia.CONCLUSION: We successfully developed automated pathology monitoring with a CDSS,demonstrating real-world benefits of high compliance and timely alerting ofimportant results.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Estimating MS-related work productivity loss and factors associated with work productivity loss in a representative Australian sample of people with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29911469,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the work productivity loss in multiplesclerosis (MS).OBJECTIVES: To quantify the MS-related work productivity loss and to comparefactors associated with labour force participation and work productivity loss.METHODS: Participants were from the Australian MS Longitudinal Study. MS-related work productivity loss included absenteeism (time missed from work) andpresenteeism (reduced productivity while working). Data were analysed usinglog-binomial and Cragg hurdle regression.RESULTS: Among 740 MS employees, 56% experienced any work productivity loss dueto MS in the past 4_ weeks. The mean total work productivity loss was 2.5_ days(14.2% lost productive time), absenteeism 0.6_ days (3.4%) and presenteeism 1.9_ days (10.8%)), leading to AU$6767 (US$4985, EUROÛ4578) loss per person annually. Multivariable analyses showed that work productivity was determined most stronglyby symptoms, particularly 'fatigue and cognitive symptoms' and 'pain and sensory symptoms', while older age, and lower education level were also predictive of notbeing in the labour force.CONCLUSION: MS-related presenteeism was three times higher than absenteeism,highlighting the importance of presenteeism being included in employmentoutcomes. The dominance of symptom severity as predictors of both workparticipation and productivity loss emphasises the need for improved managementof symptoms.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predicting risk of secondary progression in multiple sclerosis: A nomogram.,/pubmed/29911467,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed at designing a nomogram, a prediction tool, to predict theindividual's risk of conversion to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(SPMS) at the time of multiple sclerosis (MS) onset.METHODS: One derivation and three validation cohorts were established. Thederivation cohort included 8825 relapsing-onset MS patients in Sweden. A nomogramwas built based on a survival model with the best statistical fit and prediction accuracy. The nomogram was validated using data from 3967 patients in the BritishColumbia cohort, 176 patients in the ACROSS and 2355 patients inFREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II extension studies.RESULTS: Sex, calendar year of birth, first-recorded Expanded Disability StatusScale (EDSS) score, age at the first EDSS and age at disease onset showedsignificant predictive ability to estimate the risk of SPMS conversion at 10, 15 and 20_years. The nomogram reached 84% (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 83-85)internal and 77% (95% CI: 76-78), 77% (95% CI: 70-85) and 87% (95% CI: 84-89)external accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: The SPMS nomogram represents a much-needed complementary tooldesigned to assist in decision-making and patient counselling in the early phase of MS. The SPMS nomogram may improve outcomes by prompting timely and moreefficacious treatment for those with a worse prognosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Views of healthcare professionals on training for and delivery of a fatigue self-management program for persons with multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29911446,"PURPOSE: To explore the experiences and perspectives of the healthcareprofessionals who were trained to and delivered ""Minimise Fatigue, Maximise Life""(MFML), a patient-centered group-based fatigue self-management program forpersons with multiple sclerosis.METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study with semi-structured individualinterviews at two time points. Data were analyzed for themes. Six healthcareprofessional facilitators who were trained to and delivered ""Minimise Fatigue,Maximise Life"" participated in a first interview, and five in a second.Participants were all female, aged between 23 and 66_years old and eitheroccupational therapists or physiotherapists.RESULTS: Two themes were evident in the data. The first, ""Reciprocity,"" showedhow the healthcare professionals were trained to deliver MFML, then reciprocated in the program delivery as active participants, which then provided feelings ofpersonal reward and expansion of their usual practice. The second,""Enhancements,"" encompassed suggested directions for future training anddeliveries of the program.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that multidimensional patient centeredinterventions also benefit the healthcare professionals who provide them because it expands their practice. Healthcare professionals who recognize the benefits ofinnovative and patient-centered interventions, supports both the patients withwhom they work, and adds value to the health services they provide. Implications for rehabilitation Healthcare professionals who undergo training to facilitatedelivery of self-management programs, which are based in an empowerment model,report an enhancement or expansion of their traditional practice. Anempowerment-based program delivered in a group situation encourages andfacilitates people to draw on their own and peers' knowledge and expertise toproblem solve for self-management. Healthcare professional education shouldfacilitate the healthcare professional's learning, and ability and willingness toacknowledge the richness in knowledge and expertise held by their patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Focal and diffuse cervical spinal cord damage in patients with early relapsing-remitting MS: A multicentre magnetisation transfer ratio study.,/pubmed/29909771,"BACKGROUND: Studies including patients with well-established multiple sclerosis(MS) have shown a significant and disability-related reduction in the cervicalspinal cord (SC) magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR).OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to (1) assess whether MTR reduction is alreadymeasurable in the SC of patients with early relapsing-remitting multiplesclerosis (RRMS) and (2) describe its spatial distribution.METHODS: We included 60 patients with RRMS <12_ months and 34 age-matchedcontrols at five centres. Axial T2*w, sagittal T2w, sagittal phase-sensitiveinversion recovery (PSIR), 3DT1w, and axial magnetisation transfer (MT) imageswere acquired from C1 to C7. Lesions were manually labelled and mean MTR valuescomputed both for the whole SC and for normal-appearing SC in different regionsof interest.RESULTS: Mean whole SC MTR was significantly lower in patients than controls(33.7 vs 34.9_ pu, p_ =_ 0.00005), even after excluding lesions (33.9_ pu, p_ =_ 0.0003). We observed a greater mean reduction in MTR for vertebral levelsdisplaying the highest lesion loads (C2-C4). In the axial plane, we observed agreater mean MTR reduction at the SC periphery and barycentre.CONCLUSION: Cervical SC tissue damage measured using MTR is not restricted tomacroscopic lesions in patients with early RRMS and is not homogeneouslydistributed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Improvement in overactive bladder symptoms in patients using functional electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve for walking.,/pubmed/29909652,"OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation is used to improve walking speed andreduces falls in people with upper motor neurone foot-drop. Following anecdotalobservations of changes in bladder symptoms, an observational study was performedto explore this association further.DESIGN: A total of 47 consecutive patients attending for setup with functionalelectrical stimulation during a six-month period were asked to complete aquestionnaire assessing bladder symptoms (ICIQ-OAB (International Consultation onIncontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder)) at baseline and three_ monthsduring routine appointments.SUBJECTS: In all, 35 (75%) had multiple sclerosis and the other 12 subjects had atotal of 9 diagnoses including 3 with stroke. Other conditions included cerebral palsy, motor neurone disease, hereditary spastic paraparesis, meningioma andspinocerebellar ataxias.RESULTS: Improvement in overactive bladder symptoms was not significant in thewhole cohort, however, was significant in patients with multiple sclerosis ( n_=_ 35; mean change in ICIQ-OAB score 1.0, P_ =_ 0.043). Specifically, significantimprovements were seen in urgency and urge incontinence in multiple sclerosispatients. There was a significant negative correlation of moderate strengthwithin the multiple sclerosis cohort between baseline walking speed andsubsequent change in ICIQ-OAB score (correlation coefficient of r_ =_ -0.40, P_=_ 0.046). Thus, greater changes in bladder symptoms were seen with lowerbaseline walking speeds.CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory study suggest that functionalelectrical stimulation use does improve overactive bladder symptoms in peoplewith multiple sclerosis. Further exploration is needed to study this association and explore whether the mechanism is similar to that of percutaneous tibial nervestimulation, a recognized treatment for the overactive bladder.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Frailty and pre-frailty in middle-aged and older adults and its association with multimorbidity and mortality: a prospective analysis of 493Ûö737 UK Biobank participants.,/pubmed/29908859,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with older age and multimorbidity (two or more long-term conditions); however, little is known about its prevalence or effectson mortality in younger populations. This paper aims to examine the associationbetween frailty, multimorbidity, specific long-term conditions, and mortality in a middle-aged and older aged population.METHODS: Data were sourced from the UK Biobank. Frailty phenotype was based onfive criteria (weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, low physical activity,slow walking pace). Participants were deemed frail if they met at least threecriteria, pre-frail if they fulfilled one or two criteria, and not frail if nocriteria were met. Sociodemographic characteristics and long-term conditions wereexamined. The outcome was all-cause mortality, which was measured at a median of 7 years follow-up. Multinomial logistic regression compared sociodemographiccharacteristics and long-term conditions of frail or pre-frail participants with non-frail participants. Cox proportional hazards models examined associationsbetween frailty or pre-frailty and mortality. Results were stratified by agegroup (37-45, 45-55, 55-65, 65-73 years) and sex, and were adjusted formultimorbidity count, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, smoking status, and alcohol use.FINDINGS: 493_737 participants aged 37-73 years were included in the study, ofwhom 16_538 (3%) were considered frail, 185_360 (38%) pre-frail, and 291_839(59%) not frail. Frailty was significantly associated with multimorbidity(prevalence 18% [4435/25_338] in those with four or more long-term conditions;odds ratio [OR] 27á1, 95% CI 25á3-29á1) socioeconomic deprivation, smoking,obesity, and infrequent alcohol consumption. The top five long-term conditionsassociated with frailty were multiple sclerosis (OR 15á3; 99á75% CI 12á8-18á2);chronic fatigue syndrome (12á9; 11á1-15á0); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(5á6; 5á2-6á1); connective tissue disease (5á4; 5á0-5á8); and diabetes (5á0;4á7-5á2). Pre-frailty and frailty were significantly associated with mortalityfor all age strata in men and women (except in women aged 37-45 years) afteradjustment for confounders.INTERPRETATION: Efforts to identify, manage, and prevent frailty should includemiddle-aged individuals with multimorbidity, in whom frailty is significantlyassociated with mortality, even after adjustment for number of long-termconditions, sociodemographics, and lifestyle. Research, clinical guidelines, and health-care services must shift focus from single conditions to the requirements of increasingly complex patient populations.FUNDING: CSO Catalyst Grant and National Health Service Research for ScotlandCareer Research Fellowship.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Interactions between dietary inflammatory index, nutritional state and Multiple Sclerosis clinical condition.",/pubmed/29908680,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) consists of a tool thatassesses dietary inflammatory potential based on the assignment of aninflammatory score to a variety of nutrients, seasonings and bioactive compounds.Pro-inflammatory diets are associated to weight and abdominal fat excess. HighBody Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) seem to contribute to a worse prognosis in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Therefore, this study seeks toinvestigate the relation between anthropometric indexes and body adiposity withthe clinical condition and the Dietary Inflammatory Index of MS individuals.METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, analytical study that included 137 MSpatients residing in the Brazilian northeast. Through a structured questionnaire and medical records consultation, we collected data on demographics, nutritional state, arterial pressure, clinical and dietary variables. Clinical variablesincluded the MS type, number of pulse therapies and attack rate in the last twoyears, number of days of most recent pulse therapy and muscular strengthassessment scores (MRC) and most recent disability level (EDSS). The nutritional state was evaluated based on BMI, WC, waist-hip ratio (WHR), Body Roundness Index(BRI), Body Shape z score Index (ABSIz) and body fat percentage (%BF). The DIIwas calculated according to a validated methodology.RESULTS: The ABSIz presented a positive correlation with regards to the EDSSscore (rÊ=Ê0.294. pÊ=Ê0.001). WC and WHR presented a negative correlation inrelation to the number of pulse therapy days (rÊ=Ê-0.255. pÊ=Ê0.022 andrÊ=Ê-0.251. pÊ=Ê0.024). BMI and %BF were not correlated to clinical variables(pÊ>Ê0.05). The DII was positively correlated to the BMI in people withprogressive MS (rÊ=Ê0.556. pÊ=Ê0.025).CONCLUSIONS: The DII may interfere in the nutritional state of MS patients andthe nutritional state may affect disability levels but it is necessary toestablish which nutritional indicator can better predict the relation between DIIand the clinical condition of MS patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anxiety is common and independently associated with clinical features of epilepsy.,/pubmed/29908386,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess for independent association of anxiety symptoms with epilepsy localization and other epilepsy-related anddemographic factors in a large tertiary care adult epilepsy population.METHODS: Among 540 adults, anxiety was measured by the Symptom Checklist 90-R(SCL-90R) anxiety subscale, and detailed demographics, epilepsy localization, anddepression scores (SCL-90R) were collected. High anxiety was defined by SCL-90Ranxiety T-score_³_60. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was carried out toassess for independent association of high anxiety scores with demographic andclinical factors.RESULTS: High anxiety symptoms were present in 46.1% of participants (N_=_250).Focal or unknown epilepsy type and depression scores were independentlyassociated with high anxiety (adjusted odds ratios (OR): 2.89 (95% confidenceinterval [CI]_=_1.33-6.29, p_=_0.007) and 2.12 (95% CI_=_1.83-2.45, p_<_0.001),respectively; depression odds per 5-point increase in scale). Among the focalepilepsy subpopulation, mesial temporal sclerosis was also independentlyassociated with high anxiety, with adjusted OR: 2.12 (95% CI_=_1.11-4.04,p_=_0.023). Lower education, non-white race/ethnicity, Spanish native language,prior head trauma, antiseizure drug polytherapy, and left focus or bilateral foci(in focal epilepsy) were associated with high anxiety in simple logisticregression, but these associations were not independent. A total of 46individuals (18.4% of those with high anxiety) scored high for anxiety but notdepression. Only 26% of those with high anxiety symptoms were taking apotentially anxiolytic medication.CONCLUSION: Anxiety symptoms, often without concomitant depression, were highlyprevalent in this epilepsy sample and independently associated with focal/unknownepilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis. These results strongly support the value of screening specifically for anxiety in the epilepsy clinic, to direct patients to appropriate treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Genome sequencing uncovers phenocopies in primary progressive multiple sclerosis.,/pubmed/29908077,"OBJECTIVE: Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) causes accumulation ofneurologic disability from disease onset without clinical attacks typical ofrelapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). However, whether genetic variation influencesthe disease course remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether mutationscausative of neurologic disorders that share features with MS contribute to risk for developing PPMS.METHODS: We examined whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 38 PPMS and 81healthy subjects of European ancestry. We selected pathogenic variantsexclusively found in PPMS patients that cause monogenic neurologic disorders, andperformed two rounds of replication genotyping in 746 PPMS, 3049 RMS, and 1000healthy subjects. To refine our findings, we examined the burden of rare,potentially pathogenic mutations in 41 genes that cause hereditary spasticparaplegias (HSP) in PPMS (n=314), SPMS (n=587), RMS (n=2,248), and healthysubjects (n=987) genotyped using the MS replication chip.RESULTS: WGS and replication studies identified 3 pathogenic variants in PPMSpatients that cause neurologic disorders sharing features with MS: KIF5Ap.Ala361Val in Spastic Paraplegia 10, MLC1 p.Pro92Ser in MegalencephalicLeukodystrophy with Subcortical Cysts, and REEP1 c.606_+_43G>T in SpasticParaplegia 31. Moreover, we detected a significant enrichment of HSP-relatedmutations in PPMS patients compared to controls (RR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.27-2.98,p=0.002), as well as in SPMS patients compared to controls (RR=1.57, 95% CI:1.18-2.10, p=0.002). Importantly, this enrichment was not detected in RMS.INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that rare Mendelian genetic variants contribute to the risk for developing progressiveforms of multiple sclerosis.

Real-life persistence and tolerability with dimethyl fumarate.,/pubmed/29906666,"BACKGROUND: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been registered for the treatment ofrelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Differences in tolerabilitybetween multiple sclerosis clinics in patients treated with DMF has not beenexamined.AIM: We examined real-world tolerability to DMF, and also compared adherence databetween two MS clinics.METHODS: Adverse events (AE), discontinuation rates, and causes ofdiscontinuation were investigated.RESULTS: 253 patients participated in this retrospective study. In the totalcohort, 27.7% of the patients discontinued DMF. Higher rate of discontinuationwas associated with higher number of previous disease modifying treatments(p_<_0.001). Reasons for discontinuation were primarily flushing (15%) andgastrointestinal AEs (51%). Grade III lymphopenia was detected only in 6 cases(2.4%). We observed differences between the two clinics: discontinuation because of AEs was different (Odds ratio 6.13, 95% CI: 3.0-12.7, p_<_0.001), the meantreatment duration also differed (305.3_±_186.3_vs 140.5_±_114.4 days,p_<_0.001), and dissimilarities in adherence were mainly related to flushing,gastrointestinal AEs, and consideration of lymphopenia (p_<_0.0001). Betteradherence was associated with prospectively planned management ofgastrointestinal AEs and flushing.CONCLUSION: Adherence in real-life was similar to pivotal trials. Differences in discontinuation rates at two MS clinics underline importance of AE management.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Pathophysiological implications of actin-free Gc-globulin concentration changes in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid collected from patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.,/pubmed/29905407,"BACKGROUND: The extracellular actin scavenging system (EASS) is composed ofplasma Gc-globulin and gelsolin, and is responsible for the elimination of toxic actin from the bloodstream.OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the actin-free Gc-globulin concentrations in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from subjects withneurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS)as well as in a control group.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), wemeasured the actinfree Gc-globulin concentrations in blood plasma and CSFobtained from subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 20),amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n = 12), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 42),tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (n = 12), and from a control group (n = 20).RESULTS: The concentrations of free Gc-globulin in plasma collected from patientsdiagnosed with AD (509.6 ±87.6 mg/L) and ALS (455.5 ±99.8 mg/L) did not differsignificantly between each other, but were significantly higher compared to thereference group (311.7 ±87.5 mg/L) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.006, respectively) aswell as to MS (310.8 ±66.6 mg/L) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and TBE (256.7 ±76 mg/L) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.003, respectively). In CSF collected frompatients diagnosed with AD and ALS, the concentrations of free Gc-globulin were2.6 ±1.1 mg/L and 2.7 ±1.9 mg/L, respectively. They did not differ significantly between each other and were significantly higher compared to the reference group (1.5 ±0.9 mg/L) (p < 0.005 and p < 0.041, respectively). Interestingly, inpatients with AD, significantly higher values of Gcglobulin were detectedcompared to multiple sclerosis patients (1.7 ±0.9 mg/L) (p < 0.013).CONCLUSIONS: Higher concentrations of free Gc-globulin in blood plasma and CSFcollected from patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases may indicate a potential role of this protein in their pathogenesis, and represent a potentialtool for the diagnosis of CNS diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Rare variants and de novo variants in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis.,/pubmed/29904720,"Objective: We investigated the role of rare genetic variants and of de novovariants in the pathogenesis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related tohippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS).Methods: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in patients with MTLE-HS and their unaffected parents (trios). Genes or gene sets that were enriched withpredicted damaging rare variants in the patients as compared to populationcontrols were identified. Patients and their parents were compared to identifywhether the variants were de novo or inherited.Results: After quality control, WES data from 47 patients (26 female), including 23 complete trios, were available for analysis. Compared with populationcontrols, significant enrichment of rare variants was observed in SEC24B.Integration of gene set data describing neuronal functions and psychiatricdisorders showed enrichment signal on fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)targets. Twenty-one de novo variants were identified, with many known to causeneuropsychiatric disorders. The FMRP-targeted genes also carried more de novovariants. Inherited compound heterozygous and homozygous variants wereidentified.Conclusions: The genetic architecture underlying MTHE-HS is complex. Multiplegenes carrying de novo variants and rare variants among FMRP targets wereidentified, suggesting a pathogenic role. MTLE-HS and other neuropsychiatricdisorders may have shared biology.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis of the diagnostic pathway and delay in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Valencian Community.,/pubmed/29903394,"INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an insidious, clinicallyheterogeneous neurodegenerative disease associated with a diagnostic delay ofapproximately 12 months. No study conducted to date has analysed the diagnosticpathway in Spain.METHODS: We gathered data on variables related to the diagnostic pathway anddelay for patients diagnosed with ALS between October 2013 and July 2017.RESULTS: The study included 143 patients with ALS (57% men; 68% spinal onset).Patients were diagnosed in public centres in 86% of cases and in private centres in 14%.The mean diagnostic delay was 13.1 months (median 11.7). Patients wereexamined by neurologists a mean time of 7.9 months after symptom onset, withdiagnosis being made 5.2 months later. Half of all patients underwent unnecessarydiagnostic tests and multiple electrophysiological studies before diagnosis wasestablished. Diagnostic delay was longer in cases of spinal onset (P = .008) due to onset of the disease in the lower limbs. No differences were found between thepublic and private healthcare systems (P = .897).CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic delay in ALS in Spain is similar to that ofneighboring countries and seems to depend on disease-related factors, not on the healthcare system. Patients with lower-limb onset ALS constitute the greatestdiagnostic challenge. Misdiagnosis is frequent, and partly attributable to anincorrect approach or erroneous interpretation of electrophysiological studies.Specific training programmes for neurologists and general neurophysiologists and early referral to reference centers may help to reduce diagnostic delay.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Laquinimod protects the optic nerve and retina in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model.,/pubmed/29903027,"BACKGROUND: The oral immunomodulatory agent laquinimod is currently evaluated formultiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. Phase II and III studies demonstrated areduction of degenerative processes. In addition to anti-inflammatory effects,laquinimod might have neuroprotective properties, but its impact on the visualsystem, which is often affected by MS, is unknown. The aim of our study was toinvestigate potential protective effects of laquinimod on the optic nerve andretina in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model.METHODS: We induced EAE in C57/BL6 mice via MOG35-55 immunization. Animals weredivided into an untreated EAE group, three EAE groups receiving laquinimod (1, 5,or 25Êmg/kg daily), starting the day post-immunization, and a non-immunizedcontrol group. Thirty days post-immunization, scotopic electroretinograms werecarried out, and mice were sacrificed for histopathology (HE, LFB),immunohistochemistry (MBP, Iba1, Tmem119, F4/80, GFAP, vimentin, Brn-3a, cleaved caspase 3) of the optic nerve and retina, and retinal qRT-PCR analyses (Brn-3a,Iba1, Tmem119, AMWAP, CD68, GFAP). To evaluate the effect of a therapeuticapproach, EAE animals were treated with 25Êmg/kg laquinimod from day 16 when 60% of the animals had developed clinical signs of EAE.RESULTS: Laquinimod reduced neurological EAE symptoms and improved the neuronalelectrical output of the inner nuclear layer compared to untreated EAE mice.Furthermore, cellular infiltration, especially recruited phagocytes, anddemyelination in the optic nerve were reduced. Microglia were diminished in opticnerve and retina. Retinal macroglial signal was reduced under treatment, whereas in the optic nerve macroglia were not affected. Additionally, laquinimodpreserved retinal ganglion cells and reduced apoptosis. A later treatment withlaquinimod in a therapeutic approach led to a reduction of clinical signs and to an improved b-wave amplitude. However, no changes in cellular infiltration anddemyelination of the optic nerves were observed. Also, the number of retinalganglion cells remained unaltered.CONCLUSION: From our study, we deduce neuroprotective and anti-inflammatoryeffects of laquinimod on the optic nerve and retina in EAE mice, when animalswere treated before any clinical signs were noted. Given the fact that the visualsystem is frequently affected by MS, the agent might be an interesting subject offurther neuro-ophthalmic investigations.",N,,,,,,,,,,

"Rhythm, Tachycardia, Paroxysmal Supraventricular (PSVT).",/pubmed/29939521,"Atrioventricular node (AV) measures approximately 1 by 3 by 5Ê millimeters andsits within an anatomic region bordered anteriorly by septal tricuspid valveannulus, superiorly by the tendon of Todaro and posteriorly by the coronary sinusostium. This anatomic region is also commonly referred to as triangle of Koch. AVnode is a subendocardial structure located in the inferior-posterior rightatrium. The blood supply to the AV node is from the AV nodal branch of the right coronary arteryÊ (90%) or the left circumflex artery (10%) depending on right or left dominant blood supply to the heart. The first septal perforator of the left anterior descending artery also supplies blood to the AV node. Paroxysmalsupraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) accounts for intermittent episodes ofsupraventricular tachycardia with sudden onset and termination. PSVT is part ofthe narrow QRS complex tachycardias with a regular ventricular response incontrast to multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrialflutter. SVTs are classified based on the origin of the rhythm and whether therhythm is regular or irregular. Atrial in origin and regular rhythm: Sinustachycardia. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Sinoatrial nodal reentranttachycardia. Atrial flutter. Atrial fibrillation. Atrial in origin and irregular rhythm: Multifocal atrial tachycardia. Atrial flutter with variable block.

Analysis of Genes Involved in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: Comparisons of 'Trigger' and 'Substrate' Differences.,/pubmed/29940585,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent research has improved our understanding of the pulmonary vein and surrounding left atrial (LA-PV) junction and the left atrial appendage(LAA), which are considered the 'trigger' and 'substrate' in the development ofatrial fibrillation (AF), respectively. Herein, with the aim of identifying theunderlying potential genetic mechanisms, we compared differences in geneexpression between LA-PV junction and LAA specimens via bioinformatic analysis.METHODS: Microarray data of AF (GSE41177) were downloaded from the GeneExpression Omnibus database. In addition, linear models for microarray data limmapowers differential expression analyses and weighted correlation network analysis(WGCNA) were applied.RESULTS: From the differential expression analyses, 152 differentially expressed genes and hub genes, including LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP, wereidentified. Our analysis revealed that the maps of extracellular matrix(ECM)-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathways, and ventricularcardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis were significantly enriched. In addition, theWGCNA results showed high correlations between genes and related genetic clustersto external clinical characteristics. Maps of the ECM-receptor interactions,chemokine signaling pathways, and the cell cycle were significantly enriched inthe genes of corresponding modules and closely associated with AF duration, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular ejection function, respectively. Similarly,mapping of the TNF signaling pathway indicated significant association withgenetic traits of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: The ECM-receptor interaction as a possible central node ofcomparison between LA-PV and LAA samples reflected the special functional rolesof 'triggers' and 'substrates' and may be closely associated with AF duration.Furthermore, LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP genes may be implicatedin the occurrence and maintenance of AF through their interactions with eachother.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The presence of atrial fibrillation in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is predictive of mortality: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29938868,"INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as the most common arrhythmia andan independent risk factor for mortality. Recent studies suggest that AF isassociated with morbidity and mortality in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC).However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature have not beendone. We assessed the association between AF in patients with TTC and mortalityby a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis.METHODS: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE frominception to January 2018. Included studies were published prospective orretrospective cohort studies that compared all-cause mortality in TTC with AFversus without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects,generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratiosand 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Five studies from August 2008 to October 2017 were included in thismeta-analysis involving 2,321 subjects with TTC (243 with AF and 2,078 withoutAF). The presence of AF was associated with all-cause mortality (pooled oddsratioÊ=Ê2.19, 95% confidence interval: 1.57-3.06, pÊ<Ê0.001, I 2 Ê=Ê0%).CONCLUSION: Atrial fibrillation increased all-cause mortality by double amongpatients with TTC compared to without it.

Sleep Apnea Is a Risk Factor for Stroke and Vascular Dementia.,/pubmed/29938308,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review the cerebrovascular complicationsof sleep apnea (SA). SA is the major sleep disorder associated with stroke andvascular dementia.RECENT FINDINGS: Sleep apnea syndrome of moderate to severe intensity affects 17%of 50-70-year-old men and 9% of 50-70-year-old women, making SA a notorious andprevalent disorder. SA increases the risk of hypertension, stroke, myocardialinfarction, and atrial fibrillation (AF) and is closely linked to vasculardementia. In addition, SA may worsen the neurologic outcome in acute strokepatients and interferes with rehabilitation after stroke. Proper management of SAmay decrease the clinical impact of stroke risk factors, improve neurologicoutcome after stroke, and lessen the progression of subcortical ischemic vasculardisease. In this article, we will cover the most salient pathologies thatassociate SA and cerebrovascular pathology.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Gout and arrhythmias: In search for causation beyond association.,/pubmed/29937218,"Gout is a systemic disease, characterized by the formation and deposition ofcrystals in tissues (mainly in and around the joints) of individuals withelevated serum uric acid levels. Lately, a considerable number of reportsrelating elevated uric acid and/or gout with rhythm disorders, such as atrialfibrillation, have been published. This review summarizes evidence linking commonarrhythmias and hyperuricemia/gout and discusses questions or controversies that surround it. Overall, existing evidence may not be overwhelming, but stronglysuggests a positive correlation between uric acid levels and common rhythmdisorders. Needless to say that such a link - as a univariate association betweenthe two - is to be expected, given the extensive overlap of risk factors andcomorbidities of hyperuricemia/gout and arrhythmias. However, the observedassociations seem to persist - in most studies - after extensive adjustment forpotential confounders. Still, multivariable analyses of epidemiologicallycollected data cannot substitute for proof coming from basic and clinicalstudies. There is obviously a need for further basic research to establish acausal relationship between uric acid effects and arrhythmias, as well astranslational studies and clinical trials to investigate the therapeuticimplications of such a relationship. Simply put, we are fairly certain that thereis association, but proof of causation is what we are still in want of.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impact and treatment success of new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate development in the surgical intensive care unit.,/pubmed/29937018,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR; heartrateÊ>100) in noncardiac postoperative surgical patients is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice patterns of AFmanagement in a surgical intensive care unit to determine practices associatedwith rate and rhythm control and additional outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients (³18 y) admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) from June 2014 to June 2015 were retrospectively screened forthe development of new-onset AF with RVR. Demographics, hospital course,evaluation and treatment of AF with RVR, and outcome were evaluated and analyzed.RESULTS: Thousand seventy patients were admitted to the SICU during the studyperiod; 33 met inclusion criteria (3.1%). Twenty-six patients (79%) had rate and rhythm control within 48 h of AF with RVR onset. _-Blockers were the mostcommonly used initial medication (67%) but were successful at rate and rhythmcontrol in only 27% of patients (6/22). Amiodarone had the highest rate ofsuccess if used initially (5/6, 83%) and secondarily (11/13, 85%). Failure tocontrol rate and rhythm was associated with a greater likelihood of comorbidities(100% versus 57%; PÊ=Ê0.06).CONCLUSIONS: New-onset AF with RVR in the noncardiac postoperative patient isassociated with a high mortality (21%). Amiodarone is the most effectivetreatment for rate and rhythm control. Failure to establish rate and rhythmcontrol was associated with cardiac comorbidities. These results will help toform future algorithms for the treatment of AF with RVR in the SICU.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Theophylline is a rather forgotten medication;thus, intoxication is not usually considered among the etiologies of potentially treatable cardiologic emergencies, especially when its use is intentionallyconcealed.CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of identifying a comprehensivemedication history using all available sources of information as early aspossible in an emergency department presentation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Special issue frailty - frailty and atrial fibrillation: A systematic review.,/pubmed/29936074,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and its prevalenceincreases with age. There is a significant correlation between frailty, morbidityand mortality in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, but the relationbetween AF and frailty is still under debate. The aim of this study is tosystematically review evidence on the association between AF and frailty. Asystematic review of articles published between 02/01/2002 and 09/28/2017according to PRISMA recommendations was carried out. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant articles. 11 studies were included; onelongitudinal, 10 cross-sectional. Only 4 studies assessed the association offrailty with AF, while 7 studies were performed in a sample of participants with AF and did not provide any measure of association between these two conditions.The prevalence of frailty in AF patients ranged from 4.4%-75.4% while AFprevalence in the frail population ranged from 48.2%-75.4%. Selected studiesenrolled an overall sample of 9420 participants. Among them, 2803 participantswere diagnosed with AF and of these 1517 (54%) were frail and 1286 (46%) werepre-frail or robust. The four studies assessing the association of AF and frailtyprovided conflicting results. Evidence suggests that frailty is common in personswith AF. More research is needed to better assess the association of theseconditions and to identify the optimal therapeutic approach to AF in persons withfrailty.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Increase in white blood cell count is associated with the development of atrial fibrillation after an acute coronary syndrome.,/pubmed/29936044,"BACKGROUND: Evidence linking an elevated white blood cell count (WBCC), a marker of inflammation, to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) after an acutecoronary syndrome (ACS) is limited. We examined the association between WBCC athospital admission, and changes in WBCC during hospitalization, with thedevelopment of new-onset AF during hospitalization for an ACS.METHODS: Development of AF was based on typical ECG changes in a systematicreview of hospital medical records. Increase in WBCC was calculated as thedifference between maximal WBCC during hospitalization and WBCC at hospitaladmission. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for severalpotentially confounding demographic and clinical variables in examining theassociation between WBCC, and changes over time therein, with the occurrence ofAF.RESULTS: The median age of study patients (n_=_1325) was 60_years, 31.8% werewomen, and 80.1% were non-Hispanic whites. AF developed in 7.3% of patients with an ACS. Patients who developed AF, as compared with those who did not, had asimilar WBCC at admission, but a greater increase in WBCC during hospitalization (6.0___109_cell/L vs. 2.7___109 cell/L, p_<_0.001). After adjusting for severalpotentially confounding factors, an increase in WBCC was associated with thedevelopment of AF. This association was observed in patients with different ACSsubtypes, types of treatment received, and according to time of acute symptomonset.CONCLUSION: Increase in the WBCC during hospitalization for an ACS should befurther studied as a potentially simple predictor for new-onset AF in thesepatients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis for the primary predictive factor for the incidence of esophageal injury after ablation of atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29935765,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal injury (EI) is a serious complication that occurs aftercatheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF), however predictable factor of EIis unclear.METHODS: Among 308 patients who underwent AF ablation, upper gastrointestinaltract endoscopy was performed the next day after ablation to examine for EI. Todefine the primary factor that predicts EI, patients' characteristics, number andamount of radiofrequency energy applied to the posterior wall, ablationprocedure, and the shortest distance between esophagus and posterior left atrium measured on contrast computed tomography (SD-CT) were analyzed.RESULTS: EI was found in 27 patients (8.8%). There were no significantdifferences in the patient characteristics, number and amount of radiofrequencyenergy applied to posterior wall or ablation procedure between patients with(Injury Group) and without EI (Non-Injury Group). However, SD-CT in the InjuryGroup was significantly shorter than that in Non-Injury Group (2.3±0.6mm vs4.1±0.9mm, p<0.001). The area under a receiver operating characteristic curveusing SD-CT as a predictive marker in EI patients was 0.988 (p<0.001). When thecut-off value of SD-CT was set at 2.9mm, the sensitivity and specificity for EIdiagnosis were 92.3% and 96.8%, and the positive predictive value and negativepredictive value were 0.75 and 0.99, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: EI observed after catheter ablation of AF was closely associatedwith the SD-CT. Patients with SD-CT below 2.9mm have a potential risk of EI andthus must be strictly followed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Role and Outcome of Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/29934991,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with diminished cardiacfunction, and exercise tolerance.HYPOTHESIS: We sought to investigate the role of cardiac rehabilitation program(CR) in patients with AF.METHODS: The study included 2165 consecutive patients that participated in our CRprogram between the years 2009 - 2015. All were evaluated by a standard exercise stress test (EST) at baseline, and upon completion of at least 3 months oftraining. Participants were dichotomized according to baseline fitness and thedegree of functional improvement. The combined primary end point was cardiacrelated hospitalization or all-cause mortality.RESULTS: A total of 292 patients had history of AF, with a mean age of 68±9 yearsold, 76% of which were males. The median predicted baseline fitness of AFpatients was significantly lower compared to non-AF patients (103% vs 122%,p<0.001, respectively). Prominent improvement was achieved in the majority of thepatients in both groups (64% among AF patients and 63% among those without AF).Median improvement in fitness between stress tests was significantly higher inpatients with AF (124% vs. 110%, p <0.001, respectively). Among AF patients, highbaseline fitness was associated with a lower event rates (HR 0.40; 95%CI0.23-0.70; p=0.001). Moreover, prominent improvement during CR showed aprotective effect (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.69-0.99; p=0.04).CONCLUSION: In patients with AF participating in CR program, low fitness levelsat baseline EST are associated with increased risk of total mortality orcardiovascular hospitalization during long-term follow-up.

Impact of pacemaker longevity on expected device replacement rates: results from computer simulations based on a Multicenter Registry (ESSENTIAL).,/pubmed/29934948,"AIMS: We estimated the probability of device replacement in an unselectedpopulation of pacemaker recipients, with automatic management of atrial andventricular pacing output.METHODS: We considered a cohort of 542 pacemaker patients (age 78±9 years, 60%male, 71% de-novo implants) and combined 1-month projected device longevity with survival data and late complication rate in a 3-state Markov model tested inseveral Monte Carlo computer simulations. Predetermined subgroups were: age < or ³ 70; gender; primary indication to cardiac pacing.RESULTS: At the 1-month follow-up the reported projected device longevity was153±45 months. With these values the proportion of patients expected to undergo adevice replacement due to battery depletion was higher in patients aged <7049.9%, range 32.1%-61.9%) than in age ³70 (24.5%,19.9%-28.8%); in women (39.9%,(30.8%-48.1%) than in men (32.0%,24.7%-37.5%); in sinus node dysfunction (41.5%30.2%-53.0%) than in atrio-ventricular block (33.5%, 27.1-38.8%) or atrialfibrillation with bradycardia (27.9%, 18.5%-37.0%). The expected replacement ratewas inversely related to the assumed device longevity and depended on age class: a 50% increase in battery longevity implied a 5% reduction of replacement ratesin patients aged ³80.CONCLUSIONS: With current device technology 1/4 of pacemaker recipients aged ³70 are expected to receive a second device in their life. Replacement rate dependson age, gender and primary indication owing to differences in patients' survival expectancy. Additional improvements in device service time may modestly impactexpected replacement rates especially in patients ³80 years. This article isprotected by copyright.

Heart Failure After Ischemic Stroke or TIA in Insulin-Resistant Patients Without Diabetes Treated with Pioglitazone.,/pubmed/29934374,"Background -The Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trialdemonstrated that pioglitazone reduced risk for both cardiovascular events anddiabetes in insulin resistant patients. However, concern remains thatpioglitazone may increase risk for heart failure (HF) in susceptible individuals.Methods -In IRIS, patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes wererandomized to pioglitazone or placebo (1:1) within 180 days of an ischemic strokeor TIA and followed for up to 5 years. To identify patients at higher HF riskwith pioglitazone we performed a secondary analysis of IRIS participants without HF history at entry. HF episodes were adjudicated by an external review andtreatment effects were analyzed using time-to-event methods. A baseline HF riskscore was constructed from a Cox model estimated using stepwise selection.Baseline patient features (individually and summarized in risk score) andpost-randomization events were examined as possible modifiers of the effect ofpioglitazone. Net cardiovascular benefit was estimated for the composite ofstroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and hospitalized HF. Results -Among 3851patients, mean age was 63 years and 65% were male. The 5-year HF risk did notdiffer by treatment (4.1% pioglitazone; 4.2% placebo). Risk for hospitalized HFwas low and not significantly greater in pioglitazone compared to placebo groups (2.9% vs. 2.3%, p=0.36). Older age, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, obesity,edema, high C-reactive protein, and smoking were risk factors for HF. However,the effect of pioglitazone did not differ across levels of baseline HF risk(hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for pioglitazone vs. placebo for patientsat low, moderate and high risk: 1.03 [0.61, 1.73], 1.10 [0.56, 2.15], 1.08 [0.58,2.01]; interaction p-value, 0.98). HF risk was increased in patients with vs.those without incident MI in both groups (pioglitazone: 31.4% vs. 2.7%; placebo: 25.7% vs. 2.4%, p<0.0001). Edema, dyspnea and weight gain in the trial did notpredict HF hospitalization, but led to more study drug dose reduction with alower mean dose of pioglitazone vs. placebo (29±17 mg vs. 33±15 mg; p<0.0001).Pioglitazone reduced the composite outcome of stroke, MI or hospitalized HF (HR, 0.78; p=0.007). Conclusions -In IRIS, with surveillance and dose adjustments,pioglitazone did not increase risk of HF, and conferred net cardiovascularbenefit in patients with insulin resistance and cerebrovascular disease. The riskof HF with pioglitazone was not modified by baseline HF risk. The IRIS experiencemay be instructive for maximizing the net benefit of this therapy.

The studyobjectives were to compare effectiveness and safety of DOACs in patients withnon-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).METHODS: Based on nationwide registers we established a population-basedhistorical cohort study of 12,638 new users of standard dose DOACs (apixaban 5_mgtwice daily, dabigatran 150_mg twice daily and rivaroxaban 20_mg once daily) withNVAF in Denmark, July 2013 to March 2016. Patients were matched on propensityscores in a 1:1 ratio comparing apixaban vs. dabigatran (for a total of 6470patients), apixaban vs. rivaroxaban (7352 patients), and rivaroxaban vs.dabigatran (5440 patients). Hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke or systemic embolism(effectiveness outcome) and major bleeding (safety outcome) were estimated.RESULTS: In propensity-matched comparisons of the risk of stroke or systemicembolism, the HRs were 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.96) forapixaban vs. dabigatran, 1.25 (95% CI, 0.87-1.79) for apixaban vs. rivaroxaban,and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.69-1.96) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran.

High-sensitivity troponin I in persistent atrial fibrillation - relation to NT-proBNP and markers of inflammation and haemostasis.,/pubmed/29933716,"PURPOSE: As cardiac troponins emerge as prognostic markers in atrial fibrillation(AF), it is important to identify mechanisms initiating and perpetuating cardiac troponin release, including its relations to other circulating biomarkers, in AF populations. We studied associations between high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI)and markers representing myocardial wall tension, inflammation and haemostasis inpersistent AF.METHODS: In a double blind, placebo-controlled study, 171 patients referred forelectrical cardioversion for persistent AF were randomised to receive candesartanor placebo for 3-6_weeks before and 6_months after cardioversion. Associationsbetween baseline levels of hs-TnI and other biomarkers were investigated bybivariate non-parametric correlations (Spearman's correlation coefficient denotedrs).RESULTS: Baseline levels of hs-TnI correlated significantly, although weakly,with interleukin-6 (rs_=_0.260, p_=_.003), N-terminal pro-B-type natriureticpeptide (rs_=_0.251, p_=_.004), tissue-plasminogen activator antigen (rs_=_0.233,p_=_.008), D-dimer (rs_=_0.220, p_=_.013), E-selectin (rs_=_0.207, p_=_.019),high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (rs_=_0.202, p_=_.022) and vascular celladhesion molecule-1 (rs_=_0.189, p_=_.032).CONCLUSIONS: Hs-TnI correlated weakly with biomarkers representing myocardialwall tension, inflammation and haemostasis in persistent AF.

In the absence of clearguidelines on the appropriate use of the newer non-vitamin K antagonist oralanticoagulants in this population, we specifically review the availableliterature for rivaroxaban and the impact of age that may affect thepharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of this anticoagulant.METHODS: This review includes a summary of data obtained from the availableliterature concerning both older healthy subjects and older patients with variousaspects of cardiovascular disease enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials anddata from real world evidence studies.RESULTS: Evaluation of the clinical pharmacology in healthy, older adults reveal no clinically relevant effect of age on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics. Population pharmacokinetic studies in older patients withthromboembolic diseases suggest a moderate effect of increasing age onrivaroxaban clearance, albeit not clinically significant. Additionally, subgroup analyses from large, phase 3 clinical trials demonstrate consistent efficacy and safety in the older patient population versus the overall population. Thesefindings are further supported by real-world evidence studies.CONCLUSION: A favorable clinical profile with rivaroxaban was observed across agesubgroups, supporting the premise that dosing in older adults does notnecessitate adjustment. However, it is prudent that a cautious and individualizedapproach is taken for treatment with any anticoagulant in older adults.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Enzymatic mediastinitis as a fearsome complication of pancreatic necrosectomy.,/pubmed/29931993,"Several types of thoracic complications can be associated with severe acutepancreatitis. Some are very common, such as pleural effusion, whilst some others are very rare although life threatening, such as enzymatic mediastinitis (EM).Only a few cases of EM (when related to acute pancreatitis) have been describedin the literature. Here we describe the case of a 76-year-old female whodeveloped acute respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation during thepostoperative period after an open pancreatic necrosectomy, due to an EM episode.The mediastinal collection was drained by thoracotomy, following an improvementof the patient's general condition. This is the first case of EM followingsurgical management for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. EM is a rare but lifethreatening complication that usually requires surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impact of high-grade Atrioventricular block and cumulative frequent pacing on atrial arrhythmias.,/pubmed/29931776,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between high-grade AV block (HGAVB) with cumulative frequent pacing and risk of atrial arrhythmias (AAs) has not been wellcharacterized. We hypothesized HGAVB and pacing may have significant impact onincidence and prevalence of AAs by modulating atrial substrate.OBJECTIVE: To determine impact of HGAVB and pacing on AAs including atrialfibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), and atrial tachycardia (AT).METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent dual chamber pacemakerimplantation for HGAVB from 2005 to 2011 at the University of Chicago wereincluded. AAs and percent of pacing were detected through device interrogation.Patients' data were collected from electronic medical records and clinic visits.RESULTS: A total of 166 patients (mean age 71±15 years; 54% female, 56%African-American) were studied. AF was documented in 27% of patients beforepacemaker implantation. During a mean 5.8±2.2 years of follow-up, 47% haddevice-detected AF, 10% AFL and 26% AT. New-onset AF was documented in 40 of the 122 patients without prior AF (33%). Continuous (³99%) right ventricular pacingwas associated with significantly decreased AF prevalence (34% versus 59%,pÊ=Ê0.005), and correlated with lower incidence (26% versus 41%, pÊ=Ê0.22).Pacing suppressed AF in 14% of patients with baseline AF; those patients hadlower atrial pacing (3.2% versus 45%, pÊ<Ê0.0001). Left atrial dilation was theonly independent predictor of AF with frequent pacing (pÊ=Ê0.009).CONCLUSIONS: HGAVB is associated with high incidence and prevalence of AAs withand without pacing. Cumulative frequent (³99%) ventricular pacing reduces risk ofAF in patients with HGAVB. This article is protected by copyright. All rightsreserved.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Body image concerns in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: A scoping review.,/pubmed/29931685,"BACKGROUND: Patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) retain a scar and a bump at the site of implant. This may lead to body image concerns(BICs) that influence patients' quality of life. Few studies have examined theprevalence and impact of BICs post implant, prompting us to conduct a scopingreview of the field.METHODS: We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Cinahl databases in August2016 and repeated May 2017. Included were studies reporting on patients ³ 18years, an ICD implant (transvenous, subcutaneous, or ICD with cardiacresynchronization therapy (CRT-D), reporting on BICs, and published inpeer-reviewed English-language journals. We excluded non-systematic reviews,opinion pieces/letters, case-studies, conference-abstracts, PhD-dissertations,protocol papers, studies of ICD shock treatment of atrial fibrillation and ofabdominally or submammary implanted ICDs.RESULTS: A total of 40 articles were included; 16 qualitative and 24quantitative. None of the included studies had BICs as their primary endpoint.Results showed that BICs are present in various degrees in the ICD population andcan be attributed to the visibility of the ICD (the scar and bump). Women andyounger patients had greater problems with BICs, although men also had concerns. Two items of the ""Florida Patient Acceptance Survey"" were the most frequentlyused to assess BICs.CONCLUSION: BICs were present among ICD patients, but the degree of impact ontheir lives varied. There is a need for developing a BICs questionnaire toexamine the prevalence of BICs and the potential impact on patients' lives inlongitudinal studies. This article is protected by copyright.

Arrhythmia care in Africa.,/pubmed/29931543,"Data on cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmias, in Africa is limited.However, the burden of cardiovascular disease appears to be on the rise. Recentglobal data suggests an increase in atrial fibrillation rates despite decliningrates of rheumatic heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is also associated withincreased mortality in Africa. Current management with medical therapy issub-optimal and ablation procedures, inaccessible. Atrial fibrillation is also anindependent risk factor for death in patients with rheumatic heart disease.Sudden cardiac deaths from ventricular arrhythmias are under-recognized andinadequately treated with very high rates out of hospital cardiac arrest due topoor education of the general public on cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills and lack of essential healthcare infrastructure. Use of cardiac devices such asimplantable defibrillators and pacemakers is low with significant regionalvariations and is almost non-existent in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a greatunmet need for arrhythmia diagnosis and management in Africa. Governments andhealthcare stakeholders need to include cardiovascular disease as a healthcarepriority given the rising burden of disease and associated mortality.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Asymptomatic Cerebral Infarction is a Predictor of Long-Term Survival and Vascular or Limb Events in Peripheral Arterial Disease.,/pubmed/29931172,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine long-term life expectancyincluding cerebrovascular events (CVE) and fate of the leg in patients withperipheral arterial disease (PAD) with or without cerebral infarction (CI)detected by CT.Methods and Results: A prospective cohort study was performed in 932 patientswith PAD. The endpoints were overall survival (OS); CVE; stroke-free survival(SFS); freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular and limb events (MACLE). The prevalence of CI on CT was 56.8%. There were 413 deaths (44.3%) during follow-up. The rate ofcardiovascular deaths among those who died was 53.5%. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates were 82.0%, 76.9%, and 46.2%, respectively. In Cox multivariate analyses,age, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), critical limb ischemia (CLI), estimatedglomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin level, and CI were independent factorsassociated with OS (p_<_0.05); age, ABI, CLI, atrial fibrillation (AF), and CIwere related to CVE (p_<_0.05); age, ABI, CLI, diabetes, coronary heart disease(CHD), AF, eGFR, lower albumin, and CI were related to SFS (p_<_0.05); age, ABI, CLI, diabetes, CHD, eGFR, lower albumin, and CI were associated with MACE(p_<_0.05); and age, ABI, diabetes, CHD, eGFR, lower albumin and CI were related to MACLE (p_<_0.05). Statins improved MACE and MACLE (p_<_0.05), and AF increasedMACLE (p_<_0.05).Conclusions: CI on CT was an independent predictor for mortality, CVE, SFS, MACE,and MACLE. Statins improved MACE and MACLE, but AF increased CVE and MACLE inpatients with PAD.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
The Transcription Factor ETV1 Induces Atrial Remodeling and Arrhythmia.,/pubmed/29930145,"Rationale: Structural and electrophysiological remodeling of the atria arerecognized consequences of sustained atrial arrhythmias, such as atrialfibrillation (AF). The identification of underlying key molecules and signalingpathways has been challenging due to the changing cell type composition duringstructural remodeling of the atria. Objective: Thus, the aims of our study were(1) to search for transcription factors and downstream target genes, which areinvolved in atrial structural remodeling, (2) to characterize the significance ofthe transcription factor ETV1 in atrial remodeling and arrhythmia and (3) toidentify ETV1-dependent gene regulatory networks in atrial cardiac myocytes.Methods and Results: The transcription factor ETV1 was significantly upregulated in atrial tissue from patients with permanent AF. Mice with cardiacmyocyte-specific overexpression of ETV1 under control of the myosin heavy chainpromoter developed atrial dilatation, fibrosis, thrombosis and arrhythmia.Cardiac myocyte-specific ablation of ETV1 in mice did not alter cardiac structureand function at baseline. Treatment with Ang II for two weeks elicited atrialremodeling and fibrosis in control, but not in ETV1-deficient mice. To identifyETV1-regulated genes, cardiac myocytes were isolated and purified from mouseatrial tissue. Active cis-regulatory elements in mouse atrial cardiac myocyteswere identified by chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and the active chromatinmodification H3K27ac (ChIP-seq). 178 genes regulated by Ang II in anETV1-dependent manner were associated with active cis-regulatory elementscontaining ETV1 binding sites. Various genes involved in Ca2+ handling or gapjunction formation (Ryr2, Jph2, Gja5), potassium channels (Kcnh2, Kcnk3) as well as genes implicated in AF (Tbx5) were part of this ETV1-driven gene regulatorynetwork. The atrial ETV1-dependent transcriptome in mice showed a significantoverlap with the human atrial proteome of patients with permanent AF.Conclusions: This study identifies ETV1 as an important component in thepathophysiology of atrial remodeling associated with atrial arrhythmias.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Value of high-resolution mapping in optimizing cryoballoon ablation of atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29929934,"BACKGROUND: Unrecognized incomplete pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), as opposed topost-PVI pulmonary vein reconnection, may be responsible for clinical recurrencesof atrial fibrillation (AF). To date, no data are available on the use ofhigh-resolution mapping (HRM) during cryoballoon (CB) ablation for AF as theindex procedure. The aims of this study were: - to assess the value of using aHRM system during CB ablation procedures in terms of ability in acutely detectingincomplete CB lesions; - to compare the 8-pole circular mapping catheter (CMC,Achieve) and the 64-pole mini-basket catheter (Orion) with respect to pulmonaryvein (PV) signals detection at baseline and after CB ablation; - to characterize the extension of the lesion produced by CB ablation by means of high-densityvoltage mapping.METHODS: Consecutive patients with drug-resistant paroxysmal or early-persistent AF undergoing CB ablation as the index procedure, assisted by a HRM system, were retrospectively included in this study.RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (25 males; mean age: 59_±_18_years, 28 paroxysmalAF) were included. At baseline, CMC catheter revealed PV activity in 102 PVs(77%), while the Orion documented PV signals in all veins (100%). Failure ofcomplete CB-PVI was more frequently revealed by atrial re-mapping with the Orion as compared to the Achieve catheter (24% vs 0%, p_<_0.05). A repeat ablation was performed in 8 patients (24%). In 9% of cases, the Orion catheter detectedfar-field signals originating from the right atrium. Quantitative assessment ofthe created lesion revealed a significant reduction of the left atrial areahaving voltage >0.5_mV. A total of 29 patients (88%) remained free of symptomaticAF during a mean follow-up of 13.2_±_3.7_months.CONCLUSION: Atrial re-mapping after CB ablation by means of a HRM system improvesthe detection of areas of incomplete ablation, characterizes the extension of thecryo-ablated tissue and can identify abolishment of potential non-PVI relatedsources of AF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of 28-mm Cryoballoon Ablation onåÊMajor Atrial Ganglionated Plexi.,/pubmed/29929678,"OBJECTIVES: The authors intended to investigate if 28-mm cryoballoon (CB)ablation also modifies the 4 major atrial ganglionaated plexi (GP).BACKGROUND: The major atrial GP facilitate the initiation and maintenance ofatrial fibrillation (AF). The 28-mm CB covers a large surface area of the leftatrium and probably the GP areas.METHODS: High-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) was delivered to the area of anteriorright GP (ARGP), inferior right GP, superior left (SLGP), and inferior left GP(ILGP). Positive GP sites were defined as a prolongation of R-wave to R-wave (RR)interval during AF by >50%. The area of each GP before and after CB ablation was compared.RESULTS: A total of 18 patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent CB andradiofrequency ablation and had positive GP sites were reviewed. The Wilcoxonsigned-rank test was used to assess the effects of CB ablation on each GP. There was a statistically significant difference in the area of all 4 GP after CBablation: 1) ARGP area: 2.9 cm2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.1 to 3.5 cm2)pre-CB, 0.1 cm2 (IQR: 0 to 0.6 cm2) post-CB, pÊ= 0.0002; 2) inferior right GParea: 2.1 cm2 (IQR: 0.9 to 2.9 cm2) pre-CB, 0.5 cm2 (IQR: 0 to 1.7 cm2) post-CB, pÊ= 0.001; 3) SLGP area: 1.4 cm2 (IQR: 0.6 to 2.4 cm2) pre-CB,Ê0Êcm2 (IQR: 0 to 0cm2) post-CB, pÊ= 0.0002; and 4) ILGP area: 1.3 cm2 (IQR: 0.3 to 2.2 cm2) pre-CB,0.3 cm2 (IQR: 0 to 1.6 cm2) post-CB, pÊ= 0.008.CONCLUSIONS: The surface area of all 4 of the major atrial GP was substantiallyreduced by CB ablation. The SLGP and ARGP had the largest, whereas the ILGP hadthe least percent of reduction following CB ablation. Part of the therapeuticeffects of CB ablation may result from modifying the 4 major atrial GP.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Updated Survey on Interventional Electrophysiology: 5-Year Follow-Up of Infrastructure, Procedures, and TrainingåÊPositions in Germany.",/pubmed/29929676,"OBJECTIVES: This study provides an update and comparison to a 2010 nationwidesurvey on cardiac electrophysiology (EP), types and numbers of interventionalelectrophysiological procedures, and training opportunities inÊ2015.BACKGROUND: In 2010, German cardiology centers performing interventional EP were identified and contacted to provide a survey on cardiac EP.METHODS: German cardiology centers performing interventional EP in 2015 wereidentified from quality reports and contacted to repeat the 2010 questionnaire.RESULTS: A majority of 131 centers (57%) responded. EP (ablation procedures anddevice therapy) was mainly part of a cardiology department (89%) and onlyindependent (with its own budget) in 11%. The proportion of female physicians in EP training increased from 26% in 2010 to 38% in 2015. In total, 49,356 catheter ablations (i.e., 81% of reported ablations in 2015) were performed by theresponding centers, resulting in a 44% increase compared with 2010 (theÊmediannumber increased from 180 to 297 per center). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was themost common arrhythmia interventionally treated (47%). At 66% of the centers, (atleast) 2 physicians were present during most catheter ablations. A minimum of 50 (75) AF ablations were performed at 80% (70%) of the centers. Pulmonary veinisolation with radiofrequency point-by-point ablation (62%) and cryoablation(33%) were the preferred ablation strategies. About one-third of centers reportedsurgical AF ablations, with 11 centers (8%) performing stand-alone surgical AFablations. Only one-third of the responding 131 centers fulfilled allrequirements for training center accreditation.CONCLUSIONS: Comparing 2010 with 2015, an increasing number of EP centers andprocedures in Germany are registered. In 2015, almost every second ablation wasfor therapy for AF. Thus, an increasing demand for catheter ablation is likely,but training opportunities are still limited, and most centers do not fulfilrecommended requirements for ablation centers.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-Term Follow-Up After Ablation of Intra-Atrial Re-Entrant Tachycardia in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease: Types and Predictors of Recurrence.,/pubmed/29929671,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term outcomes afterintra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia (IART) ablation in congenital heart disease(CHD).BACKGROUND: IART increases morbidity and mortality in CHD patients.Radiofrequency catheter ablation has evolved into the first-line treatment ofthis complication.METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center study of all consecutive CHDpatients who underwent first ablation for IART from January 2009 to December 2015(nÊ= 94, 39.4% female, age 36.55 ± 14.9 years, follow-up 44.45 ± 22.7 months).RESULTS: During the study period, 130 procedures were performed (nÊ= 94, 1.21 ±0.41 IART/patient). In the first procedure, 114 IART were ablated (short-termsuccess 74.66%). Forty-nine percent of the patients whose IART was ablated hadnon-cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-related IART (alone or with concomitant CTIIART). After the first ablation, 54.3% maintained sinus rhythm (SR), 23.9%presented with recurrence of the ablated IART, 14.2% developed new IART, and 7.6%presented with atrial fibrillation (AF). After the second radiofrequency catheterablation, 78.3% were in SR, 8.7% presented with AF, and 23.0% presented with IART(50% new IART). Multivariate predictors of recurrences were non-CTI IART (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 15.9; pÊ= 0.006), PRinterval >200 ms (HR: 4.02; 95% CI: 1.9 to 11.3; pÊ= 0.009), AF induction (HR:3.11; 95% CI: 1.1 to 9.1; pÊ= 0.04). and previous AF (HR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.1 to9.3; pÊ= 0.04). A risk score according multivariate model identified 3 levels of recurrence risk: 5.8%, 20%, and 58.5% (area under the receiver-operatingcharacteristic curve 0.8 ± 0.03; pÊ< 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Ablation of IART in CHD is a challenging procedure, but afterablation in experienced centers, SR can be maintained in 78.3%. Predictors ofrecurrences are non-CTI-related IART, long PR interval, and previous or inducedAF. AÊrisk score based on these factors can be useful for recurrence prediction.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Catheter Ablation for AtrialåÊFibrillationåÊinåÊAdults WithåÊCongenitalåÊHeart Disease: Lessons Learned From More Than 10 Years FollowingåÊaåÊSequential Ablation Approach.,/pubmed/29929666,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact, safety, and success ofatrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) transferring ablation strategies established in normal hearts.BACKGROUND: AF is an emerging arrhythmia in ACHD.METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive ACHD (median age 51.1 ± 14.8 years) withdrug-refractory AF were analyzed who underwent catheter ablation between 2004 and2017. CHD was classified according to its complexity into mild (61.4%), moderate (17.5%), and severe (21.1%) lesions. AF ablation was performed in 104 procedures following a sequential ablation approach.RESULTS: Of the 57 patients, 30 underwent corrective surgery, 6 underwentpalliative surgery, 5 had catheter interventions, and 16 were natural survivors. Follow-up was available for all patients (median 41 ± 36 months). ThemedianÊduration of cyanosis was 9.2 ± 19.7 years, and the time of volume orpressure overload prior to corrective surgery or intervention was 26.1 ± 21.2years and 18.1 ± 15.8 years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate forarrhythmia-free survival following the index ablation procedure was 63% for 1year and 22% for 5 years. Performing subsequent ablation procedures (2.0 ± 0.5), the Kaplan-Meier estimate significantly improved, with 99% for 1 year and 83% for5 years (pÊ<Ê0.01). Five patients died during follow-up due to their underlyingCHD condition or underwent transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: AF ablation strategies established in normal hearts can betransferred to ACHD. The treatment is safe and effective with acceptablelong-term results. Varying anatomical pre-conditions and the heterogeneouspopulation itself are challenging and contribute toward a higher reablation rate.Therefore, AF ablation in ACHD should be reserved for dedicated and highlyspecialized teams.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Role of Contact Force Sensing in Catheter Ablation of Cardiac Arrhythmias: Evolution or History Repeating Itself?,/pubmed/29929663,"Adequate catheter-tissue contact facilitates efficient heat energy transfer totarget tissue. Tissue contact is thus critical to achieving lesion transmurality and success of radiofrequency (RF) ablation procedures, a fact recognized morethan 2 decades ago. The availability of real-time contact force (CF)-sensingcatheters has reinvigorated the field of ablation biophysics and optimized lesionformation. The ability to measure and display CF came with the promise ofdramatic improvement in safety and efficacy; however, CF quality was noted tohave just as important an influence on lesion formation as absolute CF quantity. Multiple other factors have emerged as key elements influencing effective lesion formation, including catheter stability, lesion contiguity and continuity, lesiondensity, contact homogeneity across a line of ablation, spatiotemporal dynamicsof contact governed by cardiac and respiratory motion, contact directionality,and anatomic wall thickness, in addition to traditional ablation indices of powerand RF duration. There is greater appreciation of surrogate markers as a guide tolesion formation, such as impedance fall, loss of pace capture, and change inunipolar electrogram morphology. In contrast, other surrogates such as tactilefeedback, catheter motion, and electrogram amplitude are notably poor predictors of actual contact and lesion formation. This review aims to contextualize therole of CF sensing in lesion formation with respect of the fundamental principlesof biophysics of RF ablation and summarize the state-of-the-art evidence behindthe role of CF in optimizing lesion formation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Medium-Term Follow-Up of Early Leaflet Thrombosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,/pubmed/29929639,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate medium-term outcomes inpatients with leaflet thrombosis (LT).BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of early LT after transcatheter aorticvalve replacement, diagnosed by computed tomography angiography in approximately 10% of patients, is uncertain.METHODS: In this observational study, computed tomographic angiography wasperformed a median of 5 days after transcatheter aortic valve replacement andassessed for evidence of LT. Follow-up consisted of clinical visits, telephonecontact, or questionnaire.RESULTS: LT was diagnosed in 120 of 754 patients (15.9%). Patients with LT wereless likely male (36.7% vs. 47.0%, pÊ= 0.045), with a lower rate of atrialfibrillation (28.3% vs. 41.5%, pÊ= 0.008). Peri- and post-proceduralcharacteristics were comparable between groups (e.g., valve implantationtechnique; pÊ= 0.116). During a median follow-up period of 406 days, there wereno significant differences in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and thesecondary combined endpoint of stroke and transient ischemic attack betweenpatients with LT and those without LT (18-month Kaplan-Meier estimate formortality 86.6% vs. 85.4%, pÊ= 0.912; for stroke- or transient ischemicattack-free survival 98.5% vs. 96.8%, pÊ= 0.331). In univariate and multivariate analyses, LT was not predictive of either endpoint, whereas male sex (pÊ= 0.03), atrial fibrillation (pÊ= 0.002), and more than mild paravalvular leak (pÊ= 0.015)were associated with all-cause mortality.CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective observational cohort undergoingpost-transcatheter aortic valve replacement computed tomographic angiography, LT was not associated with increased mortality or rates of stroke over a follow-upperiod of 406 days.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
A practical approach to infarction of the spleen as a rare manifestation of multiple common diseases.,/pubmed/29929401,"INTRODUCTION: There are insufficient data on the aetiologic factors underlyingsplenic infarction (SI). Therefore, there is no consensus regarding theappropriate diagnostic approach.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted with SIfrom 1/2004 to 12/2014. Medical records were screened for the clinicalpresentation, underlying causes, associated medical conditions and methods ofpatient evaluation.RESULTS: We found 89 subjects with 90 episodes of SI. Presentation of SI wascharacterized by abdominal, flank and chest pain (82.2%, 18.9%, 7.8%,respectively); leukocytosis (in 67% of tested subjects); elevated LDH (72%), CRP (97.5%) and D-Dimer (100%). The main underlying mechanisms were cardioembolic(54.4%), vascular (20%), haematologic disorders (15.6%) and multiple causes(21.1%). Atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis were common in older patients(age_>_70 yrs) while antiphospholipid syndrome occurred exclusively in youngerindividuals. SI was the presentation of previously unknown medical conditions in 38% of patients. Abdominal CT, ECG, echocardiography and blood culturesdemonstrated the highest diagnostic yield.CONCLUSIONS: Contributing factors are identified in the majority of SI patients. We recommend CT, ECG, echocardiography and blood cultures in all cases. Atrialfibrillation should be sought in older patients, while APLS and haematologicdisorders should be suspected in younger ones.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The association of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atrial fibrillation: a review.,/pubmed/29929399,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and causes anenormous burden to human health and health-care systems all over the world. Agreat proportion of this burden results from increased risk of cardiovasculardiseases. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic heart arrhythmiaglobally and it increases the risk of embolic stroke and heart failure. Recentstudies have explored the association between NAFLD and AF with somewhatconflicting results. However, ultrasound-verified prospective studies concur thatNAFLD is associated with the incidence of AF. According to epidemiologicalevidence, the greater the prevalence of NALFD in a population, the stronger theassociation with AF incidence and prevalence. Specifically, diabetic individuals with NAFLD are at the greatest risk of AF. Additionally, the risk of AF mayconcentrate most in individuals with advanced NAFLD, particularly those withliver fibrosis. The possible mechanistic factors between NAFLD and AF,particularly obesity and systemic inflammation, are diverse and form a complexinterplaying network. However, further studies are needed to elucidate whetherNAFLD has a causative role in the development of AF. The purpose of this article is to review and discuss the epidemiologic evidence and possible mechanisticlinks between these two conditions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"QT correction across the heart rate spectrum, in atrial fibrillation and ventricular conduction defects.",/pubmed/29928779,"BACKGROUND: Incorporation of QTc in clinical decision support systems requiresaccurate QT-interval correction, also during common ECG abnormalities asventricular conduction defects (VCD). We compared the performance and predictive value of QT correction formulas to design a patient-specific QT correctionalgorithm (QTcA).METHODS: The first ECG in adult patients with sinus rhythm (SR), atrialfibrillation (AF) and ventricular pacing (VP) was collected retrospectively. QTcorrection was performed with Bazett (QTcB), Fridericia (QTcFri), Framingham,Hodges and Rautaharju (QTcR) formulas. Correction formulas were compared usingQTc/RR linear regression. Adjusted Cox regression was performed to predict 1-yearall-cause mortality.RESULTS: A total of 49737 patients were included (70.0% SR, 24.1% AF, 5.9% VP,11.1% VCD). Overall 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 11.8%. In patientswithout VCD or VP QTcFri showed significant better heart rate correction, bothoverall (pÊ<Ê0.001) and in subgroups by heart rate (bradycardia pÊ²Ê0.001, normalpÊ²Ê0.050, tachycardia pÊ²Ê0.010). Furthermore, QTcFri improved mortalityprediction significantly when compared to QTcB (p<0.001). In patients with VCD orVP QTcR, including correction for QRS duration, had a significant better heartrate correction than QTcB (pÊ²Ê0.010) and improved mortality predictionsignificantly compared to all other formulas (pÊ<Ê0.001). Implementing QTcA,designed based on QTcFri and QTcR depending on the presence of VCD or VP, reducedthe patients considered to be at risk by 61.1% when compared to QTcB.CONCLUSIONS: A patient-specific QT correction algorithm would combine accurateheart rate correction, improved predictive value of mortality and a reduction of patients considered to be at risk.

ICD shockrates using the novel SST algorithms in Japanese patients are still unknown.METHODS: All 2,770 patients in the PainFree SST study (Japan [JPN]: NÊ=Ê181,other geographies [OJPN]: NÊ=Ê2,589) were included in this analysis.RESULTS: Japanese patients had higher average LVEF (PÊ<Ê0.0001), higherprevalence of secondary prevention indications (PÊ<Ê0.0001), non-ischemiccardiomyopathy (PÊ<Ê0.0001), and permanent AF (PÊ<Ê0.0001). The appropriate shockrate at 12 months was not different between JPN and OJPN: 6.4% and 6.3%,respectively (PÊ=Ê0.95). The inappropriate shock rate at 12 months wassignificantly higher in Japanese patients (2.9% vs. 1.7%, PÊ=Ê0.017). However,after propensity score matching to adjust for the difference in baselinecharacteristics, the difference in inappropriate shock rate was not statisticallysignificant (PÊ=Ê0.51).CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the appropriate shock rate between Japan and other geographies. The inappropriate shock rate in Japan was low, although itwas slightly higher compared to other geographies due to baseline characteristicsincluding a higher prevalence of permanent AF. There was not a statisticallysignificant difference after adjusting for baseline characteristics. This articleis protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Is the time between first diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and cryoballoon ablation a predictor of efficacy?,/pubmed/29927782,"AIMS: Cryoablation is an indicated therapy for the treatment of recurrent atrial fibrillation through pulmonary vein isolation; however, the optimal time between first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and cryoablation is still unknown. Weaimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of early versus later treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by cryoablation.METHODS: Five hundred and ten patients underwent atrial fibrillation cryoablationand were prospectively followed for at least 6 months in 43 Italian cardiologycenters. The population was divided into two groups according to the time sincethe first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation until the index cryoablationprocedure. An early-treatment group had an elapsed time of 15 months or less fromatrial fibrillation diagnosis until cryoablation, and the late-treatment grouphad an elapsed time of greater than 15 months. During the evaluation, clinicalefficacy was defined as atrial fibrillation recurrence outside a landmark 90-day blanking period, and safety was defined as the reporting of all procedure-relatedcomplications.RESULTS: In the total cohort, cryoablation was performed after a median of 36months from the point of the patient diagnosis with drug refractory symptomaticrecurrent atrial fibrillation. The early-treatment group was composed of 130(25%) patients, whereas the late-treatment group had 380 (75%) patients. Bothcohorts had similar baseline clinical characteristics. Of 510 patients, 22 had a complication related to the procedure with no difference between the two groups. Multivariable analysis showed that the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence wassignificantly higher in the late-treatment group (hazard ratio: 1.77; 95%confidence interval 1.00-3.13) CONCLUSION: In our multicenter observationalexamination, cryoablation was well tolerated and effective in the treatment ofpatients with drug refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.Reducing the time between diagnosis and ablation brought about a treatment thathad a lower risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence with no change insafety.(Italian ClinicalService Project: NCT01007474).",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Characteristics of atrial fibrillation patients suffering atrioesophageal fistula after radiofrequency catheter ablation.,/pubmed/29927012,"INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in atrial fibrillation (AF)patients can cause various complications and atrioesophageal (AE) fistula is one of the most catastrophic complications of RFCA.METHODS AND RESULTS: RFCA registries from 3 cardiovascular centers in Republic ofKorea consisted of 5,721 patients undergoing 6,724 procedures. Before undergoing RFCA, patients underwent either computed tomography or magnetic resonanceimaging. We evaluated clinical, anatomical, and procedural characteristics ofpatients who developed AE fistula after RFCA. A total of 10 patients developed AEfistula after RFCA (0.15% per procedure). All AE fistulas occurred duringfirst-time RFCA. Eight patients died and mortality rate was 80.0%. All patientsdid not have any gastrointestinal symptom at the time of discharge and meanduration time from RFCA to symptom onset was 23.4 days. Six patients (60.0%) had paroxysmal AF. Substrate modification in addition to pulmonary vein isolation wasperformed in 4 patients (40.0%). Patients with old age, low body weight, and highCHA2 DS2 -VASc score were at increased risk of AE fistula. Baseline imagingevaluation revealed that esophagus had closest contact with LA posterior wallnear left inferior pulmonary vein rather than left superior pulmonary vein andall documented AE fistulas were located near left inferior pulmonary vein.CONCLUSION: Posterior wall of LA near left inferior pulmonary vein was the mostvulnerable location for AE fistula. Pulmonary vein isolation was the main lesion set associated with AE fistula and old age, low body weight, and high CHA2 DS2-VASc score were significant risk factors for AE fistula.

"Heart rate during exercise: mechanisms, behavior, and therapeutic and prognostic implications in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.",/pubmed/29926282,"Exercise intolerance is a typical manifestation of patients affected by heartfailure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); however, the relationship amongfunctional capacity, mortality, and exercise-induced heart rate response duringexercise remains unclear in either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation subjects. Heart rate increase during incremental load exercise has a typical pattern innormal subjects, whereas it is commonly compromised in HFrEF patients, mainly dueto the imbalance of the autonomic nervous system. In the present review, we aimto describe the behavior of heart rate during exercise in normal subjects and in HFrEF patients in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, understanding andexplaining the mechanism leading to a different exercise performance andfunctional limitation. Moreover, the role of chronotropic incompetence and theneed of standardizing the cutoff criteria are also discussed in order to clarify the clinical importance, the prognostic relevance, and the potential therapeutic implications of this condition. Looking into the relative contribution andinteraction of heart rate response during exercise might represent an importantissue to guide individualized therapeutic interventions and prognostic assessmentin HFrEF patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Effectiveness and accuracy of arrhythmia detection algorithm with the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor].,/pubmed/29925184,"Objective: To investigate the accuracy of arrhythmia detection algorithm and the effectiveness of Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor (ICM). Methods: Thissingle-center, descriptive, non-controlled clinical study was designed to enroll consecutive patients who were implanted with Reveal LINQ ICM in MinneapolisVeterans Affairs Medical Center from June 19, 2014 to April 18, 2017. The safety of implant procedure, the accuracy of automatic arrhythmia detection algorithmand the clinical effectiveness were evaluated and validated independently by two physicians. Results: Sixty patients with average age of (65±13) years (30-89years) were enrolled and the follow-up duration was 466 days (30-1 072 days). Of these, 57 patients are male. The indications of ICM implantation were unexplainedsyncope in 35 cases, cryptogenic stroke in 13 cases, atrial fibrillation (AF)management in 5 cases, and palpitations in 7 cases. The implantation procedurewas safe and successful in all patients without complications. The detectionaccuracy of arrhythmia algorithm was 86% (620/723), 82% (2 369/2 876), and 30%(411/1 380) for tachycardia, bradycardia, and pause events, respectively. Thedetection accuracy of arrhythmia algorithm for AF was 17% (5/30), 60% (1 569/2632) and 69% (172/251) for cryptogenic stroke, unexplained syncope, and AFmanagement, respectively. Important clinical findings were observed in 15% (9/60)patients. Only 5% (3/60) patients had important findings based on the intendedclinical indications. Conclusion: The Reveal LINQ ICM is a safe, simple, andeffective procedure for the detection of tachycardia and bradycardia events.However, the automatic AF and pause events detection algorithm had high falsepositive rate which requires further improvement.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,

Time-to-effect guided pulmonary vein isolation utilizing the third-generation versus second generation cryoballoon: One year clinical success.,/pubmed/29924380,"BACKGROUND: The second-generation cryoballoon (CB2) provides effective anddurable pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) associated with encouraging andreproducible clinical outcome data. The latest-generation cryoballoon (CB3)incorporates a 40% shorter distal tip, thus allowing for an increased rate of PVIreal-time signal recording and facilitating individualized ablation strategiestaking the time-to-effect (TTE) into account. However, whether thischaracteristic translates into favorable clinical success has not been evaluated yet. Herein was investigated one-year clinical success after CB3 in comparison toCB2 based-PVI.METHODS: 110 consecutive patients with paroxysmal or short-standing persistentatrial fibrillation (AF) underwent CB2 (n = 55 patients) -or CB3 (n = 55patients) -based PVI. The freeze-cycle duration was set to TTE + 120 s if TTEcould be recorded, otherwise a fixed freeze-cycle duration of 180 s was applied.RESULTS: A total of 217/218 (99%, CB3) and 217/217 (100%, CB2) pulmonary veins(PV) were successfully isolated. The real-time PVI visualization rate was 69.2%(CB3) and 54.8% (CB2; p = 0.0392). The mean freeze-cycle duration was 194 ± 77 s (CB3) and 206 ± 85 s (CB2; p = 0.132), respectively. During a median follow-up of409 days (interquartile range [IQR] 378-421, CB3) and 432 days (IQR 394-455, CB2)73.6% (CB3) and 73.1% of patients (CB2) remained in stable sinus rhythm after asingle procedure (p = 0.806).CONCLUSIONS: A higher rate of real-time electrical PV recordings was seen usingthe CB3 as compared to CB2.

Echocardiographic predictors of atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation: A literature review.,/pubmed/29924375,"BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation (CA) is a well-known treatment option for patients with symptomatic drug-resistant atrial fibrillation (AF). Multiple factors havebeen identified to determine AF recurrence after CA, however their predictivevalue is rather small. Identification of novel predictors of CA outcome istherefore of primary importance to reduce health costs and improve long-termresults of this intervention. The recurrence of AF following CA is related to theseverity of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, extend of atrial dilatation andfibrosis. The aim of this paper was to present and discuss the latest studies on utility of echocardiographic parameters in terms of CA effectiveness in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF.METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO databases were searched for studiesreporting echocardiographic preprocedural predictors of AF recurrence after CA.LV systolic and diastolic function, as well as atrial size, strain anddyssynchrony were taken into consideration.RESULTS: Twenty one full-text articles were analyzed, including threemeta-analyses. Several echocardiographic parameters have been reported todetermine a risk of AF recurrence after CA. There are conventional methods thatmeasure left atrial (LA) size and volume, LV ejection fraction, parametersassessing LV diastolic dysfunction, and methods using more innovativetechnologies based on speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to determine LAsynchrony and strain. Each of these parameters has its own predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: Regarding CA effectiveness, every patient has to be evaluatedindividually to estimate the risk of AF recurrence, optimally using a combinationof several echocardiographic parameters.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Inhibition of Small Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium (SK) Channels Prevents Arrhythmias in Rat Atria During ë_-Adrenergic and Muscarinic Receptor Activation.,/pubmed/29922167,"Sympathetic and vagal activation is linked to atrial arrhythmogenesis. Here weinvestigated the small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK)-channel pore-blockerN-(pyridin-2-yl)-4-(pyridine-2-yl)thiazol-2-amine (ICA) on action potential (AP) and atrial fibrillation (AF) parameters in isolated rat atria during _-adrenergic[isoprenaline (ISO)] and muscarinic M2 [carbachol (CCh)] activation. Furthermore,antiarrhythmic efficacy of ICA was benchmarked toward the class-IC antiarrhythmicdrug flecainide (Fleca). ISO increased the spontaneous beating frequency but did not affect other AP parameters. As expected, CCh hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (-6.2 ± 0.9 mV), shortened APD90 (24.2 ± 1.6 vs. 17.7 ± 1.1 ms), andeffective refractory period (ERP; 20.0 ± 1.3 vs. 15.8 ± 1.3 ms). The duration of burst pacing triggered AF was unchanged in the presence of CCh compared tocontrol atria (12.8 ± 5.3 vs. 11.2 ± 3.6 s), while _-adrenergic activationresulted in shorter AF durations (3.3 ± 1.7 s) and lower AF-frequency compared toCCh. Treatment with ICA (10 _M) in ISO -stimulated atria prolonged APD90 and ERP,while the AF burden was reduced (7.1 ± 5.5 vs. 0.1 ± 0.1 s). In CCh-stimulatedatria, ICA treatment also resulted in APD90 and ERP prolongation and shorter AFdurations. Fleca treatment in CCh-stimulated atria prolonged APD90 and ERP andabbreviated the AF duration to a similar extent as with ICA. Muscarinic activatedatria constitutes a more arrhythmogenic substrate than _-adrenoceptor activatedatria. Pharmacological inhibition of SK channels by ICA is effective under bothconditions and equally efficacious to Fleca.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The safety and accuracy of ECG-guided PICC tip position verification applied in patients with atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29922068,"Background: Tip position verification of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) is essential to the use of the catheter. Postprocedural chest X-ray asthe ""gold standard"" practice for PICC tip confirmation can lead to a significant delay for patient IV therapy, cost more, and lead to radiation exposure for both patients and staffs. Intracavitary electrocardiogram (IC-ECG)-guided PICCplacement which provides real-time tip confirmation during the insertionprocedure has been widely used. However, safety and accuracy of ECG for abnormal surface ECG patients, such as patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), have notbeen reported.Objective: To determine the safety and accuracy of IC-ECG technique for PICC tip position verification among the patients with AF.Patients and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a teaching and tertiary referral hospital with more than 3,600 beds in Qingdao, People'sRepublic of China. Adult patients with diagnosis of AF who need a PICC forinfusion from June 2015 to May 2017 were enrolled in the study. For everyincluded patient with AF, ECG was used to detect the PICC tip position duringcatheterization and X-ray was done to confirm the tip position as the ""goldstandard"" after PICC insertion. The effectiveness and accuracy of ECG-guidedcatheter tip positioning and chest X-ray confirmation were compared.Results: Totally, 118 AF patients with 118 PICCs were enrolled (58 male and 60female, age range 50-89 years old). There was no catheterization-relatedcomplication. When the catheter entered the lower 1/3 of superior vena cava, the amplitude of f wave reached the maximum. There was no statistical differencebetween X-ray PICC tip position verification and IC-ECG PICC tip positionverification among patients with AF (_2=1.31, P=0.232). Utilizing the cutoffpoint of f wave change ³0.5 cm, a sensitivity of 0.94, a specificity of 0.71, apositive predictive value of 0.98, and a negative predictive value of 0.42 wereobserved. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.909(95% CI: 0.810-1.000).Conclusion: The ECG-guided technique represents a safe and accurate technique to verify the position of PICC tip in patients with AF and could potentially remove the requirement for postprocedural chest X-ray among the patients with AF.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Risk evaluation of new-onset atrial fibrillation complicating ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a comparison between GRACE and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores.,/pubmed/29922048,"Purpose: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common finding in patientswith myocardial infarction (MI), but few studies are available regarding theprediction model for its risk estimation. Although Global Registry of AcuteCoronary Events (GRACE) risk score (RS) has been recognized as an effective tool for the risk evaluation of clinical outcomes in patients with MI, its usefulness in the prediction of post-MI NOAF remains unclear. In this study, we sought tovalidate the discrimination performance of GRACE RS in the prediction of post-MI NOAF and to make a comparison with that of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in patientswith ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Patients and methods: A total of 488 patients with STEMI who were admitted to ourhospital between May 2015 and October 2016 without a history of atrialfibrillation were retrospectively evaluated in this study. GRACE and CHA2DS2-VAScscores were calculated for each patient. Patients were divided into low (GRACERS²125)-, intermediate (GRACE RS 126-154)-, and high (GRACE RS³155)-risk groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to evaluate thediscrimination performance of both RSs. Model calibration was evaluated by using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HLS).Results: Of the 488 eligible patients, 49 (10.0%) developed NOAF duringhospitalization. In the overall cohort, the discrimination performance of GRACERS (C-statistic: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72-0.80) was significantly better than that ofCHA2DS2-VASc score (C-statistic: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.64-0.72; comparison p=0.03). Forsubgroup analysis, GRACE RS tended to be better than the CHA2DS2-VASc score inall but the intermediate-risk group as evidenced by C-statistics of 0.60 and 0.65for GRACE and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, respectively. Excellent calibration wasachieved except for GRACE RS in females (HLS p=0.05).Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of GRACE RS is relatively high as well as better than that of the CHA2DS2-VASc score with respect to the prediction ofpost-MI NOAF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Multiclass Classifier based Cardiovascular Condition Detection Using Smartphone Mechanocardiography.,/pubmed/29921933,"Cardiac translational and rotational vibrations induced by left ventricularmotions are measurable using joint seismocardiography (SCG) and gyrocardiography (GCG)Êtechniques. Multi-dimensional non-invasive monitoring of the heart reveals relative information of cardiac wall motion. A single inertial measurement unit(IMU) allows capturing cardiac vibrations in sufficient details and enables us toperform patient screening for various heart conditions. We envision smartphonemechanocardiography (MCG) for the use of e-health or telemonitoring, which uses amulti-class classifier to detect various types of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)using only smartphone's built-in internal sensors data. Such smartphoneApp/solution could be used by either a healthcare professional and/or the patienthim/herself to take recordings from their heart. We suggest that smartphone couldbe used to separate heart conditions such as normal sinus rhythm (SR), atrialfibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD), and possibly ST-segmentelevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) in multiclass settings. An applicationcould run the disease screening and immediately inform the user about theresults. Widespread availability of IMUs within smartphones could enable thescreening of patients globally in the future, however, we also discuss thepossible challenges raised by the utilization of such self-monitoring systems.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mechanisms and Drug Development in Atrial Fibrillation.,/pubmed/29921647,"Atrial fibrillation is a highly prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and the mostimportant cause of embolic stroke. Although genetic studies have identified anincreasing assembly of AF-related genes, the impact of these genetic discoveries is yet to be realized. In addition, despite more than a century of research andspeculation, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AF have not beenestablished, and therapy for AF, particularly persistent AF, remains suboptimal. Current antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with a significant rate of adverseevents, particularly proarrhythmia, which may explain why many highly symptomaticAF patients are not receiving any rhythm control therapy. This review focuses on recent advances in AF research, including its epidemiology, genetics, andpathophysiological mechanisms. We then discuss the status of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for AF today, reviewing molecular mechanisms, and the possible clinicaluse of some of the new atrial-selective antifibrillatory agents, as well as drugsthat target atrial remodeling, inflammation and fibrosis, which are being tested as upstream therapies to prevent AF perpetuation. Altogether, the objective is tohighlight the magnitude and endemic dimension of AF, which requires a significanteffort to develop new and effective antiarrhythmic drugs, but also improve AFprevention and treatment of risk factors that are associated with AFcomplications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Atrial fibrillation after transhiatal esophagectomy with transcervical endoscopic esophageal mobilization: one institution's experience.,/pubmed/29921284,"BACKGROUND: There have been numerous studies regarding atrial fibrillation (AF)associated with cardiac and pulmonary surgery; however, studies looking atesophagectomy and atrial fibrillation are sparse. The goal of this study was toreview our institution's atrial fibrillation rate following esophagectomy inorder to better define the incidence and predisposing factors in this patientpopulation.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing esophagectomywith transcervical endoscopic mobilization of the esophagus (TEEM) at the MedicalCollege of Wisconsin and Affiliated Hospitals from July 2009 through December2012.RESULTS: Seventy-one patients underwent TEEM esophagectomy during the studyperiod. Of those, 23 (32.4%) patients developed new atrial fibrillationpostoperatively. ICU (Intensive Care Unit) length of stay was 7.1Êdays for those that did not receive amiodarone, compared to 5.3Êdays for those that did receive amiodarone (p_<_0.025). Those that went into AF spent on average 9.3Êdays in the ICU compared to 4.7Êdays for their counterparts that did not go into AF(p_<_0.006). Total length of stay was not statistically different betweenpopulations [15.1 +/-_11.3Êdays compared to 13.5 +/-_9.4Êdays for those who didnot go into AF (p_<_0.281)]. Receiving preoperative amiodarone was found toreduce the overall incidence of AF. There was a trend towards decreased risk ofgoing into AF in those who received preoperative amiodarone with an adjustedhazard ratio of 0.555 (p_=_0.057).CONCLUSION: Similar to data reported in previous literature, postoperative atrialfibrillation was found to increase ICU length of stay as well as overall lengthof hospital stay. Preoperative amiodarone administration displayed a trend towarddecreasing the rates of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing TEEM.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease].,/pubmed/29921184,"The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Abstract. Increasing life expectancy in Western countries isassociated with a high prevalence of multiple chronic diseases which is definedby the term ""multimorbidity"". Many of these patients suffer from chronic kidneydisease (CKD) and thrombogenic comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation with theneed for oral anticoagulation. For decades vitamin K antagonists have beenexclusively prescribed for oral anticoagulation. However, due to alteredpharmacokinetics and bioavailability of these drugs in CKD, a significant risk ofbleeding exists. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants as a new andpromising alternative to vitamin K antagonists was -especially for CKD patients -highly anticipated. However, data from randomized studies are missing for olderpatients with advanced CKD. Consequently, a careful evaluation of therisk-benefit ratio is recommended for this sensitive patient population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Relationship between International Normalized Ratio and Outcomes in Modern Trials with Warfarin Controls.,/pubmed/29920722,"A target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3 has been recommended forpatients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and risk factors for thromboembolism. Thisrecommendation is largely based on evidence from observational studies a decadeago. This study utilized collective data from modern trials with warfarincontrols to examine the relationship of warfarin anticoagulation, as assessed by INR, on the clinical outcome events of interest.METHODS: Data on warfarin-treatedpatients from 3 clinical studies supporting the approval of dabigatran (Pradaxa¨ ), apixaban (Eliquis¨ ), and edoxaban (Savaysa¨ ) were pooled. Ischemic stroke,intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and all-cause death were selected as the outcomeevents of interest. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to examinethe association between time-dependent INR and each outcome event. Benefit-riskassessment was evaluated by summing the estimated annual event rate for ischemic stroke and ICH.RESULTS: A total of 21,883 patients representing 322 ischemic strokes, 288 ICHs, and 657 all-cause deaths were included in the analysis. The models used suggestthat the risk of ischemic stroke is greatly reduced when INR exceeds 2; incontrast, the risk of ICH increases monotonically as INR increases. Whencombining ischemic stroke and ICH events, the lowest estimated annual event rate was observed between INR of 2 and 2.5; the risk only slightly increased betweenINR of 1.8 and 3.0. Similarly, a U-shaped relationship between INR and the riskof all-cause death was found.CONCLUSIONS: This study using collective warfarin data from recent largeprospective trials indicates that INR between 2 and 2.5 provides the best balancebetween ischemic stroke and ICH, as well as optimal protection against death inpatients with AF.

"Trends and Variation in Oral Anticoagulant Choice in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation, 2010-2017.",/pubmed/29920705,"OBJECTIVE: Since 2010, several non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants(NOACs) have been brought to the U.S. market, yet little is known regarding theirevolving adoption for prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation (AF) related stroke. We examined temporal trends in choice of oral anticoagulants (OACs) among incidentOAC users with AF and its association with patient demographic and clinicalcharacteristics.METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional analysis of medical and pharmacyclaims for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees in a large, private, U.S. health plan. We identified 112,187 adults with nonvalvular AF starting OACsbetween October 2010 and March 2017. Multivariable logistic regression was usedto examine the associations of patient characteristics with prescription of NOACsvs warfarin. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the associations ofpatient characteristics with choice among NOACs.RESULTS: The prescription of NOACs has increased dramatically since theirintroduction in October 2010. In the first quarter of 2017 (2017Q1), 7,502patients started OACs, of whom 78.9% used NOACs and 21.1% warfarin. For NOACs,3.8% used dabigatran, 25.0% rivaroxaban, and 50.1% apixaban. In multivariableanalyses, factors associated with choice of NOACs vs warfarin included youngerage, lower stroke or bleeding risk, fewer comorbidities, higher education levelor household net worth, and prescription by cardiologists (all P<0.001). Therewas no sex difference in likelihood of filling NOACs vs warfarin in 2010Q4-2012but women had higher odds of starting NOACs (odds ratio=1.19; 95% confidenceinterval=1.14-1.25) in 2015-2017Q1. Among NOAC users, the odds of apixabanprescription increased with age, female sex, stroke or bleeding risk, andcomorbidities (all P<0.05).CONCLUSION: NOAC prescriptions have increased substantially among incident OACusers with nonvalvular AF, predominantly driven by increased prescription ofapixaban. Warfarin and apixaban were generally preferred for elderly patients,patients with higher stroke or bleeding risk, and patients with morecomorbidities. This article is protected by copyright.

Long-term risk of hemorrhagic stroke in patients with infective endocarditis: a Danish nationwide cohort study.,/pubmed/29920590,"Background: The present study aimed to investigate the long-term risk ofhemorrhagic stroke (HS) in patients with infective endocarditis (IE).Methods: Using a register-based nationwide cohort of 9 million Danes, wepropensity score-matched patients with left-sided IE from 1977 to mid-2015 withIE-free individuals (1:10). Follow up started one year after the IE diagnosis.Hazard ratios (HRs) for HS in IE patients compared to the matched cohort wereestimated using Cox regression.Findings: During follow-up of 5,735 IE patients with left sided IE from one year after IE diagnosis and up to 37á5 years (median 6á3 years), 103 cases of HS were observed. Compared to the matched cohort, IE patients had higher long-term riskof HS (HR 1á47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1á20-1á80; p=0.0002). The risk of HSwas particularly increased in patients within the lowest propensity scorequartile (HR 2á60; 95 % CI 1á89-3á58). Mediation analyses suggested that theincreased HS risk could be explained by an indirect effect of insertion of amechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation or treatment with anticoagulants. Thecumulative risk of HS 30 years after start of follow-up was 3á0 % in IE patients.Conclusion: IE does not directly increase the long-term risk of HS. The apparent excess risk of HS in patients with previous IE was explained by mediatingfactors; mechanical heart valve insertion, atrial fibrillation andanticoagulation medication.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy outcomes included ischemic stroke, stentthrombosis, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), all-cause mortality andmyocardial infarction (MI); safety outcome was major bleeding. We conductedmeta-analysis and used odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) tocompare TT and DAPT. Meta-regression, sensitivity and subgroup analysis weretaken to investigate the source of heterogeneity in the outcome of majorbleeding.RESULTS: 14 eligible observational studies with 11,697 subjects were identified. Compared with DAPT, TT had decreased the risk of ischemic stroke [OR = 0.74, 95% CI (0.59, 0.93), P = 0.009] and stent thrombosis [OR = 0.40, 95% CI (0.18, 0.93),P = 0.033]. While, there was an increased risk of major bleeding [OR = 1.55, 95% CI (1.16, 2.09), P = 0.004] associated with TT. The risk of MACE, all-causemortality and MI had no significant statistical difference between TT and DAPT.Furthermore, the results of univariate and multivariate meta-regression analysis implicated that there were no obvious correlations between certain baselinecharacteristics (age, gender, race, hypertension, study design) and risk of majorbleeding. Also of major bleeding, the findings of sensitivity analysis weregenerally robust, and a prespecified subgroup analysis of race demonstrated that the source of heterogeneity might attribute to Asian studies mostly.CONCLUSIONS: TT reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and stent thrombosis with an acceptable major bleeding risk compared with DAPT, and TT was considered as avalid alternative in AF patients undergoing coronary stenting. Furtherprospective randomized trials are needed to ensure the reliability of these data and find the optimal therapeutic strategy in this setting of patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association of Thromboembolic Risk Score with Left Atrial Thrombus and Spontaneous Echocardiographic Contrast in Non-Anticoagulated Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients.,/pubmed/29920487,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the association ofCHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scores with left atrial thrombus (LAT) and spontaneousechocardiographic contrast (SEC) in non-anticoagulated nonvalvular atrialfibrillation (NVAF) spontaneous patients, and to develop a new scoring system forLAT/SEC prediction.METHODS: Consecutive non-anticoagulated NVAF patients with or without LAT/SEC by transesophageal echocardiography were identified in the Guangdong GeneralHospital.RESULTS: Among 2,173 patients, the prevalence of LAT/SEC was 4.9%. Bothpredictive values of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores for the presence of LAT/SECwere low-to-moderate (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] = 0.591 and 0.608, respectively, pÊ= 0.90). By multivariate analysis, non-paroxysmal AF, decreasedleft ventricular ejection fraction, and left atrial enlargement were positivelyassociated with LAT/SEC, while CHADS2/CHA2DS2VASc scores were not. A new scoring system based on these 3 factors above significantly improved the discriminationfor LAT/SEC (ROC = 0.792).CONCLUSIONS: CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scores had limited value in predicting LAT/SEC; a new scoring system that combines AF type and echocardiographic parameters maybetter predict LAT/SEC as a surrogate for cardioembolic risk in NVAF patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Life's Simple 7 and the risk of atrial fibrillation: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.,/pubmed/29920438,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We examined the association between the American HeartAssociation's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metrics and the risk of atrial fibrillation(AF) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohortstudy of adults free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.METHODS: We analyzed data from 6506 participants. The LS7 metrics (smoking,physical activity, body mass index, diet, blood pressure, total cholesterol andblood glucose) were each categorized into ideal (assigned 2 points), intermediate(1 point) or poor (0 points). Scores were summed for a maximum of 14. A score of 0-8 was considered inadequate; 9-10, average and 11-14, optimal forcardiovascular health. Atrial fibrillation was ascertained using ICD-9 codes fromhospital discharge records and Medicare claims data. Cox proportional hazardratios (HR) and incidence rates of AF per 1000 person-years were calculated.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.2 years (interquartile range: 10.6-11.7 years), 709 (11%) participants were hospitalized with a first AF episode. In the overall cohort, optimal scores at baseline were associated with a 27% lower risk for AF compared with inadequate scores (0.73 [0.59-0.91]). A similar finding was observed when the results were stratified by race/ethnicity (White, ChineseAmerican, African American and Hispanic), though many of the associations werenot statistically significant. There was no interaction by race/ethnicity(p_=_0.15).CONCLUSIONS: In the overall cohort, optimal LS7 status was associated with alower risk of AF. These findings suggest that promoting ideal cardiovascularhealth may reduce the incidence and burden of AF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Primary stroke prevention: a paradigm shift focusing on silent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29917150,"We review the prevalence, predictability, prognosis, and preventability of atrialfibrillation and associated cardiogenic brain embolism, focusing on 'silent'subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) which is very common in the elderly, andassociated with significantly increased risk of stroke and cardiovascularmortality. The current paradigm treats atrial fibrillation once discovered by itssymptoms, complications (stroke) or by chance, and screening recommendations are limited to opportunistic pulse palpation. We argue that the marked incidence ofSCAF in patients over 65justifies a much more active approach to identifypatients at a particularly high-risk by routine evaluation of readily-availableclinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and laboratory markers. Elderlypatients at high-risk need further monitoring by suitable devices (occasionally, long-term) and treatment with DOACs once SCAF is revealed. This approach canalready be adopted during clinical encounters at the general practitioner andconsultant level, to decrease the substantial SCAF-associated morbidity andmortality.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Generation and primary characterization of iAM-1, a versatile new line of conditionally immortalized atrial myocytes with preserved cardiomyogenic differentiation capacity.",/pubmed/29917042,"Aims: The generation of homogeneous cardiomyocyte populations from fresh tissueor stem cells is laborious and costly. A potential solution to this problem wouldbe to establish lines of immortalized cardiomyocytes. However, as proliferationand (terminal) differentiation of cardiomyocytes are mutually exclusiveprocesses, their permanent immortalization causes loss of electrical andmechanical functions. We therefore aimed at developing conditionally immortalizedatrial myocyte (iAM) lines allowing toggling between proliferative andcontractile phenotypes by a single-component change in culture mediumcomposition.Methods and results: Freshly isolated neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (AMs)were transduced with a lentiviral vector conferring doxycycline-controlledexpression of simian virus 40 large T antigen. Under proliferative conditions(i.e. in the presence of doxycycline), the resulting cells lost mostcardiomyocyte traits and doubled every 38_hours. Under differentiation conditions(i.e. in the absence of doxycycline), the cells stopped dividing andspontaneously reacquired a phenotype very similar to that of primary AMs in gene expression profile, sarcomeric organization, contractile behaviour, electricalproperties and response to ion channel-modulating compounds (as assessed bypatch-clamp and optical voltage mapping). Moreover, differentiated iAMs had much narrower action potentials and propagated them at_>_10-fold higher speeds thanthe widely used murine atrial HL-1 cells. High-frequency electrical stimulationof confluent monolayers of differentiated iAMs resulted in reentrant conductionresembling atrial fibrillation, which could be terminated by tertiapin treatment,just like in monolayers of primary AMs.Conclusion: Through controlled expansion and differentiation of AMs, largenumbers of functional cardiomyocytes were generated with properties superior tothe differentiated progeny of existing cardiomyocyte lines. iAMs provide anattractive new model system for studying cardiomyocyte proliferation,differentiation, metabolism and (electro)physiology and to investigate cardiacdiseases and drug responses, without using animals.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical and genetic factors influencing acenocoumarol dosing: a cross-sectional study.,/pubmed/29916837,": Coumadin oral anticoagulants are widely used in multiple clinical scenarios.Their narrow therapeutic range and a dosing strategy based on 'a posteriori'algorithms, pose them as an interesting group for prediction modelling research. Extensive literature explaining the association between clinical and geneticvariables with the dose of warfarin have been published. Limited informationexists regarding these factors and acenocoumarol dosing. The aim of the study is to explain through clinical/genetic variables, the weekly dose of acenocoumarolnecessary for achieving stable anticoagulation status. We performed across-sectional study enrolling adults under treatment with acenocoumarol with atleast three consecutive INRs between 2 and 3. To explain the association between demographic, clinical and genotype data (VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2) and the mean weekly dose of acenocoumarol, we performed a multiple linear regression model. Inour cohort, a higher age, the presence of atrial fibrillation, chronic renalfailure and VKORC1 haplotype A were associated with a lower mean weekly dose ofacenocoumarol. On the other side, a higher weight was associated with a higherweekly dose. Amongst anticoagulated adult patients, VKORC1 genotype and baseline clinical factors can explain acenocoumarol dosing, and therefore, help clinicianswhile deciding the initial anticoagulant dose.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Features of atrial fibrillation in wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis: a systematic review and clinical experience.,/pubmed/29916559,"AIMS: Wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) cardiac amyloidosis has emerged as animportant cause of heart failure in the elderly. Atrial fibrillation (AF)commonly affects older adults with heart failure and is associated with reducedsurvival, but its role in ATTRwt is unclear. We sought to explore the clinicalimpact of AF in ATTRwt.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with biopsy-proven ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis(nÊ=Ê146) were retrospectively identified, and clinical, echocardiographic, andbiochemical data were collected. Patients were classified as AF or non-AF andfollowed for survival for a median of 41.4Ê±Ê27.1Êmonths. Means testing,univariable, and multivariable regression models were employed. A systematicreview was performed. AF was observed in 70% (nÊ=Ê102). Mean age was similar (AF,75Ê±Ê6 vs. non-AF, 74Ê±Ê5Êyears, PÊ=Ê0.22). Anticoagulant treatment of patientswith AF was as follows: 78% warfarin, 17% novel anticoagulant, and 6% noanticoagulation. Amiodarone was prescribed to 24%. There were no differences inleft ventricular ejection fraction (PÊ=Ê0.09) or left atrial volume (PÊ=Ê0.87);however, mean diastolic dysfunction grade was higher in AF (mean 2.7Ê±Ê0.5 vs.2.4Ê±Ê0.5, PÊ=Ê0.01). While creatinine (PÊ=Ê0.52) and B-type natriuretic peptide (PÊ=Ê0.48) were similar, patients with AF had lower serum transthyretinconcentrations (221Ê±Ê51 vs. 250Ê±Ê52Ê_g/mL, PÊ<Ê0.01). Survival between groupswas similar (PÊ=Ê0.46).CONCLUSIONS: These data provide an evidence basis for clinical management anddemonstrate that AF in ATTRwt does not negatively impact survival. Furtheranalysis of the relationship between transthyretin concentration and AFdevelopment is warranted.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Antithromboembolic Strategies for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,/pubmed/29915905,"We set out to synthesize available data on antithrombotic strategies for patientswith atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI), with a focus on triple antithrombotic therapy (triple therapy [TT]; dualantiplatelet therapy plus an anticoagulant) versus dual therapy (DT; oneantiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant). We searched OVID MEDLINE and PubMedfrom January 2005 to September 2017 using the search terms oral anticoagulant,triple therapy, dual therapy, acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronaryintervention, and atrial fibrillation (limited to randomized controlled trials,observational studies, English language, minimum 6-12Êmonths of follow-up,minimum 100 human patients). We excluded surveys, literature reviews, articlesnot directly related to TT versus DT, incomplete studies, and short-termin-hospital studies. All eligible studies were reviewed to evaluate possibleantithrombotic management strategies for patients with AF undergoing PCI.Extracted studies were categorized according to the specific anticoagulant(vitamin K antagonist vs. direct-acting oral anticoagulant) and P2Y12 inhibitorused. Each category review was followed by a discussion providing insight intothe quality of evidence and implications for practice. We found that the risk of bleeding with TT was higher than with DT, without demonstrated added benefit ofreducing major adverse cardiovascular events. TT use should be minimized inpatients with high bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors should becritically analyzed to select appropriate antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Enterococcus Faecalis Infective Endocarditis and Colorectal Carcinoma: Case of New Association Gaining Ground.,/pubmed/29915636,"Mostly Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) bacteremia and endocarditis (60%) has been found to be associated with underlying colorectal cancer (CRC). Enterococcusfaecalis (E. faecalis) bacteremia and endocarditis has no identifiable source in most of the cases. E. faecalis is part of normal gut flora that can translocatethrough the intestine and cause the systemic infection. With any intestinallesion or tumor, the barrier is breached and the gut flora like E. faecalis cantranslocate and cause infection. A 55-years-old male known to have non-ischemiccardiomyopathy with implantation of automated implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (AICD) and atrial fibrillation presented with weight loss, feverand back pain. He was diagnosed to have E. faecalis bacteremia and subsequentendocarditis and osteomyelitis of T7 - T8 and L4 - L5 vertebrae. He underwentcolonoscopy for screening of malignancy because of his age and presentingsymptoms suggestive of one. The colonoscopy found pedunculated polyp in sigmoidcolon, and after biopsy the histology revealed an invasive well differentiatedmucinous adenocarcinoma, with focal squamous differentiation. He underwentremoval of AICD and antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis andosteomyelitis. He underwent sigmoid colectomy with pathology of removed specimen showing adenocarcinoma with negative margins and lymph nodes. In many of thepatients with E. faecalis endocarditis, if identifiable the source isgenitourinary tract. But in most of the cases the source of E. faecalisbacteremia is unidentified. There is some evidence to suggest that in patientswith unidentified source, colonoscopy may reveal a hidden early stage CRC oradenoma. We conclude that in cases of E. faecalis bacteremia and endocarditiswith unidentified source, colonoscopy should be considered if feasible to ruleout the diagnosis of CRC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Value of multilocus genetic risk score for atrial fibrillation in end-stage kidney disease patients in a Polish population.,/pubmed/29915175,"Genetic factors play a key role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). We would like to establish an association between previously describedsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and AF in haemodialysed patients withend-stage kidney disease (ESKD-HD) as well as to assess the cumulative effect of all genotyped SNPs on AF risk. Sixteen SNPs were genotyped in 113 patients withAF-ESKD-HD and in 157 controls: without AF (NAF) and with ESKD-HD. Thedistribution of the risk alleles was compared in both groups and betweendifferent sub-phenotypes. The multilocus genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated to estimate the cumulative risk conferred by all SNPs. Several loci showed atrend toward an association with permanent AF (perm-AF): CAV1, Cx40 and PITX2.However, GRS was significantly higher in the AF and perm-AF groups, as comparedto NAF. Three of the tested variables were independently associated with AF: malesex, history of myocardial infarction (MI) and GRS. The GRS, which combined 13previously described SNPs, showed a significant and independent association with AF in a Polish population of patients with ESKD-HD and concomitant AF. Furtherstudies on larger groups of patients are needed to confirm the associations.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A propensity matched analysis of robotic, minimally invasive, and conventional mitral valve surgery.",/pubmed/29915143,"OBJECTIVES: Institutional studies suggest robotic mitral surgery may beassociated with superior outcomes. The objective of this study was to compare theoutcomes of robotic, minimally invasive (mini), and conventional mitral surgery.METHODS: A total of 2300 patients undergoing non-emergent isolated mitral valveoperations from 2011 to 2016 were extracted from a regional Society of ThoracicSurgeons database. Patients were stratified by approach: robotic (n=372), mini(n=576) and conventional sternotomy (n=1352). To account for preoperativedifferences, robotic cases were propensity score matched (1:1) to bothconventional and mini approaches.RESULTS: The robotic cases were well matched to the conventional (n=314) and mini(n=295) cases with no significant baseline differences. Rates of mitral repairwere high in the robotic and mini cohorts (91%), but significantly lower withconventional (76%, P<0.0001) despite similar rates of degenerative disease. Allprocedural times were longest in the robotic cohort, including operative time(224 vs 168_min conventional, 222 vs 180_min mini; all P<0.0001). The roboticapproach had comparable outcomes to the conventional approach except there werefewer discharges to a facility (7% vs 15%, P=0.001) and 1 less day in thehospital (P<0.0001). However, compared with the mini approach, the roboticapproach had more transfusions (15% vs 5%, P<0.0001), higher atrial fibrillation rates (26% vs 18%, P=0.01), and 1_day longer average hospital stay (P=0.02).CONCLUSION: Despite longer procedural times, robotic and mini patients hadsimilar complication rates with higher repair rates and shorter length of staymetrics compared with conventional surgery. However, the robotic approach wasassociated with higher atrial fibrillation rates, more transfusions and longerpostoperative stays compared with minimally invasive approach.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-guided Clopidogrel maintenance therapy reduces cardiovascular events in atrial fibrillation patients requiring anticoagulation therapy and scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention: a prospective cohort study.,/pubmed/29914380,"BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we found that titrating clopidogrel maintenance doses (MDs) according to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) monitoring minimised the rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE)after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) without increasing bleeding inpatients with high on-treatment platelet reaction to clopidogrel. This studyaimed to investigate whether VASP-guided clopidogrel MD could reducethromboembolism and bleeding in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients requiringanticoagulation and scheduled for PCI.METHODS: AF patients scheduled for PCI were recruited between July 2014 and July 2016. These patients were allocated into VASP-guided (n_=_250) and control(n_=_253) groups depending on the clopidogrel MD profile. In the VASP-guidedgroup, clopidogrel MD was titrated by the platelet reactivity index (PRI),whereas in the control group, clopidogrel MD was fixed at 75Êmg per day. Theprimary endpoint was MACCE and secondary endpoints were thrombolysis inmyocardial infarction (TIMI) major and minor bleeding 1Êyear after PCI.RESULTS: Five hundred and three patients were included in the present study, with1-year data available for 95.6% patients. The average CHA2DS2-VASc score of thewhole population was 3.7_±_0.7 and the average HAS-BLED score was 3.2_±_0.4.MACCE was less in the VASP-guided group than in the control group (2.5% vs. 5.0%,P_=_0.02). The incidence of major bleeding was comparable between both groups(3.0% vs. 2.8%, P_=_0.72) and minor bleeding was higher in the VASP-guided group than in the control group (15.3% vs. 9.7%, P_=_0.03). Kaplan-Meier analysisindicated that there was no difference in survival between both groups (log-rank test, P_=_0.68).CONCLUSIONS: In AF patients requiring anticoagulation and scheduled for PCI,VASP-guided antiplatelet therapy reduced major cardiovascular and cerebraladverse events, accompanied by increased minor bleeding events.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study was retrospectively registered in theChinese Clinical Trial Registry, A Primary Registry of the International ClinicalTrial Registry Platform, World Health Organisation (Registration no:ChiCTR-IOR-17013854 ).

Evaluation of the impact of body mass index on warfarin requirements in hospitalized patients.,/pubmed/29914293,"BACKGROUND: Despite well established empiric dose adjustments for drug anddisease-state interactions, the impact of body mass index (BM) on warfarinremains unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate warfarin requirementsin hospitalized patients, stratified by BMI.METHODS: This retrospective review included two cohorts of patients: cohort A(patients admitted with a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR)) andcohort B (newly initiated on warfarin during hospitalization). Exclusion criteriaincluded: age under 18 years, pregnancy, INR (goal 2.5-3.5), and warfarinthromboprophylaxis post orthopedic surgery. The primary outcome was mean totalweekly dose (TWD) of warfarin based on weight classification: underweight (BMI<18 kg/m2), normal/overweight (BMI 18-29.9 kg/m2), obese (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2), andmorbidly obese (BMI _ 40 kg/m2). Data were extracted from two community hospitalsin reverse chronologic order during July 2015-June 2013 until both studyinstitutions evaluated 100 patients per cohort in each BMI classification oruntil all patients had been evaluated within the prespecified timeframe.RESULTS: A total of 585 patients were included in cohort A (26 underweight, 200normal/overweight, 200 obese, 159 morbidly obese). There was a statisticallysignificant difference in TWD as determined by one-way analysis of variance ( p <0.05). A Tukey post hoc test revealed a statistically significantly higher TWD inmorbidly obese (41.5 mg) compared with underweight (25.6 mg, p < 0.05),normal/overweight (28.8 mg, p < 0.05) and obese patients (32.4 mg, p < 0.05). In cohort B, 379 patients were evaluated (9 underweight, 166 normal/overweight, 152 obese, 52 morbidly obese). Overall, 191 patients had a therapeutic INR ondischarge (88.9% underweight, 52.4% normal/overweight, 44.1% obese, 55.8%morbidly obese, p = 0.035). Of those, there was a statistically significantdifference in TWD ( p = 0.021) with a higher TWD in the morbidly obese (41 mg)compared with underweight patients (24.4 mg, p = 0.017).CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, morbidly obese patients mayrequire higher TWD to obtain and maintain a therapeutic INR.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Atrial fibrillation in young patients.,/pubmed/29912584,"INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia worldwide.While mostly seen in elderly, it can also affect young adults (²45 years of age),older adolescent and children.

Specificissues arise over diagnostic workup as well as antiarrhythmic and anticoagulationtherapies. The future management and diagnostic strategies are also discussed.Expert commentary: Management of AF in the young adult is largely extrapolatedfrom adult studies and guidelines. In this population, AF could reveal a genetic pathology (e.g. Brugada or Long QT syndrome) or be the initial presentation of a cardiomyopathy.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the setting of left atrial appendage thrombus.,/pubmed/29912432,"OBJECTIVES: Left atrial appendage thrombus (LAT) was an exclusion criterion inthe seminal transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) trials; however, suchpatients do undergo TAVR in the 'real-world' setting. This study sought toanalyse outcomes after TAVR in patients with LAT or spontaneous echo contrast(SEC).METHODS: All patients undergoing TAVR at our institution between March 2009 andDecember 2014 were prospectively analysed. The presence of LAT or SEC wasdetermined via a retrospective chart review. Primary outcomes included 30-day and1-year neurological events as well as mortality.RESULTS: Of the 369 patients undergoing TAVR, 3.8% (14) were found to have LATand 6.8% (25) were found to have SEC, and they were separately compared topatients who did not have LAT or SEC. Significant differences were noted between groups with regard to preoperative renal function, atrial fibrillation andejection fraction. Preoperative atrial fibrillation was the only independentpredictor of LAT. No perioperative complications were associated with thepresence of LAT or SEC. Specifically, no patient with LAT or SEC experienced apostoperative neurological event. While neither LAT nor SEC was an independentpredictor of 30-day mortality, LAT was an independent predictor of 1-yearmortality (odds ratio 3.573, 95% confidence interval 1.040-12.28; P_=_0.042).CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that TAVR may be performed in patientswith LAT and SEC with a low risk of embolic complications. While neither was anindependent predictor of 30-day mortality, LAT was an independent predictor of1-year mortality. Larger studies are needed to better study this phenomenon.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
PREVEntion and regReSsive Effect of weight-loss and risk factor modification on Atrial Fibrillation: the REVERSE-AF study.,/pubmed/29912366,"Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease. Obesity is associatedwith progression of AF. This study evaluates the impact of weight and risk factormanagement (RFM) on progression of the AF.Methods and results: As described in the Long-Term Effect of Goal-Directed WeightManagement in an Atrial Fibrillation Cohort: A Long-Term Follow-Up (LEGACY)Study, of 1415 consecutive AF patients, 825 had body mass index_³_27_kg/m2 andwere offered weight and RFM. After exclusion, 355 were included for analysis.Weight loss was categorized as: Group 1 (<3%), Group 2 (3-9%), and Group 3(³10%). Change in AF type was determined by clinical review and 7-day Holteryearly. Atrial fibrillation type was categorized as per the Heart Rhythm Society consensus. There were no differences in baseline characteristic or follow-upduration between groups (P_=_NS). In Group 1, 41% progressed from paroxysmal topersistent and 26% from persistent to paroxysmal or no AF. In Group 2, 32%progressed from paroxysmal to persistent and 49% reversed from persistent toparoxysmal or no AF. In Group 3, 3% progressed to persistent and 88% reversedfrom persistent to paroxysmal or no AF (P_<_0.001). Increased weight loss wassignificantly associated with greater AF freedom: 45 (39%) in Group 1, 69 (67%)in Group 2, and 116 (86%) in Group 3 (P_²_0.001).Conclusion: Obesity is associated with progression of the AF disease. This study demonstrates the dynamic relationship between weight/risk factors and AF.Weight-loss management and RFM reverses the type and natural progression of AF.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Prevalence and prevention of oesophageal injury during atrial fibrillation ablation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29912306,"Aims: Atrio-oesophageal fistula (AOF) is a potentially lethal complication ofatrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Many studies have evaluated the presence andprevention of endoscopically-detected oesophageal lesions (EDOL) as a proxymeasure for risk of AOF. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought todetermine the prevalence of EDOL and effectiveness of general preventive measuresduring AF ablation.Methods and results: We searched electronic databases for studies reportingprevalence or prevention of EDOL post-AF ablation. Pooled prevalence werereported with 95% confidence intervals (CI) while studies evaluating preventivemeasures including oesophageal temperature monitoring (OTM), esophagealmanipulation and type of anaesthesia were analyzed descriptively or byrandom-effects modeling. Twenty-five studies were included in the analysis. Anyand ulcerated EDOL pooled prevalence was 11% (95%CI, 6-15%) and 5% (95%CI, 3-7%),respectively. In six studies, there was no difference in EDOL with or without OTM(pooled OR 1.65, 95%CI, 0.22-12.55). There was no difference using a multi-sensorversus single-sensor OTM (one study) nor when using a deflectable probe (twostudies). Oesophageal displacement was associated with significantinstrumentation injury in one study. Two studies evaluating Oesophageal coolingshowed conflicting results. General anaesthesia was associated with more EDOLthan conscious sedation in two studies.Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of any and ulcerated EDOL post-ablation was 11%and 5%, but varied between studies. Techniques such as OTM and oesophagealdisplacement or cooling have not conclusively demonstrated a reduction in EDEL,while general anaesthesia may be associated with higher EDOL risk. Furtherrandomized data are critically needed to validate and develop measures to preventEDOL and AOF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of new generation loop recorders placed during surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29911345,"BACKGROUND: Current postsurgical atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation guidelinesencourage serial rhythm evaluation; however, traditional Holter monitoring may becumbersome for patients and yield limited data. An implantable loop recorder (LR)may provide increased data on the incidence of postablation arrhythmias. Wesought to evaluate the use of a new generation LR implanted during surgical AFablation.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on adult patients undergoingsurgical AF ablation. All patients had subcutaneous placement of a LR. Data were collected on patient demographics, concomitant surgical procedures,complications, loop recorder extraction, and additional arrhythmia interventions.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients underwent surgical AF ablation with intraoperativeplacement of a LR during the study period. The median age was 71 and the majorityhad long-standing persistent AF. Mitral and aortic valve pathology was the mostcommon reason for concomitant operations. Four devices were explanted prior tothe completion of follow-up due to high AF burdens detected by the LR requiringcatheter ablation or pacemaker placement. A 100% correlation between in-clinicrhythm detected by the LR and electrocardiogram was observed. No infectiouscomplications, device malfunctions, or deaths occurred.CONCLUSIONS: LRs placed intraoperatively during surgical ablation of AF arefeasible and with nominal, if any, complications. More comprehensive rhythmanalysis may aid with determination of operative success and the need foradditional intervention or cessation of antiarrhythmic or anticoagulantmedications.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
"Closure, Anticoagulation, or Antiplatelet Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke With Patent Foramen Ovale: Systematic Review of Randomized Trials, Sequential Meta-Analysis, and New Insights From the CLOSE Study.",/pubmed/29910193,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) comparing patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure,anticoagulation, and antiplatelet therapy to prevent stroke recurrence inpatients with PFO-associated cryptogenic stroke.METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE throughMarch 2018. The primary outcome was stroke recurrence. Pooled incidences, hazard ratios, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses.PFO closure was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke compared withantithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation: 3560 patientsfrom 6 RCTs; RR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.79; I2=59%). The effect of PFO closure onstroke recurrence was larger in patients with atrial septal aneurysm or largeshunt (RR=0.27, 95% CI, 0.11-0.70; I2=42%) compared with patients without theseanatomical features (RR=0.80, 95% CI, 0.43-1.47; I2=12%). Major complicationsoccurred in 2.40% (95% CI, 1.03-4.25; I2=77%) of procedures. New-onset atrialfibrillation was more frequent in patients randomized to PFO closure versusantithrombotic therapy (RR=4.33, 95% CI, 2.37-7.89; I2=14%). One RCT compared PFOclosure versus anticoagulation (353 patients; hazard ratio=0.14, 95% CI,0.00-1.45) and 2 RCTs compared PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy (1137patients; hazard ratio=0.18, 95% CI, 0.05-0.63; I2=12%). Three RCTs comparedanticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy, with none showing a significantdifference.CONCLUSIONS: PFO closure is superior to antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke recurrence after cryptogenic stroke. The annual absolute risk reduction of strokewas low, but it has to be tempered by a substantial time at risk (at least5Êyears) in young and middle-aged patients. PFO closure was associated with anincreased risk of atrial fibrillation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
THE GAP BETWEEN ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS ON DABIGATRAN FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.,/pubmed/29909809,"OBJECTIVES: As model-based economic evaluations (MBEEs) are widely used to makedecisions in the context of policy, it is imperative that they represent clinicalpractice. Here, we assess the relevance of MBEEs on dabigatran for the preventionof stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS: We performed a systematic review on the basis of a developedquestionnaire, tailored to oral anticoagulation in patients with AF. Includedstudies had a full body text in English, compared dabigatran with a vitamin Kantagonist, were not dedicated to one or more subgroup(s), and yielded anincremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The relevance of all MBEEs was assessed on the basis of ten context-independent factors, which encompassed clinical outcomesand treatment duration. The MBEEs performed for the United States were assessedon the basis of seventeen context-dependent factors, which were related to thecountry's target population and clinical environment.RESULTS: The search yielded twenty-nine MBEEs, of which six were performed forthe United States. On average, 54 percent of the context-independent factors wereincluded per study, and 37 percent of the seventeen context-dependent factors in the U.S.STUDIES: The share of relevant factors per study did not increase over time.CONCLUSIONS: MBEEs on dabigatran leave out several relevant factors, limitingtheir usefulness to decision makers. We strongly urge health economic researchersto improve the relevance of their MBEEs by including context-independentrelevance factors, and modeling context-dependent factors befitting the decision context concerned.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparative risks of bleeding, ischemic stroke and mortality with direct oral anticoagulants versus phenprocoumon in patients with atrial fibrillation.",/pubmed/29909576,"PURPOSE: The pivotal trials for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrialfibrillation (NVAF) compared rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban with warfarin,as did most claims-based studies. Comparisons with phenprocoumon, the mostfrequently used vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in Germany, are scarce.METHODS: Risk of bleeding, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality in patientswith NVAF were analyzed using data for 2010 to 2014 from a large German claimsdatabase. New users of oral anticoagulants from January 2012 to December 2013were included and observed over 1Êyear. Baseline characteristics were adjustedusing propensity score matching and logistic regression. Several sensitivityanalyses were carried out.RESULTS: Fifty-nine thousand four hundred forty-nine rivaroxaban, 23,654dabigatran, 4894 apixaban, and 87,997 matched phenprocoumon users were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) compared with phenprocoumonwere as follows: hospitalized bleedings: rivaroxaban 1.04 (0.97; 1.11),dabigatran 0.87 (0.77; 0.98), and apixaban 0.65 (0.50; 0.86); ischemic stroke:rivaroxaban 1.05 (0.94; 1.17), dabigatran 1.14 (0.96; 1.35), and apixaban 1.84(1.20; 2.84); all-cause mortality: rivaroxaban 1.17 (1.11; 1.22), dabigatran 1.04(0.95; 1.13), and apixaban 1.14 (0.97; 1.34).CONCLUSIONS: With rivaroxaban, no significant differences were observed compared to phenprocoumon with regard to hospitalized bleedings or ischemic strokes.Dabigatran was associated with fewer bleedings and a similar risk of ischemicstrokes compared to phenprocoumon. Apixaban was also associated with fewerbleedings but was unexpectedly associated with more ischemic strokes, possiblyreflecting selective prescribing. The association of rivaroxaban with higherall-cause mortality unrelated to bleedings or strokes has been describedpreviously but remains to be explained.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Health-related quality of life after bleeding adverse events associated with antithrombotic drug therapy - a systematic review.,/pubmed/29908761,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQOL)following adverse bleeding events associated with antithrombotic drug therapy.This systematic review assesses the HRQOL of patients who suffered a bleedingevent related to antithrombotic drug use.METHODS: Literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and the CochraneLibrary from inception through June 16, 2017. Studies measuring HRQOL after ableeding event related to antithrombotic drug therapy for primary or secondaryprevention of a thromboembolic event were included.RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 13,209 patients met the inclusion criteria,of which 3,649 patients developed a bleeding event. Patients included receivedantithrombotic drug use because of acute myocardial infarction or atrialfibrillation. EQ-5D, SF-36 and GHP MOS-13 were used to measure HRQOL. Thefollow-up time ranged from 6 to 29 months. Patients who suffered a bleeding eventreported worse HRQOL in comparison to those who did not (EQ-5D - average increaseon all domains of 0.09, p-values ranging from <0.001 to 0.003; SF-36 - averagedecrease on all domains of 21.4, p<0.001; GHP MOS-13 score - decrease of 11.9points, p<0.05) and an increased health concern (13.4 points increase; p<0.05).CONCLUSION: Adverse bleeding events which can occur from the use ofantithrombotic agents are associated with a clinically relevant lower HRQOL anddeserve more attention as part of the shared decision making process betweenpatients and providers. These data should be valuable for facilitating moresubstantive care and risk discussions regarding potential changes in outcome and rehabilitation.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association of fibrotic remodeling and cytokines/chemokines content in epicardial adipose tissue with atrial myocardial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29908372,"BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with atrialfibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.OBJECTIVE: Using human left atrial appendage (LAA) samples, we examined theinteractive relationship between the EAT profile and atrial myocardial fibrosisthrough histological and biochemical analyses.METHODS: LAA samples were obtained from 59 consecutive AF patients duringcardiovascular surgery. In histological analysis, adipose tissue, atrialmyocardial fibrosis, EAT fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, and matrixmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1_ (Hif-1_) expressionwere evaluated in LAA sections. In biochemical analysis,pro-inflammatory/fibrotic proteins in EAT, total collagen in the LA myocardium,angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2)-related proteins in EAT, andpro-inflammatory/fibrotic proteins in serum were evaluated.RESULTS: Histology revealed that the severity of fibrotic remodeling of EAT wasassociated with LA myocardial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical andelectron-microscopic findings revealed that fibrotic remodeling of EAT wasassociated with the infiltration of macrophages and myofibroblasts.Protein-concentration analysis demonstrated that the total collagen in the LAmyocardium was positively correlated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibroticcytokines/chemokines, including interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1, tumor necrosis factor-_, vascular endothelial growth factor, and MMP2 and MMP9 in EAT. The pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines/chemokines inEAT and the total collagen in the LA were also positively correlated with theAngptl2 in EAT.CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that fibrotic remodeling andcytokines/chemokines in peri-LA EAT were associated with atrial myocardialfibrosis as a substrate of AF. Our results also suggested that overexpression of Hif-1_ and Angptl2 may be involved in these processes.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Causes and Predictors of Readmission in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Catheter Ablation: A National Population-Based Cohort Study.,/pubmed/29907655,"BACKGROUND: Reducing readmission after catheter ablation (CA) in atrialfibrillation (AF) is important.METHODS AND RESULTS: We utilized National Readmission Data (NRD) 2010-2014. AFwas identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition,Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic code 427.31 in the primary field,while first CA of AF was identified via ICD-9-procedure code 37.34. Any admissionwithin 30 or 90Êdays of index admission was considered a readmission. Coxproportional hazard regression was used to adjust for confounders. The primaryoutcomes were 30- and 90-day readmissions and the secondary outcome was AFrecurrence. In total, 1Ê128Ê372 patients with AF were identified from January 1, 2010 to September 30, 2014. Of which 37Ê360 (3.3%) underwent CA. Patients aged³65Êyears and female sex were less likely to receive CA for AF. Overall, 10.9%and 16.5% of CA patients were readmitted within 30 and 90Êdays post-CA,respectively. Most common causes of readmissions were arrhythmia (AF, atrialflutter), heart failure, pulmonary causes (pneumonia, chronic obstructivepulmonary disease) and bleeding complications (gastrointestinal bleed,intracranial hemorrhage). Patients with diabetes mellitus, heart failure,coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic pulmonary and kidney disease, priorstroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), female sex, length of stay ³2 anddisposition to the facility were prone to higher 30- and 90-day readmissionspost-CA. Predictors of increase in AF recurrence post-CA were female sex,diabetes mellitus,Êchronic pulmonary disease, and length of stay ³2. Trends of90-day readmission and AF recurrence were found to improve over the study period.CONCLUSIONS: We identified several demographic and clinical factors associatedwith the use of CA in AF, and short-term outcomes of the same, which couldpotentially help in the patient selection and improve outcomes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predictors of mitral annulus enlargement?

Revisiting the Role of Antiarrhythmic Drugs in Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence: A Single Center Retrospective Review.,/pubmed/29904452,"Background: We conducted a retrospective analysis to revisit the efficacy of fourdifferent commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in a single communityhospital setting in the U.S. We used cardiac implantable electronic devices(CIEDs) to continuously monitor the patients for maintenance of sinus rhythm. TheCIEDs in our study included insertable cardiac monitor (ICM), permanent pacemaker(PPM) and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D). The aim was tocompare efficacy of commonly used AADs for maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.Methods: We conducted our retrospective study in a real world practice setting.We analyzed electronic medical records of 145 consecutive patients withparoxysmal and persistent AF who were treated with AADs for maintenance of sinus rhythm between the period of April 2014 and February 2018.Results: Total 34 out of 145 patients (23.45%) had AF recurrence. The meanduration of first AF recurrence in total patient cohort was 18.01 ± 12 months.There was no major difference in efficacy in terms of prevention of first episodeof AF recurrence among commonly used class III and class IC AADs.Conclusions: Higher doses clearly seem to be more effective in preventing therecurrence of AF in class III AADs; sotalol and amiodarone.

In conclusion,patients presenting for AFl ablation in SR were younger and healthier but hadmore atrial fibrillation induced during their ablation procedure, with a trendtoward more postablation AA due to additional arrhythmia substrate.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Periodontal Disease, Systemic Inflammation and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease.",/pubmed/29903685,"Periodontal and cardiovascular disease are both major health issues. Poor oralhealth has long been associated with the development of systemic diseases, withthe typical example being the risk of endocarditis posterior to dentalprocedures. Through the years, the association of periodontal disease with other non-infectious systemic diseases has been brought to attention. One of the mostinteresting associations is the one that exists with the development ofcardiovascular disease. Many studies, including systematic reviews andmeta-analyses, suggest an important association between periodontal disease andischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, atrialfibrillation and peripheral artery disease. Among the proposed mechanisms of thisrelationship, systemic inflammation appears to play a major role. Evidencesuggests that periodontal inflammation triggers a systemic inflammatory statethat, added to the damage mediated by antibodies that cross react betweenperiodontal pathogens and components of the intimal wall, and the direct lesionof the intima by bacteria entering the circulation, promotes atheroma plaquedevelopment and progression. There are other studies that show a clearrelationship between periodontal disease severity, elevations of inflammatorymarkers, and the presence of atherosclerosis. Here, we give a review of theavailable evidence supporting this association, and the possible mechanismsinvolved.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The data were analyzedwith RevMan 5.3 using a fixed-effects method.RESULTS: 6 RCTs and 1903 patients were included. There was no significantdifference between NOACs group and VKAs group in incidence of stroke or TIA(OR_=_1.00, 95% CI_=_0.23-4.40, P_=_1.00), silent cerebral thromboembolic events (OR_=_1.09, 95% CI_=_0.67-1.75, P_=_0.74) or minor bleeding (OR_=_1.01, 95%CI_=_0.78-1.31, P_=_0.93), which were consistent in subgroup analysis ofindividual NOAC vs. VKAs group.

"Feasibility of a novel, synthetic, self-assembling peptide for suture-line haemostasis in cardiac surgery.",/pubmed/29903028,"BACKGROUD: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of PuraStat¨, a novelhaemostatic agent, in achieving suture line haemostasis in a wide range ofcardiac surgical procedures and surgery of the thoracic aorta.METHODS: A prospective, non-randomised study was conducted at our institution.Operative data on fifty consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery wherePuraStat¨ was utilised in cases of intraoperative suture line bleeding wasprospectively collected. Questionnaires encompassing multiple aspects of the easeof use and efficacy of PuraStat¨ were completed by ten surgeons (five consultantsand five senior registrars) and analysed to gauge the performance of the product.RESULTS: No major adverse cardiac events were reported in this cohort.Complications such as atrial fibrillation, pacemaker requirement and pleuraleffusions were comparable to the national average. Mean blood product use ofpacked red cells, platelets, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate wasbelow the national average. There was one incidence of re-exploration, howeverthis was due to pericardial constriction rather than bleeding. Analysis ofquestionnaire responses revealed that surgeons consistently rated PuraStat¨highly (between a score of 7 and 10 in the various subcategories). Thetransparent nature or PuraStat¨ allowed unobscured visualisation of suture sites and possessed excellent qualities in terms of adherence to site of application.The application of PuraStat¨ did not interfere with the use of other haemostatic agents or manipulation of the suture site by the surgeon.CONCLUSION: PuraStat¨ is an easy-to-use and effective haemostatic agent in a widerange of cardiac and aortic surgical procedures.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
The application of kinomic array analysis to screen for altered kinases in atrial fibrillation remodeling.,/pubmed/29902583,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of protein kinase-mediated signaling is an early event in many diseases, including the most common clinical cardiac arrhythmia, atrialfibrillation (AF). Kinomic profiling represents a promising technique to identifycandidate kinases.OBJECTIVE: Here we employ kinomic profiling to identify kinases altered in AFremodeling using atrial tissue from a canine AF-model (atrial tachypacing).METHODS: Left atrial tissue obtained in a previous canine study was used forkinome array (containing 1024 kinase pseudo-substrates) analysis. Three groups ofdogs were included: non-paced controls (C) and atrial tachypaced (TP) dogs, whichwere contrasted with geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) treated AF dogs, which areprotected from AF promotion, to enhance specificity of detection of putativekinases.RESULTS: While TP changed activity of 50 kinases, 40 of these were prevented byGGA and involved in differentiation and proliferation (SRC), contraction,metabolism, immunity, development, cell cycle (CDK4) and survival (Akt).Inhibitors of Akt (MK2206) and CDK4 (PD0332991) and overexpression of a dominant negative CDK4 phosphorylation mutant protected against tachypacing-inducedcontractile dysfunction in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Moreover, AF patients show down- and upregulation of SRC and Akt phosphorylation, respectively, similar tofindings of the kinome array.CONCLUSION: Contrasting kinomic array analyses of control and treated subjectoffers a versatile tool to identify kinases altered in atrial remodeling due totachypacing, which include Akt, CDK4 and SRC. Ultimately, pharmacologicaltargeting of altered kinases may offer novel therapeutic possibilities to treatclinical AF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
miR-146a deficiency in hematopoietic cells is not involved in the development of atherosclerosis.,/pubmed/29902229,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis involves activation of the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-_Binflammatory cascade, which is negatively regulated by miR146a. Previous studies showed that the TT genotype of rs2431697, located near the miR-146a gene, drives lower miR-146a transcription and predicts adverse cardiovascular events inanticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients. Moreover, systemic miR-146aadministration protects mice from atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated the ability of miR-146a expression in the hematopoietic component to regulate atherosclerosisin low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice (Ldlr-/-).METHODS AND RESULTS: Lethally-irradiated Ldlr-/- mice transplanted with bonemarrow from wild-type or miR-146a-null mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 8and 20 weeks. Irak1, Traf6 and MIR146A expression were quantified in thoracicaorta by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Aortic plaque size and composition werecharacterized by Oil-Red staining and immunohistochemistry and leukocyterecruitment by intravital microscopy. Blood cell counts were similar in fat-fedLdlr-/-mice with or without hematopoietic miR-146a expression. However, plasmacholesterol decreased in fat-fed Ldlr-/-mice transplanted with bone marrowdeficient for miR-146a. Finally, aortic atherosclerosis burden and recruitment ofleukocytes into the vessel wall were undistinguishable between the two groups,despite higher levels of Irak1 and Traf6 mRNA and protein in the aorta of fat-fedmice lacking hematopoietic miR-146a expression.CONCLUSIONS: miR-146a deficiency exclusively in hematopoietic cells modulatescholesterol levels in plasma and the expression of its targets in the artery wallof fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice, but does not accelerate atherosclerosis.Atheroprotection upon systemic miR-146a administration may therefore be caused byspecific effects on vascular cells.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment of the clinical efficacy of the heart spectrum blood pressure monitor for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation: An unblinded clinical trial.,/pubmed/29902218,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. The most commondiagnostic method, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), can record episodes ofarrhythmia from which the type and severity can be determined. The Heart SpectrumBlood Pressure Monitor (P2; OSTAR Meditech Corp., New Taipei City, Taiwan) isused to measure cardiovascular pressure change with fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis to obtain heart rate frequency variability and accurate blood pressuredata. We compared the diagnostic efficacy of the Heart Spectrum Blood PressureMonitor to a 12-lead ECG (gold standard) for patients with AF. Three measurement methods were used in this study to analyze the heart index and compare theresults with simultaneous 12-lead ECG: blood pressure; mean arterial pressure,which was calculated from individual blood pressure as a constant pressure; and aconstant pressure of 60 mmHg. The physician used a 12-lead ECG and the HeartSpectrum Blood Pressure Monitor simultaneously. The Heart Spectrum Blood PressureMonitor used FFT analysis to diagnose AF, and the findings were compared to the12-lead ECG readings. This unblinded clinical trial was conducted in theemergency department of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Twenty-nine subjects with AF and 33 without AF aged 25 to 97 y (mean, 63.5 y) were included. Subjects who were exposed to high-frequency surgical equipment during testing, those with cardiac pacemakers or implantable defibrillators, and pregnant women wereexcluded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), andnegative predictive value (NPV) were 97%, 97%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, formethod 1; 90%, 100%, 100%, and 91%, respectively, for method 2; and 100%, 94%,94%, and 100%, respectively, for method 3. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, andNPV for both methods ranged between 90% and 100%, indicating that the HeartSpectrum Blood Pressure Monitor can be effectively applied for AF detection.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Inguinal vascular complications after ablation of atrial fibrillation: an economic impact assessment.,/pubmed/29901719,"Aims: Ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is recommended in the guidelines as a Class Ia/IIa indication. However, associated complications should not bedismissed; specifically, inguinal vascular complications (IVC). Although IVCs aregenerally considered trivial, they represent an economic burden for theprocedure-performing hospital and the patient. Therefore, the ability to monitor and ultimately minimize potential complications is of considerable interest.Methods and results: An economic model was developed to calculate the economicimpact for certain IVC-types from a large German single-centre perspective in2015 and 2016. Twenty-nine of 1040 (2.79%) and 48 of 1152 (4.17%) AF-ablationpatients had documented IVC in 2015 and 2016 (P_=_0.08), respectively. Inguinalvascular complications that required invasive treatment (thrombin, intervention, surgery) occurred in 0.58% of the 2015 and in 0.87% of the 2016 AF-ablationcases. The expected excess costs (incorporating direct costs, benefit lostadjusted for reimbursement) per patient treated with AF-ablation were 139.54Û and153.31Û in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This was mostly driven by opportunitycosts, which could reach 15Ê544.71Û for certain IVC. Sensitivity analysisrevealed the probability of occurrence, length of stay of certain IVC types, and the revenue per day influenced the expected costs per AF-ablation patient.Conclusion: Even relatively benign complications such as IVC can result inconsiderable cost increases. Therefore, measures to reduce them should beestablished and implemented.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Case report of recurrent atrial fibrillation induced by thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma with Graves' disease.,/pubmed/29901603,"RATIONALE: Thyrotropin-secreting adenoma (TSHoma) is rare. Even though thethyrotoxicosis is mild in patients with TSHoma, it is still a rare cause ofarrhythmia, ignore of mild disfunction of thyroid function of TSHoma can lead to the delayed diagnosis of pituitary tumor or leading to recurring ofcomplications. Graves' disease is an auto-immue endocrinological disorder.Association of TSHoma and Graves's disease is extremely rare. Coexistence ofthese two diseases made the diagnosis and treatment complicated.PATIENT CONCERNS: This patient was a 55-year-old man who had been referred to thedepartment of endocrinology and metabolism of the West China Hospital due torecurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) and thyroxicosis.DIAGNOSES: Examinations revealed pituitary thyrotropin-secreting macroadenomawith Graves' disease.INTERVENTIONS: We conducted transsphenoidal surgery. Thyrozol was used to treatthe recurrence of Graves' disease after pituitary surgery.OUTCOMES: The TSHoma was successfully cured, and recurrent Graves' disease wascontrolled very well.LESSONS: The association of TSHoma and Graves' disease is extremely rare. Eventhough the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis are milder in patients withTSHoma, thyroid function tests are still important clinical assessment ofpatients with AF, which is an arrhythmia associated with hyperthyroidism. TSHoma is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis; however, ignoring of the mild disfunctioncaused by TSHoma can lead to the delayed diagnosis of pituitary tumors or torecurring of complications of TSHoma.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term effectiveness and safety of transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale compared with antithrombotic therapy: A meta-analysis of 6 randomised clinical trials and 3560 patients with reconstructed time-to-event data.,/pubmed/29901447,"AIMS: Although three recent trials showed a significant stroke risk reductionafter tPFOc, the impact on pooled evidence deserves attention and individualstatistical power is limited. We aimed to pool available randomised clinicaltrials (RCT) to assess whether tPFOc is more effective and safe thanantithrombotic therapy alone (ATA).METHODS AND RESULTS: Major electronic databases and tangential sources weresearched and 6 trials (3560 patients) identified. At a median follow-up of 3.6[2.0-5.2] years (13930 person-years), the risk of stroke was significantly lower after tPFOc compared with ATA (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12_0.64, p=0.003). Significantheterogeneity was detected (I2=66.1%), though single trials did not significantlyinfluence the results. Reconstructed time-to-event data revealed that tPFOcbenefit accrues approximately after 1 year and persists over time withoutsignificant variations (96.4% versus 88.0%; HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09_0.66, p=0.005;NNT=11). Although results showed a greater benefit in patients <45 years old,male, and with substantial shunt, interaction between subgroups was notsignificant. Trial sequential analysis showed that accumulated evidence issufficient. However, tPFOc did not confer protection against transient ischemicattack (TIA; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31_1.54, p=0.365) and a significant excess inatrial fibrillation was observed (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.99_10.10, p<0.001). Majorbleeding and migraine were comparable between treatments.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ATA, tPFOc reduces the risk of stroke at long-termfollow-up but no benefit is observed in terms of TIA. Atrial fibrillation ishigher after tPFOc, while major bleeding and migraine are comparable betweengroups.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Upregulation of miRÛÔ122 is associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis in atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29901138,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, which is associated withincreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. microRNA (miRNA/miR)_122 hasbeen reported to be related with heart diseases, however, the functional role of miR_122 in atrial fibrillation is unclear. Therefore, the aim of the presentstudy was to investigate the roles of miR_122 in atrial fibrillation. MaleC57BL/6 mice were divided into the following three groups: Control,sham_operation and AF. Mice in the AF group received transesophageal rapid atrialstimulation for the induction of AF. Cardiomyocytes isolated from mice in the AF group and were transfected with miR_122 inhibitors. Reversetranscription_quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess theexpression of miR_122 in cardiomyocytes isolated from mice in the AF,sham_operation and control groups, and in cells transfected with miR_122inhibitors. MTT and TUNEL assays were used to evaluate cardiomyocyte viabilityand apoptosis, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to assess theexpression levels of extracellular signal_regulated kinase (ERK) andphosphorylated (p)_ERK, as well as the apoptosis_associated proteins caspase_3and B_cell lymphoma 2_like 1 (Bcl_x). The present results demonstrated thatmiR_122 expression in the AF group was significantly increased compared with the sham_operation and control groups, whereas it was significantly decreasedfollowing transfection with the miR_122 inhibitor. Cardiomyocyte viability wasincreased and their apoptosis rate was significantly decreased following miR_122 transfection. In addition, the expression of the anti_apoptotic protein Bcl_x wassignificantly upregulated, whereas the expression of the pro_apoptotic caspase_3 was significantly downregulated following miR_122 inhibition. Furthermore, thep_ERK/total ERK ratio was significantly increased in the miR_122 inhibitor group compared with the AF and control groups. The present results suggested thatmiR_122 may be implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying theproliferation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in AF.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Noninvasive assessment of left atrial fibrosis. Correlation between echocardiography, biomarkers, and electroanatomical mapping.",/pubmed/29900593,"AIM: Left atrial (LA) fibrosis promotes atrial fibrillation (AF), may predictpoor radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) outcome, and may be assessedinvasively using electroanatomical mapping (EAM). Speckle trackingechocardiography (STE) enables quantitative assessment of LA function. The aimwas to assess the relationship between LA fibrosis derived from EAM and LAechocardiographic parameters as well as biomarkers of fibrosis in patients withAF.METHODS: Sixty-six patients (64% males, mean age 56Ê±Ê10) with nonvalvular AFtreated with first RFCA were prospectively studied. Seventy-three percent ofpatients were in sinus rhythm at the time of examination. LA geometry, systolic, and diastolic function were assessed. In STE global, peak atrial longitudinal(PALS) and contractile (PACS) strain were calculated. LA stiffness index (LAs) - the ratio of E/e' to PALS - was assessed. The EAM of LA was build using CartoSystem before RFCA. Low amplitude potentials area (LAPA) was quantitativelyanalyzed and expressed as a percentage of LA surface using the cut-off <0.5ÊmV todetect potential sites of fibrosis. The serum concentrations of MMP-9, PIIINP,and TGF_1were estimated before RFCA.RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between LAdiastolic function parameters: PALS (-0.54, PÊ<Ê.001), LAs (0.65, PÊ<Ê.001), and LAPA in patients who were in sinus rhythm. Also LA volume significantlycorrelated with LAPA (0.44, PÊ<Ê.002). None of biomarkers correlated with LAPA.CONCLUSION: Left atrial diastolic parameters derived from STE correlate well withthe extent of LA fibrosis. Thus, STE may be useful in the noninvasive assessment of LA fibrosis and selection of candidates for RFCA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Development and validation of the Dutch Stroke Score for predicting disability and functional outcome after ischemic stroke: A tool to support efficient discharge planning.,/pubmed/29900414,"Introduction: We aimed to develop and validate a prognostic score for disability at discharge and functional outcome at three months in patients with acuteischemic stroke based on clinical information available on admission.Patients and methods: The Dutch Stroke Score (DSS) was developed in 1227 patientswith ischemic stroke included in the Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) In Stroke study.Predictors for Barthel Index (BI) at discharge ('DSS-discharge') and modifiedRankin Scale (mRS) at three months ('DSS-3 months') were identified inmultivariable ordinal regression. The models were internally validated withbootstrapping techniques. The DSS-3 months was externally validated in thePRomoting ACute Thrombolysis in Ischemic StrokE study (1589 patients) and thePreventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (2107 patients). Model performance wasassessed in terms of discrimination, expressed by the area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration.Results: At model development, the strongest predictors of Barthel Index atdischarge were age per decade over 60 (odds ratio_=_1.55, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.41-1.68), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (odds ratio_=_1.24per point, 95% CI 1.22-1.26) and diabetes (odds ratio_=_1.62, 95% CI 1.32-1.91). The internally validated AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.75-0.79). The DSS-3 months,additionally consisting of previous stroke and atrial fibrillation, performedsimilarly at internal (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.74-0.77) and external validation (AUC0.74 in PRomoting ACute Thrombolysis in Ischemic StrokE (95% CI 0.72-0.76) and0.69 in Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (95% CI 0.69-0.72)). Observedoutcome was slightly better than predicted.Discussion: The DSS had satisfactoryperformance in predicting BI at discharge and mRS at three months in ischemicstroke patients.Conclusion: If further validated, the DSS may contribute to efficient stroke unitdischarge planning alongside patients' contextual factors and therapeutic needs.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Greater nighttime blood pressure variability is associated with left atrial enlargement in atrial fibrillation patients with preserved ejection fraction.,/pubmed/29899365,"Left atrial enlargement is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke inpatients with atrial fibrillation. Little is known regarding the associationbetween nighttime blood pressure variability and left atrial enlargement inpatients with atrial fibrillation and preserved ejection fraction. The studypopulation consisted of 140 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (meanage 64_±_10 years) with preserved ejection fraction (³50%). Nighttime bloodpressure was measured at hourly intervals, using a home blood pressure monitoringdevice. Nighttime blood pressure variability was expressed as the standarddeviation of all readings. Left atrial volume index was measured using themodified Simpson's biplane method with transthoracic echocardiography. Multipleregression analysis indicated that nighttime mean systolic/diastolic bloodpressure and its variability remained independently associated with left atrialenlargement after adjustment for age, sex, anti-hypertensive medication class,and left ventricular mass index (P_<_0.01). When patients were divided into four groups according to nighttime blood pressure and its variability, the group with higher nighttime blood pressure and its variability had significantly larger leftatrial volume than the group with lower nighttime blood pressure and itsvariability (46.6_ml/m2 vs. 35.0_ml/m2, P_<_0.0001). Higher nighttime bloodpressure and its variability are associated with left atrial enlargement. Thecombination of nighttime blood pressure and its variability has additionalpredictive value for left atrial enlargement. Intensive intervention for thesehigh-risk patients may avoid or delay progression of left atrial enlargement and reduce the risk of stroke.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Design of Potent pan-IAP and Lys-Covalent XIAP selective Inhibitors Using a Thermodynamics Driven Approach.,/pubmed/29940121,"Recently we reported that rapid determination of enthalpy of binding can beachieved for a large number of congeneric agents or in combinatorial libraries,fairly efficiently.

Low frequency of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells correlates with the occurrence of infections in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone treatment.,/pubmed/29938309,"The aim of this study was to explore the predictive implications of thecomposition of immune cell populations prior to lenalidomide plus high-dosedexamethasone (Len-Dex) initiation for the occurrence of infections. Weprospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken atbaseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) therapy andreviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients withrefractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). Risk factors for infection wereanalyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11Êcycles of Len-dextreatment, 52 (57.8%) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of atotal of 92 episodes of infection, 58 (63%) episodes were clinically defined, 29 (31.5%) episodes were microbiologically defined, and 5 (5.4%) episodes were feverof unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first3Êcycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariateanalyses, multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb (<_10Êg/dL) was a clinicallyindependent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency(P_=_0.044) and absolute count (P_=_0.014) of circulating CD3+CD4+CD161+ cellsprior to Len-dex treatment were also associated with the occurrence of infection,especially during the first 3Êcycles of Len-dex therapy.

Multiple Myeloma Index for Risk of Infection.,/pubmed/29937941,"Based on our earlier research into the main characteristics and risk factors for infections in hospitalized patients with multiple myeloma, we created thenumerical Multiple Myeloma Index for Risk of Infection (MMIRI) to predictinfection in myeloma patients. The included factors that could influence thepathogenesis and incidence of infections were sex, performance status, DurieSalmon stage of disease, International Staging System, serum creatinine level,immune paresis, neutropenia, serum ferritin level, the presence of any catheters,disease duration, stable/progressive disease, and type of therapy. For each ofthese parameters, the strength of association with infection was statisticallyestimated and specific number of points was assigned to each of these parameters,proportional to the strength of the association. When designing the MMIRI, weincluded only those parameters that we determined were pathophysiologicallyassociated with the infection. After further statistical analysis, we identified an optimal cutoff score of 6 or above as indicating a significant risk forinfection, with a sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 80.2%. The scoringsystem in the retrospective receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.918. The potential value of the MMIRI is thepossibility of identifying those patients who would benefit from the prophylacticadministration of antibiotics and other anti-infective measures while minimizing the contribution to antibiotic resistance related to the overuse of these drugs. As far as we know, this index represents the first attempt to create such aninstrument for predicting the occurrence of infections in myeloma patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Circulating Tumour DNA Analysis for Tumour Genome Characterisation and Monitoring Disease Burden in Extramedullary Multiple Myeloma.,/pubmed/29937522,"Mutational characterisation in extramedullary multiple myeloma (EM-MM) patientsis challenging due to inaccessible EM plasmacytomas, unsafe nature of multiplebiopsies and the spatial and temporal genomic heterogeneity apparent in MM(Graphical abstract).

DNA released into the blood bytumour cells (ctDNA) contains the predominant clones derived from the multipledisease foci. Blood-derived ctDNA can, therefore, provide a holistic illustrationof the major drivers of disease progression. In this report, the utility ofctDNA, as an adjunct to currently available modalities in EM-MM, is presented fora patient with EM and oligosecretory (OS) disease. Whole exome sequencing ofcontemporaneously acquired tumour tissue and matched ctDNA samples revealed thepresence of spatial and temporal genetic heterogeneity and the identification of pathways associated with drug resistance. Longitudinal monitoring of plasmasamples revealed that ctDNA can be utilised to define the dynamic clonalevolution co-existent with disease progression and as an adjunct non-invasivemarker of tumour burden.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Spinal metastases in multiple myeloma: A high-risk subgroup for ISS III patients.,/pubmed/29937188,"BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have an extremely heterogeneousprognosis. The International Staging System (ISS) is actually the most reliablestaging system and chromosomal abnormalities were integrated in the Revised-ISS. We wanted to evaluate the prognostic value of spinal secondary localization inpatients with MM and its impact on the ISS.METHODS: Epidemiological and biological data, as well as treatment protocols and secondary localization were analyzed for 650 consecutive patients diagnosed with MM from January 2006 to January 2017.RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) was dependent on the WHO performance status,ISS and Salmon and Durie stage at diagnosis. Furthermore, presence of spinalmetastases at diagnosis was predictive of a worse outcome (p_<_0.0001), whilepresence of peripheral bone metastases was not. Spinal metastases had asignificant impact on OS for ISS III patients (p_<_0.0001). Also, a history ofbone marrow graft was associated with a better OS (p_<_0.0001), whileradiotherapy had no significant impact. The multivariate analysis confirmed that the spinal metastases at diagnosis determined a high-risk subgroup for ISS IIIpatients with a very poor OS (p_<_0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Spinal metastases are a negative prognostic factor for patients withMM, especially for ISS III patients, and are associated with a shorter OS. Spinalmetastasis should be systemically searched for and should be included in amodified staging system to better manage these patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is conceived as an inverse optimization task where thealternative temporal changes of selected parameters of the ordinary differential equations represent candidate solutions and the objective function quantifies thegoals of the therapy. The system under study consists of two main cellularcomponents, tumor cells and their cellular environment, respectively. The subset of model parameters closely related to the environment is substituted byexogenous time dependencies - therapeutic pulses combining continuous functionsand discrete parameters subordinated thereafter to the optimization. Synergistic interaction of temporal parametric changes has been observed and quantifiedwhereby two or more dynamic parameters show effects that absent if eitherparameter is stimulated alone.

Venous thromboembolism in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with lenalidomide: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29934343,"Lenalidomide is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism (VTE) inpatients with multiple myeloma. This risk has not previously been defined inB-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), for which lenalidomide is also an activeagent. We conducted a systematic literature search in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 toFebruary 2017), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2017), The Cochrane Library(Wiley), and Web of Science Core Collection for prospective studies evaluatinglenalidomide-containing regimens in B-cell NHL with adequate reporting of patientcharacteristics, total cycles received, and safety data including VTE rates. The primary outcome was VTE events per 100 patient-cycles by meta-analysis usingrandom-effects models. Our literature search identified 1719 citations; 28articles were included. For all patients with B-cell NHL receiving lenalidomide, the rate of VTE per 100 patient-cycles was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI],0.48-1.12; I2, 67%). The rate for single-agent lenalidomide was 1.09 events per100 patient-cycles (95% CI, 0.49-1.94; I2, 76%), the rate for lenalidomide plusbiologics was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.17-0.97; I2, 59%), and the rate for lenalidomideplus chemotherapy was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.39-1.60; I2, 57%). Rate of VTE events inB-cell NHL patients treated with lenalidomide in clinical trials is similar tothe rate in multiple myeloma.

Amongthe screened compounds, novel inhibitor 5c inhibited the CT-L (chymotrypsin-like)activity with IC50 of 8.21_nM and the MM (multiple myeloma) cells RPMI8226, U266Band ARH77 proliferations with the IC50 of 8.99, 6.75 and 9.10_nM, respectively,which showed similar in vitro activities compared with the compound MLN2238(biologically active form of marketed MLN9708). To investigate the oralavailability, compound 5c was esterified to its prodrug 6a with the enzymaticIC50 of 6.74_nM and RPMI8226, U266B and ARH77 cell proliferations IC50 of 2.59,4.32 and 3.68_nM, respectively. Furthermore, prodrug 6a exhibited goodpharmacokinetic properties with oral bioavailability of 24.9%, similar withMLN9708 (27.8%). Moreover, compound 6a showed good microsomal stabilities anddisplayed stronger in vivo anticancer efficacy than MLN9708 in the human ARH77xenograft mouse model. Finally, cell cycle results showed that compound 6a had a significant inhibitory effect on CT-L and inhibited cell cycle progression at theG2M stage.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Organochlorine Levels in Plasma and Risk of Multiple Myeloma: Organochlorines and risk of multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29933318,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between organochlorine pesticides andpolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and multiple myeloma (MM).METHODS: The risk of MM from organochlorine compounds was examined in apopulation-based case-control study in British Columbia, Canada. Congeners ofPCBs and pesticides or pesticide metabolites were measured in plasma of 325 casesand 327 controls.RESULTS: Most organochlorine analytes showed a significant association with MM.The strongest association (highest vs lowest quartile) was oxychlordane(OR_=_7.44 95% CI_=_4.19-13.21). No heterogeneity was detected betweenorganochlorines levels and MM subtypes. Only oxychlordane and_-hexachlorocyclohexane (_-HCCH) were identified as significant independentpredictors of MM.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that organochlorines contribute to therisk of MM.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pharmacologic inhibition of AKT leads to cell death in relapsed multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29933047,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder with high diseaserecurrence rates. Novel therapeutic approaches capable of improving outcomes inpatients with MM are urgently required. The AKT signalling plays a criticalregulatory role in MM pathophysiology, including survival, proliferation,metabolism, and has emerged as a key therapeutic target. Here, we identified anovel AKT inhibitor, HS1793, and defined its mechanism of action and clinicalsignificance in MM. HS1793 disrupted the interaction between AKT and heat shockprotein 90, resulting in protein phosphatase 2A-modulated phosphorylated-AKT(p-AKT) reduction. Moreover, we observed reductions in the kinase activity of theAKT downstream target, I_B kinase alpha, and the transcriptional activity ofnuclear factor kappa B, which induced mitochondria-mediated cell death in MMcells exclusively. We confirmed the cytotoxicity and specificity of HS1793 viaPET-CT imaging of a metastatic mouse model generated using human MM cells. Wealso evaluated the cytotoxic effects of HS1793 in primary and relapsed MM cellsisolated from patients. Thus, HS1793 offers great promise in eliminating MM cellsand improving therapeutic responses in primary and relapsed/refractory MMpatients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Maintenance and continuous therapy for multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29932776,"INTRODUCTION: In multiple myeloma (MM), maintenance therapy is a longer and less intensive treatment course than initial therapy that is administered afterinduction to delay disease progression. Maintenance and continuous therapy havebeen shown to suppress minimal residual disease and deepen and prolong responses,with the goal of improving progression-free survival and overall survival. Areas covered: In this review, we have summarized current clinical trial data onmaintenance and continuous therapy in newly-diagnosed MM and relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), focusing on lenalidomide and bortezomib. We have also analyzed thepotential uses of newer agents, including carfilzomib, daratumumab, elotuzumab,and ixazomib. Expert commentary: Although lenalidomide- and bortezomib-containingregimens have demonstrated safety and efficacy, only lenalidomide is approved formaintenance, and it is the preferred agent in the National Comprehensive CancerNetwork and European Society for Medical Oncology myeloma guidelines.Furthermore, results from the FIRST trial support lenalidomide plus low-dosedexamethasone as a standard of care for continuous therapy. In RRMM, newer agentshave been successfully added to lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone; weawait data from additional trials. The vital roles of maintenance and continuous therapy and their benefits are clearly understood, but important questions remainregarding optimal duration of therapy and regimens.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Validation of multiple myeloma risk stratification indices in routine clinical practice: Analysis of data from the Czech Myeloma Group Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies.,/pubmed/29931775,"This study used data from the Czech Myeloma Group Registry of MonoclonalGammopathies to validate the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) andrevised International Staging System (R-ISS) indices for risk stratification inpatients with multiple myeloma (MM) in clinical practice. Patients were included if they had symptomatic MM, complete data allowing R-ISS and IMWG staging(including cytogenetic information regarding t(4;14), t(14;16), and del(17p)),and key parameters for treatment evaluation. Median overall survival (OS) inincluded patients (nÊ=Ê550) was 47.7 (95% CI: 39.5-55.9) and 46.2 (95% CI:38.9-53.5) months from diagnosis and initiation of first-line therapy,respectively. Patients categorized as higher vs lower risk had reduced survival; median OS from diagnosis was 35.4 (95% CI: 30.5-40.3) vs 58.3 (95% CI: 53.8-62.9)months in high-risk vs other patients (IMWG; PÊ=Ê.001) and 34.1 (95% CI:30.2-38.0) vs 47.2 (95% CI: 43.4-51.0) months in Stage III vs Stage II patients(R-ISS; PÊ<Ê.001).

Increased circulating CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells associate with early relapse following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma patients.,/pubmed/29930767,"We investigated dynamics of CD4+FOXP3+ T cell recovery following the high-dosechemotherapy (HDC) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(auto-HSCT) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Circulating CD4+FOXP3+ T cells of 79 MM patients were evaluated using flow cytometry before HDC with auto-HSCT, at the day of engraftment, and following 6 and 12 months. Percentage of CD4+FOXP3+ Tcells restored rapidly following auto-HSCT, became higher than pre-transplantlevel at the day of engraftment and then subsequently decreased for a year.CD4+FOXP3+ T cells at the time of engraftment were increased in patients with therelapse or progression of MM during 12 months following auto-HSCT (n=10) comparedto non-relapsed patients (n=50): 6.7% (5.3-8.9%) vs 4.9% (2.8-6.6%); PU = 0.026. Area under the curve was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.570-0.878; _=0.026). CirculatingCD4+FOXP3+ T cell count was not associated with the percentage of myeloma plasma cells in a bone marrow but depended on its amount in autografts.Conclusions:Relative count of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells restored rapidly following auto-HSCT (at theday of engraftment), became higher than pre-transplant level and thensubsequently decreased for a year. Their excess at the time of engraftment isassociated with early relapse.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Role of Tumor-Derived Chemokines in Osteolytic Bone Metastasis.,/pubmed/29930538,"Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients.The bone marrow is a common destination for many malignant cancers, includingbreast carcinoma (BC), prostate carcinoma, multiple myeloma, lung carcinoma,uterine cancer, thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. The molecular mechanism by which metastatic cancer are able to recognize, infiltrate, andcolonize bone are still unclear. Chemokines are small soluble proteins whichunder normal physiological conditions mediate chemotactic trafficking ofleukocytes to specific tissues in the body. In the context of metastasis, thebest characterized role for the chemokine system is in the regulation of primary tumor growth, survival, invasion, and homing to specific secondary sites.However, there is ample evidence that metastatic tumors exploit chemokines tomodulate the metastatic niche within bone which ultimately results in osteolytic bone disease. In this review, we examine the role of chemokines in metastatictumor growth within bone. In particular, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, IL-8/CXCL8,and CXCL12 are consistently involved in promoting osteoclastogenesis and tumorgrowth. We will also evaluate the suitability of chemokines as targets forchemotherapy with the use of neutralizing antibodies and chemokinereceptor-specific antagonists.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impaired efferocytosis by monocytes in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29928429,"Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells by efferocytosis is important for tissuehomeostasis. Impaired efferocytosis leads to the accumulation of cell debris,which is regarded as a trigger in chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.Patients with hematological neoplastic disorders such as multiple myeloma (MM)exhibit high blood levels of apoptotic microparticles. The present studyinvestigated whether these high levels of apoptotic microparticles are associatedwith insufficient dead cell clearance. Blood samples were collected from patientswith MM immediately prior to and 3, 7 and 10 days after the initial cycle ofbortezomib-based therapy. In addition, bone marrow aspirates (BMA) were collectedprior to and following therapy. Prior to therapy, a 52% reduction inefferocytosis by blood monocytes was observed compared with the healthy controls (P<0.017). This was associated with an elevated number of 7-AAD+ dead cellremnants in the blood flow as well as in BMA. A portion of the blood samplescontained active caspase 3. The subsequent bortezomib-based therapy had no effecton efferocytosis, although the quantity of dead cell remnants decreased. Thisreduction was associated with a decline in cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+and CD4+ T cells and an increase in the number of monocytes. However, of 28distinct soluble immune-modulating molecules (i.e. chemokines, cytokines andsoluble co-stimulators) only C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL24 and sCD27were affected by bortezomib-based therapy. The levels of all other moleculesremained unchanged or were below the detection threshold in all samples. Thepresent study results revealed that the presence of dead cell remnants in theblood and bone morrow of patients with MM is associated with impairedefferocytosis by monocytes; however, its contribution to inflammatory eventsduring MM remains unclear.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparative analysis of the surgical treatment results for multiple myeloma bone disease of the spine and the long bone/soft tissue.,/pubmed/29928372,"The present retrospective study was designed to compare the pain relief, surgery duration, life quality, survival time and relative prognostic factors in multiplemyeloma (MM) bone disease patients with different surgical sites. A total of 65cases were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A included patients withlesions located in the spine, while Group B included patients with lesionslocated in the long bone or soft tissue. Pain relief was measured by the visualanalogue scale (VAS), neurological impairment was determined according to Frankelclassification, and survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Coxregression analysis was also used to estimate the effect of factors on theprediction of survival. The hospitalization time, preoperative duration ofsymptoms, method of surgery, complications, recurrence and survival time wereevaluated and compared retrospectively. Pain relief and improvement of lifequality were observed in all the patients in groups A and B. No significantdifferences were detected for the majority of parameters compared between groups A and B, with the exception of the surgery duration, as well as the postoperativeVAS score at 1 and 6 months after surgery. The multivariate Cox regressionanalysis revealed several risk factors significantly associated with survival,including the preoperative VAS score, postoperative chemotherapy, prothrombintime activity (PTA), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase and urine protein level. Inconclusion, surgical treatment was an effective therapeutic method in patientswith MM. Postoperative analgesic use should be individualized according to thedifferent surgical sites and postoperative periods. Furthermore, preoperativepain, PTA, albumin, urine protein level and postoperative chemotherapy areassociated with prognosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Potent antitumor effect of combination therapy with sub-optimal doses of Akt inhibitors and pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29928335,"Afuresertib (AFU), a novel inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase AKT, hasclinical efficacy as a monotherapy against hematological malignancies and isexpected to be used in combination with standard therapies for multiple myeloma(MM). To develop a more effective and less toxic combination of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) for therapy, the antitumor effect of sub-optimal doses of AFU,pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (PD), and the AFU-PD combination on MM cells wereexamined in the present study. Two MM cell lines, XG-7 and U266, with lowsensitivity to both PD and AFU monotherapies, were subjected to thesecombinations and analyzed. Although the cell lines showed a slight reduction inviability with the sub-optimal doses of each monotherapy, the combination of the treatments resulted in a reduction in cell viability and the progression ofapoptosis. Co-treatment with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFU enhanced caspaseactivation and highly suppressed the expression of IKZF1 and IKZF3. In addition, this combination promoted the dephosphorylation and stabilization of 4EBP1, aninhibitor of eIF4E activation, which led to the impairment of eIF4E-mediatedtranslational activity. Furthermore, AFU showed a sufficient inhibitory effect onthe phosphorylation of FOXO1, a tumor suppressor, in monotherapy or incombination with PD, which may be attributable to the activation of FOXO1, thesubsequent inhibition of tumor growth, and the induction of cell death. Inconclusion, the combination therapy with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFUexhibited potent antitumor activity in MM cells and may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of patients who experienced intolerable toxicity orinsufficient response during IMiD therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Coding variants in NOD-like receptors: An association study on risk and survival of colorectal cancer.,/pubmed/29928061,"Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are important innate pattern recognition receptors and regulators of inflammation or play a role during development. We systematicallyanalysed 41 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 NLR genesin a Czech discovery cohort of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) (1237 cases, 787 controls) for their association with CRC risk and survival. Five SNPs were found to be associated with CRC risk and eight with survival at 5% significance level. In a replication analysis using data of two large genome-wide association studies(GWASs) from Germany (DACHS: 1798 cases and 1810 controls) and Scotland (2210cases and 9350 controls) the associations found in the Czech discovery set werenot confirmed. However, expression analysis in human gut-related tissues andimmune cells revealed that the NLRs associated with CRC risk or survival in thediscovery set were expressed in primary human colon or rectum cells, CRC tissueand/or cell lines, providing preliminary evidence for a potential involvement of NLRs in general in CRC development and/or progression. Most interesting was thefinding that the enigmatic development-related NLRP5 (also known as MATER) wasnot expressed in normal colon tissue but in colon cancer tissue and cell lines.Future studies may show whether regulatory variants instead of coding variantsmight affect the expression of NLRs and contribute to CRC risk and survival.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Preclinical characterization of INCB053914, a novel pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, alone and in combination with anticancer agents, in models of hematologic malignancies.",/pubmed/29927999,"The Proviral Integration site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM)serine/threonine protein kinases are overexpressed in many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies and play central roles in intracellular signaling networksimportant in tumorigenesis, including the Janus kinase-signal transducer andactivator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/AKT pathways. The three PIM kinase isozymes (PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3) sharesimilar downstream substrates with other key oncogenic kinases and have differingbut mutually compensatory functions across tumors. This supports the therapeutic potential of pan-PIM kinase inhibitors, especially in combination with otheranticancer agents chosen based on their role in overlapping signaling networks.Reported here is a preclinical characterization of INCB053914, a novel, potent,and selective adenosine triphosphate-competitive pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. Invitro, INCB053914 inhibited proliferation and the phosphorylation of downstreamsubstrates in cell lines from multiple hematologic malignancies. Effects wereconfirmed in primary bone marrow blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemiatreated ex vivo and in blood samples from patients receiving INCB053914 in anongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study. In vivo, single-agent INCB053914 inhibitedBcl-2-associated death promoter protein phosphorylation and dose-dependentlyinhibited tumor growth in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma xenografts.Additive or synergistic inhibition of tumor growth was observed when INCB053914was combined with selective PI3K_ inhibition, selective JAK1 or JAK1/2inhibition, or cytarabine. Based on these data, pan-PIM kinase inhibitors,including INCB053914, may have therapeutic utility in hematologic malignancieswhen combined with other inhibitors of oncogenic kinases or standardchemotherapeutics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
ARNT/HIF-1ë_ links high-risk 1q21 gain and microenvironmental hypoxia to drug resistance and poor prognosis in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29926531,"1q21 gain is a common cytogenetic abnormality featuring high-risk multiplemyeloma (HRMM). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the adverseprognostic effect of 1q21 gain remains largely unclear. Here, we report thatARNT/HIF-1_, a 1q21 gene, is highly expressed in HRMM and induced bymicroenvironmental hypoxia, which confers drug resistance and correlates withinferior outcome. Analysis of the gene expression profile database revealed that ARNT expression was upregulated in MM and increased with disease progression orin HRMM subtypes (particularly 1q21 gain), while correlated to shorter overallsurvival. In a cohort of 40 MM patients, qPCR further validated that ARNTexpression was higher in MM patients than normal donors. MM cells carrying 1q21gain or acquired drug resistance displayed a robust increase in HIF-1_ proteinlevel. Hypoxia induced HIF-1_ expression via a NF-_B-dependent process. Notably, HIF-1_ overexpression impaired bortezomib sensitivity, whereas shRNA knockdown ofARNT reversed hypoxia-mediated drug resistance. Together, these findings suggest that ARNT/HIF-1_ might represent a novel biomarker for risk stratification andprognosis of HRMM patients, as well as a potential therapeutic target forovercoming 1q21 gain- or microenvironment-mediated and acquired drug resistancein MM.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of microRNA-138 enhances bone formation in multiple myeloma bone marrow niche.,/pubmed/29925904,"Myeloma bone disease is a devastating complication of multiple myeloma (MM) andis caused by dysregulation of bone remodeling processes in the bone marrowmicroenvironment. Previous studies showed that microRNA-138 (miR-138) is anegative regulator of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells(MSCs) and that inhibiting its function enhances bone formation in vitro. In thisstudy, we explored the role of miR-138 in myeloma bone disease and evaluated the potential of systemically delivered locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modifiedanti-miR-138 oligonucleotides in suppressing myeloma bone disease. We showed thatexpression of miR-138 was significantly increased in MSCs from MM patients(MM-MSCs) and myeloma cells compared to those from healthy subjects. Furthermore,inhibition of miR-138 resulted in enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs in vitro and increased the number of endosteal osteoblastic lineage cells (OBCs) and bone formation rate in mouse models of myeloma bone disease. RNA sequencingof the OBCs identified TRPS1 and SULF2 as potential miR-138 targets that werede-repressed in anti-miR-138-treated mice. In summary, these data indicate thatinhibition of miR-138 enhances bone formation in MM and that pharmacologicalinhibition of miR-138 could represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment ofmyeloma bone disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Does Reinfusion of Stem Cell Products on Multiple Days Affect Engraftment?,/pubmed/29923493,"INTRODUCTION: High dose melphalan chemotherapy and autologous stem celltransplantation in multiple myeloma ( MM ) is still important treatment modality in transplant eligible patients. At least 2 x 106 /kg CD 34+ cell dose ispreferred for sufficient engraftment. Some patients need multiple leukapheresisprocedures to reach a required number of the CD34+ cell but this can cause highvolume of stem cell product that can not be given in a single day.AIM: Whether the number of infusion days affect engraftment or not, isn't studiedbefore. We want to evaluate the effect of reinfusion of stem cell in multiple dayon engraftment results. Demographic features, CD 34+ cell doses, neutrophil andplatelet engraftment days, hospitalization days, number of infusion days of 149autologous transplantation of 143 multiple myeloma patients were evaluatedretrospectively.RESULTS: The data of 143 multiple myeloma patients who were transplanted wereanalyzed retrospectively. Median age was 55 ± 8,5 (26-70) with 91/58 Male/Female ( M/F) ratio. The hospitalization day for all patients was 24 ± 6 (14-50) day.Mean CD 34+ cell number was 7,5 ±5,3 x 106/kg(1,5-31 x 106/kg). CD34+ cells were reinfused in one day in 80,5% (n: 120) of the patients, 2 days in 18,2% of thepatients (n: 27) and3 days in 1,3% of patients (n: 2). For 29 patients,reinfusion was performed in more than one day because of the high volume of stem cell product. We didn't see any dimethyl sulfoxide toxicity, cardiac arrhythmiaand volume overload complication. Hypertensive attack during infusion was easily controlled by frusemide infusion. In multiple infusions group, the infused CD34+ cell numbers were mean 4,8 ± 2,8x106/kg and in single infusion group, the infusedCD34+ cell numbers were mean 8,1 x106/kg ± 5,5 x106/kg. There were no statisticaldifferences between two groups regarding to platelet and neutrophil engraftmentdays ( p= 0.85 and p= 0.5 ). There was no statistical difference between twogroups for the hospitalization days ( p=0.06).CONCLUSION: In cases with high volume stem cell product to obtain sufficient stemcell, reinfusion can be safely applied over several days without any delay inengraftment.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Its tragic teratogenic effects culminated in withdrawal from the market. Since the discovery of its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory actions,thalidomide has been used in the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma, whichjustify studies of its stability. We investigated the effects of irradiation ofthalidomide up to 100_kGy (fourfold the usual sterilizing dose forpharmaceutics). The _ polymorph of thalidomide was obtained in an isothermalexperiment at 270_¡C. All samples underwent gamma irradiation for specific times.At different doses, decomposition of the pharmaceutical was not observed up to100_kGy. The observed effect was angle turning between the phthalimide andglutarimide rings modulated by repulsion towards the carbonyl group, leading to astable energetic configuration, as measured by the equilibrium in the torsionangle after irradiation. The thalidomide molecule has a center of symmetry, so a full turn starting from 57.3¡ will lead to an identical molecule. Furtherirradiation will start the process again. Samples irradiated at 30 and 100_kGyhave more compact unit cells and a lower volume, which leads to an increase inthe intermolecular hydrogen interaction within the unit cell, resulting in higherthermal stability for polymorph _.",N,,,,,,,,,,
CD56 Expression Is an Important Prognostic Factor in Multiple Myeloma Even with Bortezomib Induction.,/pubmed/29920491,"OBJECTIVES: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the impact of CD56, CD117, and CD28 expression on clinical characteristics and survival in newly diagnosedmyeloma patients treated with bortezomib-based induction therapy.METHODS: We analyzed 110 myeloma patients. Immunophenotype was determined usingpanels consisting of CD19/CD38/CD45/CD56/CD138 and CD20, CD28, and CD117 wereused additionally. All samples were tested for recurrent chromosomal aberrations.RESULTS: CD56, CD117, and CD28 expression rates were 71, 6, and 68%,respectively. The lack of CD56 expression was associated with light chainmyeloma. The lack of CD117 expression was associated with elevated creatininelevels (p = 0.037). We discovered the correlation between CD 28 expression andfemale gender. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients withrevised International Staging System stage 2 disease with CD56 expression or the lack of CD56 expression was 20.5 vs. 13.8 months (p = 0.03). In patientsundergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), we foundno difference in PFS and overall survival regarding the CD56 expression. We foundno impact of CD117 and CD28 expression on PFS in patients regarding aHSCT.CONCLUSIONS: Induction treatment incorporating bortezomib diminishes the negativeimpact of the lack of CD117 expression and aberrancy of CD28 but does notovercome the negative impact of the lack of CD56 expression.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pathophysiology of drug-induce peripheral neuropathy in patients with multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29920472,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of unknown, complex etiology that affectsprimarily older adults.

Clinical utility of bone markers in various diseases.,/pubmed/29920402,"Measurements of bone markers (BMs) in peripheral blood or urine are a pivotalpart of bone research within modern clinical medicine. In recent years the use ofBMs increased substantially as they can be useful either to diagnose bone(related) disease and to follow its natural history, but also to monitor theeffects of interventions. However, the use of BMs is still complicated mainly dueto (pre)analytical variability of these substances, limited accessibility ofassays, variable cut-off values in different countries and laboratories andheterogeneous results with regard to clinical implications of measuring BMs inseveral studies.

The clinician should consider fastingstate, recent fractures, aging, menopausal status, concomitant liver and kidneydisease when ordering and interpreting BM measurements as these factors mightresult in misleading BM concentrations. We found that BMs are clearly useful inthe current diagnosis of tumor induced osteomalacia, van Buchem disease, Paget's disease and hypophosphatemic rickets. In addition, BMs are useful to monitordisease activity in chronic kidney disease, Paget's disease and are useful tomonitor treatment adherence in osteoporosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Oncogenic TRK fusions are amenable to inhibition in hematologic malignancies.,/pubmed/29920189,"Rearrangements involving the neurotrophic receptor kinase genes (NTRK1, NTRK2,and NTRK3; hereafter referred to as TRK) produce oncogenic fusions in a widevariety of cancers in adults and children. Although TRK fusions occur in <1% ofall solid tumors, inhibition of TRK results in profound therapeutic responsesresulting in breakthrough FDA-approval of the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib foradult and pediatric solid tumor patients regardless of histology. In contrast to solid tumors, the frequency of TRK fusions and clinical effects of targeting TRK in hematologic malignancies is unknown. Here, through an evaluation for TRKfusions across > 7,000 patients with hematologic malignancies, we identified TRK fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),histiocytosis, multiple myeloma and dendritic cell neoplasms. Although TRKfusions occurred in only 0.1% of patients (8 out of 7,311 patients), theyconferred responsiveness to TRK inhibition in vitro and in vivo in apatient-derived xenograft and a corresponding AML patient with ETV6-NTRK2 fusion.These data identify that despite their individual rarity, collectively TRKfusions are present in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies and predictclinically significant therapeutic responses to TRK inhibition.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Molecular mechanism of Wnt signal pathway in multiple myeloma cell line H929 cell autophagy.,/pubmed/29917182,"OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic mechanism of multiple myeloma is still unclear yet.Abnormality in cell autophagy is closely correlated with various orthopedicdiseases especially multiple myeloma. Therefore, this study investigated themechanism of cell autophagy abnormality in multiple myeloma occurrence andclinical implications.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using multiple myeloma cell line H929 as the model, cells were treated with UV irradiation. Western blot was used to measure the autophagy of H929 cell, expression level of autophagy molecules and activation of autophagysignal pathway such as Wnt. Using autophagy activator, H929 cell autophagy waspotentiated, followed by quantification of autophagy molecular expression andsignal pathway such as Wnt activation. Agonist or antagonist of Wnt signalpathway was used to treat H929 cells followed by measuring autophagy moleculesand Wnt pathway activation. The correlation between Wnt signal pathway or cellautophagy and occurrence of multiple myeloma was analyzed.RESULTS: UV irradiation treatment on multiple myeloma cell line H929 inducedautophagy and Wnt signal pathway activation. The inhibitor of Wnt signal pathway suppressed UV-induced H929 cell autophagy. However, over-expression of Wnt signalpathway enhanced UV-mediated autophagy of H929 cells. The condition of Wntactivation and autophagy level were positively correlated.CONCLUSIONS: UV irradiation can induce autophagy of multiple myeloma cells,suggesting that management of cell autophagy might be one possible treatment for multiple myeloma.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Simvastatin reverses multiple myeloma serum-induced prothrombotic phenotype in endothelial cells via ERK 1/2 signalling pathway.,/pubmed/29916838,": The introduction of new agents in multiple myeloma therapy has increased theoverall response rate and improved clinical outcomes, but the increased risk ofthrombotic complications impairs the quality of life of patient and the optimalthromboprophylaxis remains unknown. Increasing evidence has shown that statinscan prevent venous thrombosis. Hence, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on multiple myeloma serum-related haemostatic imbalance in endothelial cells invitro. The effects of simvastatin on procoagulant and anticoagulant proteinexpression were assessed on mixed multiple myeloma serum-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The activity of these proteins was measured bythrombin generation and protein C activation assay. Then, the effects ofextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 on endothelial activation wereassessed by western blot and inhibition assay. We found that simvastatininhibited multiple myeloma serum-induced expression of procoagulant proteintissue factor and phosphatidylserine and generation of thrombin on HUVECs. Incontrast, simvastatin increased multiple myeloma serum-inhibited expression ofanticoagulant protein endothelial protein C receptor and activation of protein C on HUVECs. Moreover, simvastatin reversed the multiple myeloma serum-inducedprothrombotic phenotype, at least in part, via the inhibition of ERK 1/2activation in endothelial cells. This study supports the beneficial effects ofsimvastatin on multiple myeloma serum-induced endothelial haemostatic imbalance, which suggests that simvastatin may serve as a new and appropriate antithromboticapproach for multiple myeloma patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Three cases of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance after kidney transplantation. De novo C3 glomerulopathy.,/pubmed/29914760,"Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance includes all renal disorders causedby a monoclonal immunoglobulin secreted by a non-malignant B-cell clone.

Nevertheless, the renal involvement can be serious andrequire specific treatment. Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance isassociated with a wide spectrum of disorders, including the recently discoveredC3 glomerulopathy. Development of C3 glomerulopathy in the context of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance after kidney transplantation is uncommon andvery few cases have been published to date.

"A prospective observational study to assess clinical decision-making, prognosis, quality of life and satisfaction with care in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: the CLARITY study protocol.",/pubmed/29914509,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decision-making in patients with relapsed/refractorymultiple myeloma (RRMM) is challenging for a number of reasons including, theheterogeneity of disease at relapse and the number of possible therapeuticapproaches. This study broadly aims to generate new evidence-based data tofacilitate clinical decision-making in RRMM patients. The primary objective is toinvestigate the prognostic value of patient self-reported fatigue severity foroverall survival.METHODS: This multicenter prospective observational study will consecutivelyenroll 312 patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior lineof therapy and are considered as RRMM according to the International MyelomaWorking Group (IMWG) criteria. Eligible RRMM participants will be adults (³18Êyears old) patients and will be enrolled irrespective of comorbidities andperformance status. At the time of study inclusion, data to calculate the frailtyscore are to be available. Patients will be followed up for 30Êmonths andpatient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment is planned at baseline and thereafterat 3, 6, 12, and 24Êmonths. The following PRO validated questionnaires will beused: the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the EORTC QLQ-MY20 and the EORTCQLQ-INFO25. Satisfaction with care and preference for involvement in treatmentdecisions will also be evaluated. Clinical, laboratory and treatment relatedinformation will be prospectively collected in conjunction with pre scheduled PROassessments. Cox regression analyses will be used to assess the prognostic value of baseline fatigue severity (EORTC QLQ-C30) and other patient-reportedhealth-related quality of life parameters.DISCUSSION: Clinical decision-making in RRMM is a challenge and outcomeprediction is also an important aspect to enhance personalized treatmentplanning. Given the paucity of PRO data in this population, this prospectiveobservational study aims to provide novel information that may facilitatepatients' management in routine practice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as identifier NCT03190525 .",N,,,,,,,,,,
Tonsillar Plasmacytoma: clues on magnetic resonance imaging.,/pubmed/29914385,"BACKGROUND: Malignant plasma cell proliferation may present as a disseminateddisease (multiple myeloma), a solitary plasmacytoma of bone, or an extramedullaryplasmacytoma of soft tissue. The latter plasmacytomas represent approximately 3% of all plasma cell proliferations, and 80% develop in the head-and-neck region.The unexpected clinical presentation of such masses may be present.CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a rare case of primary tonsillar plasmacytoma in a 42-year-old female. The patient presented with asymmetric tonsillarhypertrophy that was resistant to antibiotherapy. Upon further workup, we foundno evidence of multiple myeloma or light-chain disease. The patient underwentsurgery and, at the last follow-up, exhibited no evidence of such disease.CONCLUSIONS: In adults presenting with asymptomatic tonsillar enlargement, thepossibility of submucosal masses should be considered, thus encouraging theradiologist to evaluate crypts within the palatine tonsil on a postcontrast MRI, besides enlargement and signal change.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Constitutive Activation of STAT3 in Myeloma Cells Cultured in a Three-Dimensional, Reconstructed Bone Marrow Model.",/pubmed/29914181,"Malignant cells cultured in three-dimensional (3D) models have been found to bephenotypically and biochemically different from their counterparts culturedconventionally. Since most of these studies employed solid tumor types, how 3Dculture affects multiple myeloma (MM) cells is not well understood. Here, wecompared MM cells (U266 and RPMI8226) in a 3D culture model with those inconventional culture. While the conventionally cultured cells were present insingle cells or small clusters, MM-3D cells grew in large spheroids. Wediscovered that STAT3 was the pathway that was more activated in 3D in both cell lines. The active form of STAT3 (phospho-STAT3 or pSTAT3), which was absent in MMcells cultured conventionally, became detectable after 1_2 days in 3D culture.This elevated pSTAT3 level was dependent on the 3D environment, since itdisappeared after transferring to conventional culture. STAT3 inhibition using a pharmacological agent, Stattic, significantly decreased the cell viability of MM cells and sensitized them to bortezomib in 3D culture. Using an oligonucleotidearray, we found that 3D culture significantly increased the expression of severalknown STAT3 downstream genes implicated in oncogenesis. Since most primary MMtumors are naturally STAT3-active, studies of MM in 3D culture can generateresults that are more representative of the disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
STAT3 Interactors as Potential Therapeutic Targets for Cancer Treatment.,/pubmed/29914167,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) mediate essentialsignaling pathways in different biological processes, including immune responses,hematopoiesis, and neurogenesis. Among the STAT members, STAT3 plays crucialroles in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. While STAT3activation is transient in physiological conditions, STAT3 becomes persistentlyactivated in a high percentage of solid and hematopoietic malignancies (e.g.,melanoma, multiple myeloma, breast, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers), thuscontributing to malignant transformation and progression. This makes STAT3 anattractive therapeutic target for cancers. Initial strategies aimed at inhibitingSTAT3 functions have focused on blocking the action of its activating kinases or sequestering its DNA binding ability. More recently, the diffusion ofproteomic-based techniques, which have allowed for the identification andcharacterization of novel STAT3-interacting proteins able to modulate STAT3activity via its subcellular localization, interact with upstream kinases, andrecruit transcriptional machinery, has raised the possibility to target suchcofactors to specifically restrain STAT3 oncogenic functions. In this article, wesummarize the available data about the function of STAT3 interactors in malignantcells and discuss their role as potential therapeutic targets for cancertreatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
CARs and other T cell therapies for MM: The clinical experience.,/pubmed/29909915,"Harnessing the endogenous immune system to eliminate malignant cells has longbeen an intriguing approach. After considerable success in the treatment ofB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified Tcells have entered early clinical evaluation in the field of multiple myeloma(MM). The choice of suitable non-CD19 target antigens is challenging and avariety of myeloma-associated surface molecules have been under preclinicalinvestigation. Most recent clinical protocols have focused on targeting B-cellmaturation antigen (BCMA), and early results are promising. The trials differ in receptor constructs, patient selection, dosing strategies and conditioningchemotherapy and will thus pave the way to eventually define the optimalparameters. Other sources for autologous T-cell therapy of MM includeaffinity-enhanced T-cell receptor-modified cells and marrow infiltratinglymphocytes. In summary, adoptive T-cell transfer for the treatment of MM isstill in its infancy, but if early response rates indicate durability, will be a paradigm changing therapeutic modality for the treatment of MM.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Final outcomes of escalated melphalan 280Ûämg/m(2) with amifostine cytoprotection followed autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma: high CR and VGPR rates do not translate into improved survival.,/pubmed/29907806,"The most common preparative regimen for autologous transplantation (ASCT) inmyeloma (MM) consists of melphalan 200_mg/m2 (MEL 200). Higher doses of melphalan220-260_mg/m2, although relatively well tolerated, have not shown significantimprovement in clinical outcomes. Several approaches have been pursued in thepast to improve CR rates, including poly-chemotherapy preparative regimens,tandem ASCT, consolidation, and/or maintenance therapy. Since there is a steepdose-response effect for intravenous melphalan, we evaluated an alternativesingle ASCT strategy using higher-dose melphalan at 280_mg/m2 (MEL 280) withamifostine as a cytoprotectant as the maximum tolerated dose determined in anearlier phase I dose escalation trial. We report the final long-term outcomes of MM patients who underwent conditioning with MEL 280 with amifostinecytoprotection followed by ASCT. Although the complete response rate was quitehigh in the era pre-dating the routine use of novel therapies (proteasomeinhibitors, immunomodulatory agents) (49%), the progression-free survival was adisappointing 22 months. The implications of this dichotomy between the excellentdepth of ASCT response and progression-free survival are discussed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Beyond maximum grade: modernising the assessment and reporting of adverse events in haematological malignancies.,/pubmed/29907552,"Tremendous progress in treatment and outcomes has been achieved across the whole range of haematological malignancies in the past two decades. Although cure ratesfor aggressive malignancies have increased, nowhere has progress been moreimpactful than in the management of typically incurable forms of haematologicalcancer. Population-based data have shown that 5-year survival for patients withchronic myelogenous and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, indolent B-cell lymphomas,and multiple myeloma has improved markedly. This improvement is a result ofsubstantial changes in disease management strategies in these malignancies.Several haematological malignancies are now chronic diseases that are treatedwith continuously administered therapies that have unique side-effects over time.In this Commission, an international panel of clinicians, clinical investigators,methodologists, regulators, and patient advocates representing a broad range ofacademic and clinical cancer expertise examine adverse events in haematologicalmalignancies. The issues pertaining to assessment of adverse events examined hereare relevant to a range of malignancies and have been, to date, underexplored in the context of haematology. The aim of this Commission is to improve toxicityassessment in clinical trials in haematological malignancies by criticallyexamining the current process of adverse event assessment, highlighting the need to incorporate patient-reported outcomes, addressing issues unique to stem-celltransplantation and survivorship, appraising challenges in regulatory approval,and evaluating toxicity in real-world patients. We have identified a range ofpriority issues in these areas and defined potential solutions to challengesassociated with adverse event assessment in the current treatment landscape ofhaematological malignancies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance and smoldering myeloma: Assessment and management of the elderly patients.,/pubmed/29907380,"Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is the most frequent plasma cell disorder that commonly affects elderly patients. Although it is anasymptomatic condition, as well as smoldering myeloma (SMM), the risk ofprogression to multiple myeloma requiring therapy or other B-cell disordersvaries greatly for individual patients, remaining low for MGUS (1% per year),while higher and not uniform for SMM patients (10% per year). This scenarioimplies some special considerations regarding assessment and follow-up,especially in the elderly. In this review, we provide the updated diagnosticcriteria of monoclonal gammopathies proposed by the International Myeloma WorkingGroup (IMGW); the current recommendations for the assessment of asymptomaticplasma cell disorders, with some concerns about the need of geriatric evaluation in the elderly population, the importance of distinguishing myeloma-relatedsymptomatology from signs or symptoms caused by multiple chronic conditionstypically found in the elderly. Finally, the identification of predictor markers of progression has enabled a proposal of risk-adapted follow-up strategies inMGUS and SMM that should be implemented in clinical practice. Although thestandard of care is observation for MGUS and SMM patients as well, a recentrandomized trial targeting high-risk SMM showed the clinical benefit of earlyintervention. The change of the treatment paradigm is also very promising andfeasible for elderly patients, as long as a comprehensive geriatric assessment isconducted to optimize early treatment and reach maximum benefit with minimumtoxicity, in other words, to ensure a better quality of life for these patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Nanobody-based dual epitopes protein identification (DepID) assay for measuring soluble CD38 in plasma of multiple myeloma patients.,/pubmed/29907292,"BACKGROUND: CD38 is a surface membrane antigen highly expressed in malignantblood cells, such as multiple myeloma (MM). A soluble form of CD38 (sCD38) isalso present in the plasma, deriving likely from the shedding from the cells. Theplasma levels of sCD38 should thus correlate closely with the proliferation ofthe MM cells, allowing the development of a simple diagnostic blood test formonitoring the progress of the disease. However, the plasma sCD38 levels areextremely low, requiring the design of a highly sensitive and specific assay.RESULTS: In this study, we developed an ultra-sensitive assay, based on twonanobodies (Nbs) targeting two distinct epitopes of sCD38. One Nb acts as acapturer, and the other is fused with the firefly luciferase serving as areporter to ensure sensitivity. We showed that this Dual epitopes proteinIDentification (DepID) assay has sensitivity reaching 10_pg/mL, which is 10 timeshigher than that of a commercial ELISA kit. By this method, we were able toprecisely quantify the levels of sCD38 in the plasma of MM patients, which weresignificantly higher than those from healthy donors. We further showed that theincrease plasma levels of sCD38 correlated with the progress of MM.CONCLUSION: We have developed a Nb-based luminescence sandwich assay, named asDepID, for quantification of the soluble CD38 in MM patients' plasma and showedthe potency of this method as a tool for general diagnosis of MM or companiondiagnosis of the CD38-targeted therapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Screening and characterization of a Annenix A2 binding aptamer that inhibits the proliferation of myeloma cells.,/pubmed/29906496,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disease and is consideredincurable. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is closely related to the proliferation andadhesion of MM. Using protein-SELEX, we performed a screen for aptamers that bindGST-ANXA2 from a library, and GST protein was used for negative selection. Theenrichment of the ssDNA pool was monitored by filter-binding assay duringselection. After nine rounds of screening and high-throughput sequencing, weobtained six candidate aptamers that bind to the ANXA2 protein. The affinities ofthe candidate aptamers for ANXA2 were determined by ELONA. Binding of aptamer wh6to the ANXA2 protein and to the MM cell was verified by aptamer pulldownexperiment and flow cytometry, respectively. Aptamer wh6 binds the ANXA2 protein with good stability and has a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. Thebinding specificity of aptamer wh6 was confirmed in vivo in nude mouse xenograftswith MM cells and with MM bone marrow aspirates. Furthermore, aptamer wh6 canblock MM cell adhesion to ANXA2 and block the proliferation of MM cells inducedby ANXA2. In summary, wh6 can be considered a promising candidate tool for MMdiagnosis and treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The human biomolecular corona of liposomal doxorubicin: The overlooked factor in anticancer drug delivery.,/pubmed/29905462,"More than twenty years after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) is still the drug of choice for the treatmentof breast cancer and other conditions such as ovarian cancer and multiplemyeloma. Yet, despite the efforts, liposomal DOX did not satisfy expectations at the clinical level. When liposomal drugs enter a physiological environment, theirsurface gets coated by a dynamic biomolecular corona (BC). The BC changesliposome's synthetic identity, providing it with a new one, referred to as'biological identity' (size, aggregation state, and BC composition). Today, theconcept is emerging that specific BCs may determine either success (e.g. stealth effect and accumulation at the target site) or failure (e.g. rapid bloodclearance, off-target interactions) of liposomal drugs. To get a comprehensiveinvestigation of liposome synthetic identity, biological identity and cellularresponse as a function of human plasma (HP) concentration, here we used astraightforward combination of quantitative analytical and imaging tools,including dynamic light scattering (DLS), micro-electrophoresis (ME), synchrotronsmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),fluorescence life-time imaging microscopy (FLIM), nano-liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS), confocal microscopy, flow cytometry andcell viability assays. Doxoves¨ was selected as a reference. Following exposureto HP, Doxoves¨ was surrounded by a complex BC that changed liposome's synthetic identity. Observations made with nano-LC MS/MS revealed that the BC of Doxoves¨did not evolve as a function of HP concentration and was poorly enriched oftypical 'opsonins' (Complement proteins, Immunoglobulins etc.). This provides apossible explanation for the prolonged blood circulation of liposomal DOX. On theother hand, flow cytometry showed that protein binding reduced internalization ofDOX in MCF7 and MDA-MB-435S human breast carcinoma. Combining FLIM and TEMexperiments, we clarified that reduction in DOX intracellular content was likely due to frequent rupture of the liposome membrane and consequent leakage of thecargo. In light of reported results, we are prompted to speculate that a detailedunderstanding of BC formation, composition, and effects on liposome stability anduptake is an indispensable task of future research in the field, especially alongthe way to clinical translation of liposomal drugs.",N,,,,,,,,,,

The synthetic analogues were tested on multiplemyeloma (MM) cell lines showing that the configuration at C-16 slightly affectsthe activity, since the 16-epi-derivative is still active at nanomolarconcentrations. Interestingly, it was found that the truncated compound 8, mainlycomposed of the pyrrolinone terminus, was not active, while compound 13,essentially lacking the pyrrolinone moiety, was 1000-fold less active than theintact substance and was the most active among all the synthesized compounds.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Linking transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity through allele analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.,/pubmed/29898899,"Characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity is critical to cancer therapy, as presence of phenotypically diverse cell populations commonly fuels relapse andresistance to treatment. Although genetic variation is a well-studied source ofintratumoral heterogeneity, the functional impact of most genetic alterationsremains unclear. Even less understood is the relative importance of other factorsinfluencing heterogeneity, such as epigenetic state or tumor microenvironment. Toinvestigate the relationship between genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity ina context of cancer progression, we devised a computational approach calledHoneyBADGER to identify copy number variation and loss-of-heterozygosity inindividual cells from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. By integrating allele and normalized expression information, HoneyBADGER is able to identify and infer the presence of subclone-specific alterations in individual cells and reconstructunderlying subclonal architecture. Examining several tumor types, we show thatHoneyBADGER is effective at identifying deletion, amplifications, andcopy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events, and is capable of robustlyidentifying subclonal focal alterations as small as 10 megabases. We furtherapply HoneyBADGER to analyze single cells from a progressive multiple myelomapatient to identify major genetic subclones that exhibit distinct transcriptionalsignatures relevant to cancer progression. Surprisingly, other prominenttranscriptional subpopulations within these tumors did not line up with thegenetic subclonal structure, and were likely driven by alternative, non-clonalmechanisms. These results highlight the need for integrative analysis tounderstand the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer.",N,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the nutritional profile, we collectedanthropometric data on weight, height, waist circumference upon hospitaladmission. The body mass index and the conicity index were calculated.RESULTS: A total of 91 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Hodgkin'slymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other conditions were evaluated. The meanage was 43.5 (14.2) years, 63.7% were male. We verified that according to thebody mass index, 63.7% were overweight and, according to waist circumference,74.7% had a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases. According to the calculationof the conicity index, 92.3% of patients presented increased cardiovascular risk.Patients with multiple myeloma had a higher conicity index when compared to otherpatients (p<0.01).CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of overweight andcardiovascular risk.

Association Between Autologous Stem Cell Transplant and Survival Among Californians With Multiple Myeloma.,/pubmed/29897481,"Background: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) is anefficacious treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. However, as rapid advances have resulted in other highly efficacious and less intensivetherapies, the role of aHSCT has been questioned.Methods: We utilized population-based data to identify 13 494 newly diagnosedpatients younger than age 80 years between 1998 and 2012. Patient characteristicsof aHSCT and non-aHSCT groups were balanced using inverse probability weightingof a propensity score predicting aHSCT use. Multivariable models adjusted forbaseline comorbidities, demographics, and socioeconomic status estimated theadjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of death.Results: Twenty point eight percent (2807) of patients underwent aHSCT, and this rate increased over time from 15.4% in 1998-2002 to 23.9% in 2008-2012. aHSCT wasutilized among 37.6% and 11.5% of patients younger than age 60 years and 60 to 79years, respectively. The median time to aHSCT was 9.4 months, and 89% of allaHSCTs occurred within two years of diagnosis. The median overall survival fromtime of aHSCT was 72.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68 to 78).Autologous HSCT at any time was associated with improved survival (aHR = 0.83,95% CI = 0.75 to 0.92). Among aHSCT recipients, transplant more than 12 monthsafter diagnosis (vs ²12 months) was associated with worse survival (aHR = 1.33,95% CI = 1.16 to 1.51). The positive effect of aHSCT on overall survival wassimilar across study time periods and age groups.Conclusion: In the era of highly efficacious induction therapies, aHSCT remained infrequently used but continued to be associated with improved survival formultiple myeloma patients and should be considered for newly diagnosed patients.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Exosome-mediated transfer of lncRUNX2-AS1 from multiple myeloma cells to MSCs contributes to osteogenesis.,/pubmed/29895968,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the decreased osteogenic potential ofmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Communication between cancer cells and cancerstromal cells is a driving factor in tumor progression. Understanding themyeloma-stroma interactions is critical to the development of effectivestrategies that can reverse bone diseases. Here we identified that bioactivelncRNA RUNX2-AS1 in myeloma cells could be packed into exosomes and transmittedto MSCs, thus repressing the osteogenesis of MSCs. RUNX2-AS1, which arises fromthe antisense strand of RUNX2, was enriched in MSCs derived from MM patients(MM-MSCs). RUNX2-AS1 was capable of forming an RNA duplex with RUNX2 pre-mRNA at overlapping regions and this duplex transcriptionally repressed RUNX2 expression by reducing the splicing efficiency, resulting in decreased osteogenic potential of MSCs. In vivo mouse models, administered an inhibitor of exosome secretion,GW4869, was found to be effective in preventing bone loss, sustained by both boneformation and anticatabolic activities. Therefore, exosomal lncRNA RUNX2-AS1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for bone lesions in MM. In summary, ourresults indicated a key role of exosomal lncRUNX2-AS1 in transferring from MMcells to MSCs in osteogenic differentiation, through a unique exosomallncRUNX2-AS1/RUNX2 pathway.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple myeloma clonal evolution in homogeneously treated patients.,/pubmed/29895955,"Clonal evolution drives tumor progression, chemoresistance and relapse in cancer.Little is known about clonal selection induced by therapeutic pressure inmultiple myeloma. To address this issue, we performed large targeted sequencingof bone marrow plasma cells in 43 multiple myeloma patients at diagnosis and atrelapse from exactly the same intensive treatment. The most frequently mutatedgenes at diagnosis were KRAS (35%), NRAS (28%), DIS3 (16%), BRAF, and LRP1B (12% each). At relapse, the mutational burden was unchanged. Many of the mutationswere present at the subclonal level at both time points, including driver ones.According to patients and mutations, we observed different scenarios: selectionof a very rare subclone present at diagnosis, appearance, or disappearance ofmutations, but also stability. Our data highlight that chemoresistance andrelapse could be induced by newly acquired mutations in myeloma drivers but also by (sub)clonal mutations preexisting to the treatment. Importantly, no specificmutation or rearrangement was observed at relapse, demonstrating that intensivetreatment has a nonspecific effect on clonal selection in multiple myeloma.Finally, we identified 22 cases of biallelic event, including a double eventdeletion 17p/TP53mut.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Risk stratification of smoldering multiple myeloma incorporating revised IMWG diagnostic criteria.,/pubmed/29895887,"In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group reclassified patients withsmoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) and bone marrow-plasma cell percentage(BMPC%)_³_60%, or serum free light chain ratio (FLCr)_³_100 or >1 focal lesion onmagnetic resonance imaging as multiple myeloma (MM).

Arterial hypertension and multiple myeloma: physiopathology and cardiovascular risk and 'practical' indications in patients receiving carfilzomib.,/pubmed/29886833,"The introduction of carfilzomib in the treatment of relapsing and refractorymultiple myeloma has allowed a significant increase in survival. The mostfrequent adverse effect of Carfilzomib treatment is arterial hypertension, eventhought the exact physiopathological mechanism are still unclear. MM patients, onthe other hand, often present significant cardiovascular risk factors andcomorbidities. Uncontrolled hypertension is frequently the cause ofcardiovascular complications. It has been estimated that up to 50% of subjects inthe general population are unaware of their hypertensive condition and only half of those who are aware of this risk factor present good control of bloodpressure. Although the management of arterial hypertension is clearly importantin reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, and is well described by thecurrent guidelines, no clear indications are provided on how to approach andtreat specifically MM patients undergoing treatment with proteasome inhibitors.The aim of our work is to summarize a practical approach to the stratification ofcardiovascular risk of hypertensive in patients who are candidates for oractively treated with carfilzomib for refractory multiple myeloma (MMR).

A transcriptomic signature predicting septic outcome in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.,/pubmed/29885947,"Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is a standardtreatment in multiple myeloma and relapsed or refractory lymphomas. Afterauto-HSCT, hematologic reconstitution and infectious complications are the maintwo critical issues. Though many patients develop infectious complications after therapeutic intensification, it remains impossible to predict infection for each individual. The goal of this work was to determine and identify a predictivetranscriptomic signature of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/orsepsis in patients receiving auto-HSCT. High throughput transcriptomic andbioinformatics analysis were performed to analyze gene expression modulation inperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 21 patients undergoing auto-HSCTfor hematological malignancies (lymphoma or multiple myeloma [MM]).Transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs samples collected just after conditioningregimen identified an eleven genes signature (CHAT, CNN3, ANKRD42, LOC100505725, EDAR, GPAT2, ENST00000390425, MTRM8, C6orf192 and LOC10289230 and XLOC-005643)that was able to early predict (at least 2 to 7 days before its occurrence) thedevelopment of SIRS or sepsis.

Clinical Course of a Patient With Kidney Failure Due to Isolated Bilateral Renal Extramedullary Plasmacytomas.,/pubmed/29885924,"Plasmacytomas are rare immunoproliferative monoclonal plasma cell diseases oflymphoid lineage that may present in an isolated or systemic manner. Systemicinvolvement is much more common than occurrences isolated to a particular organ, and for this reason, it is imperative to rule out systemic involvement forosseous and nonosseous isolated neoplasms. These neoplasms present uniquechallenges due to their location, extent of involvement, vague presentation, and dearth of treatment protocol. We report the case of a 69-year-old man whodeveloped chronic kidney disease stage 4 between 2009 and 2012. Precipitouskidney failure, anorexia, fatigue, and flank pain necessitated clinical follow-upthat ultimately led to thorough imaging and bilateral kidney biopsy. Proteinelectrophoresis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were all consistentwith bilateral renal extramedullary plasmacytomas. Treatment recommendations are often limited to prior case successes; however, chemotherapy, radiation, andsurgery are the mainstay of treatment. Although surgery or combined therapyprovides the best results for patients, such options are unfeasible withbilateral kidney involvement. Therefore, a chemotherapy regimen, similar to that for multiple myeloma, was determined to be most reasonable. Treatment consistedof 4 cycles of a bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone regimen. Threemonths following chemotherapy, kidney function returned to baseline levels.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reference intervals and diagnostic ranges for serum free ë¼ and free ëÈ immunoglobulin light chains vary by instrument platform: Implications for classification of patient results in a multi-center study.,/pubmed/29885308,"BACKGROUND: Serum free light chain (FLC) immunoglobulins are key biomarkers that aid in the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of treatment response in patients with plasma cell disorders (PCD). Here we investigated the transference ofmanufacturer's reported _FLC, _FLC and _ to _ FLC reference intervals (RI) andestablished de novo FLC RI and diagnostic ranges on four instruments at threeacademic medical centers. In addition, we also compared the classification ofpatient FLC results using manufacturer's versus established RIs and diagnosticranges.METHODS: CLSI EP28-A3C protocol was applied to investigate transference andestablishment of FLC reference intervals on the cobas (Roche), Immage (Beckman), Optilite and SPA Plus (Binding Site). Serum _ FLC and _ FLC were measured inreference sera (N_=_126) with estimation of central 95% RIs and FLC ratiodiagnostic range (total range). Frequencies (%) in patient FLC results (N_>_380per institution) classified above, below or within manufacturer's versusestablished FLC RI were compared.RESULTS: Three of four instrument platforms did not exhibit acceptabletransference of manufacturer's reported _ÊFLC RI. The manufacturer's reported FLCtotal diagnostic range did not encompass all values observed in reference serafor any of the four platforms evaluated. Established FLC ratio diagnostic ranges reduced the frequency of patient results classified above range for three of fourplatforms evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: Transference of manufacturer's reported FLC RIs may be inappropriatefor select instrument platforms. De novo establishment of FLC RIs specific toinstrument platform is highly recommended in order to assure correct patientresult classification.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Identification of novel mutational drivers reveals oncogene dependencies in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29884741,"Understanding the profile of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations withtheir interactions and impact on the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) canimprove the definition of disease subsets and identify pathways important indisease pathobiology. Using integrated genomics of 1,273 newly diagnosed patientswith multiple myeloma we identify 63 driver genes, some of which are novelincluding IDH1, IDH2, HUWE1, KLHL6, and PTPN11 Oncogene mutations aresignificantly more clonal than tumor suppressor mutations, indicating they mayexert a bigger selective pressure. Patients with more mutations in driver genesare associated with a worse outcome, as are those with identified mechanisms ofgenomic instability. Oncogenic dependencies were identified between mutations in driver genes, common regions of copy number change, and primary translocation andhyperdiploidy events. These dependencies included associations with t(4;14) andmutations in FGFR3, DIS3 and PRKD2; t(11;14) with mutations in CCND1 and IRF4;t(14;16) with mutations in MAF, BRAF, DIS3 and ATM; and hyperdiploidy with gain11q, mutations in FAM46C and MYC rearrangements. These associations indicate thatthe genomic landscape of myeloma is pre-determined by the primary events uponwhich further dependencies are built, giving rise to a non-random accumulation ofgenetic hits. Understanding these dependencies may elucidate potentialevolutionary patterns and lead to better treatment regimens.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Co-fuse: a new class discovery analysis tool to identify and prioritize recurrent fusion genes from RNA-sequencing data.,/pubmed/29882166,"Recurrent oncogenic fusion genes play a critical role in the development ofvarious cancers and diseases and provide, in some cases, excellent therapeutictargets. To date, analysis tools that can identify and compare recurrent fusiongenes across multiple samples have not been available to researchers. To address this deficiency, we developed Co-occurrence Fusion (Co-fuse), a new and easy touse software tool that enables biologists to merge RNA-seq information, allowing them to identify recurrent fusion genes, without the need for exhaustive dataprocessing. Notably, Co-fuse is based on pattern mining and statistical analysis which enables the identification of hidden patterns of recurrent fusion genes. Inthis report, we show that Co-fuse can be used to identify 2 distinct groupswithin a set of 49 leukemic cell lines based on their recurrent fusion genes: amultiple myeloma (MM) samples-enriched cluster and an acute myeloid leukemia(AML) samples-enriched cluster. Our experimental results further demonstrate thatCo-fuse can identify known driver fusion genes (e.g., IGH-MYC, IGH-WHSC1) in MM, when compared to AML samples, indicating the potential of Co-fuse to aid thediscovery of yet unknown driver fusion genes through cohort comparisons.Additionally, using a 272 primary glioma sample RNA-seq dataset, Co-fuse was ableto validate recurrent fusion genes, further demonstrating the power of thisanalysis tool to identify recurrent fusion genes. Taken together, Co-fuse is apowerful new analysis tool that can be readily applied to large RNA-seq datasets,and may lead to the discovery of new disease subgroups and potentially new drivergenes, for which, targeted therapies could be developed.

Dual-energy CT of the bone marrow in multiple myeloma: diagnostic accuracy for quantitative differentiation of infiltration patterns.,/pubmed/29882069,"OBJECTIVES: Bone marrow imaging patterns in patients with multiple myelomapossess prognostic and potential therapeutic relevance. We aim to evaluatewhether different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns also result indifferent bone marrow dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) virtual non-calcium (VNCa) attenuation values.METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study. Written informedconsent was obtained from all participants. 53 patients with plasma celldisorders (24 with normal imaging pattern, 24 with focal infiltration, 5 withdiffuse infiltration) and 21 control subjects sequentially underwent DECT and MRIof the axial skeleton. MRI served as reference standard for imaging patternassessment. Bone marrow VNCa attenuation numbers were obtained according topattern allocation. Generalised estimating equations and a receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) analysis were performed.RESULTS: Mean VNCa attenuation numbers in patients with normal, focal and diffuseimaging patterns were - 65.8 HU, 3.3 HU and - 13.3 HU, respectively. We foundsignificant differences between diffuse vs. normal (p < 0.001), diffuse vs. focal(p = 0.002) and normal vs. focal (p < 0.001) patterns. A cut-off of - 35.7 HUshowed a sensitivity of 100% (24/24) and specificity of 97% (116/120) for theidentification of a diffuse pattern vs. normal pattern, with an area under theROC curve of 0.997.CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow VNCa attenuation numbers of various imaging patterns in patients with plasma cell disorders differ significantly and a diffuse imagingpattern can be determined confidently using DECT, when ROIs are carefullyselected on the basis of MRI findings.KEY POINTS: ¥ DECT allows for imaging pattern allocation similar to MRI. ¥ Bonemarrow VNCa attenuation numbers differ significantly depending on the imagingpattern. ¥ A diffuse imaging pattern can be determined confidently using DECT.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impaired mitochondrial activity explains platelet dysfunction in thrombocytopenic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.,/pubmed/29880611,"Severe thrombocytopenia (²50x109 platelets/L) due to hematological malignancy andintensive chemotherapy is associated with an increased risk of clinicallysignificant bleeding. Since the bleeding risk is not linked to the platelet countonly, other hemostatic factors must be involved. In 77 patients with acuteleukemia, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma, who experiencedchemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, we studied platelet function. Plateletsfrom all patients - independent of disease or treatment type - were to a variableextent compromised in Ca2+ flux, integrin _IIb_3 activation and P-selectinexpression, when stimulated with a panel of agonists. The patients' plateletswere also impaired in spreading on fibrinogen. Whereas the Ca2+ store content wasunaffected, the patients' platelets showed ongoing phosphatidylserine (PS)exposure, which was not due to apoptotic caspase activity. Interestingly,mitochondrial function was markedly reduced in platelets from a representativesubset of patients, as evidenced by a low mitochondrial membrane potential(p<0.001) and low oxygen consumption (p<0.05), while the mitochondrial contentwas normal. Moreover, the mitochondrial impairments coincided with elevatedlevels of reactive oxygen species (Spearman's rho=-0.459, p=0.012). Markedly, theimpairment of platelet function only appeared after two days of chemotherapy,suggesting origination in the megakaryocytes. In patients with bone marrowrecovery, platelet function improved. In conclusion, our findings disclosedefective receptor signaling related to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics,independent of apoptosis, in platelets from cancer patients treated withchemotherapy, explaining the low hemostatic potential of these patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We thereforestudied the non-physiological, false-positive uptake of 18F-FDOPA in a largepopulation of patients with a NET or with a high clinical suspicion of harboring a NET.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective single-centre study among adult patients inwhom 18F-FDOPA PET scintigraphy was performed between January 2004 and December2014. The original scan report was compared with the original pathology reportcorresponding with the 18F-FDOPA PET-positive lesion. In case this wasinconsistent with the diagnosis of a NET, both the scan and the pathology slides were reassessed. Specimens of these non-NET tissues were immunohistochemicallystained for AADC.RESULTS: 1070 18F-FDOPA PET scans from 705 patients were evaluated. Focal ormultiple 18F-FDOPA avid lesions were described in 709 18F-FDOPA PET scans (66%). Histology of these 18F-FDOPA PET positive lesions was present in 508 (72%) cases.In seven cases the histopathology was not compatible with NET but showed squamouscell carcinoma of the cervix, multiple myeloma(two cases), hepatocellularcarcinoma, schwannoma, adrenocortical carcinoma and a skeletal myxoidchondrosarcoma, with positive immunohistochemical staining for AADC in 67%.CONCLUSIONS: Pathological uptake of 18F-FDOPA does not always indicate thepresence of a NET. The possibility of 18F-FDOPA uptake by tumor types other than NETs, although rare, should be considered.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Current Status and Future Prospects of Small-Molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Inhibitors of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Receptor Activator of NF-ë¼B Ligand (RANKL).,/pubmed/29875003,"The overexpression of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is directly related to thedevelopment of several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid and psoriaticarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, refractory asthma, andmultiple sclerosis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)belongs to the TNF family, and is the primary mediator of osteoclast-induced boneresorption through interaction with its receptor RANK. The function of RANKL isphysiologically inhibited by the action of osteoprotegerin (OPG), which is adecoy receptor that binds to RANKL and prevents the process ofosteoclastogenesis. Malfunction among RANK/RANKL/OPG can also result in bone lossdiseases, including postmenopausal osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bonemetastasis and multiple myeloma. To disrupt the unwanted functions of TNF andRANKL, current attempts focus on blocking TNF and RANKL binding to theirreceptors. In this review, we present the research efforts toward the developmentof low-molecular-weight pharmaceuticals that directly block the detrimentalactions of TNF and RANKL.",N,,,,,,,,,,

"Cancer Metastases to Bone: Concepts, Mechanisms, and Interactions with Bone Osteoblasts.",/pubmed/29867053,"The skeleton is a unique structure capable of providing support for the body.Bone resorption and deposition are controlled in a tightly regulated balancebetween osteoblasts and osteoclasts with no net bone gain or loss. However, underconditions of disease, the balance between bone resorption and deposition isupset. Osteoblasts play an important role in bone homeostasis by depositing newbone osteoid into resorption pits. It is becoming increasingly evident thatosteoblasts additionally play key roles in cancer cell dissemination to bone and subsequent metastasis. Our laboratory has evidence that when osteoblasts comeinto contact with disseminated breast cancer cells, the osteoblasts producefactors that initially reduce breast cancer cell proliferation, yet promotecancer cell survival in bone. Other laboratories have demonstrated thatosteoblasts both directly and indirectly contribute to dormant cancer cellreactivation in bone. Moreover, we have demonstrated that osteoblasts undergo an inflammatory stress response in late stages of breast cancer, and produceinflammatory cytokines that are maintenance and survival factors for breastcancer cells and osteoclasts.

Fluorescent in situhybridisation (FISH) of the testicular tissue noted mutations which had not been present in the FISH analysis of bone marrow. Positron emission tomography scanlater revealed new retroperitoneal plasmacytomas involving the new clone and his chemotherapy regimen needed to be adjusted for treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long non-coding RNA FEZF1-AS1 promotes cell growth in multiple myeloma via miR-610/Akt3 axis.,/pubmed/29864963,"Increasing evidence showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play criticalroles in tumor progression. FEZF1-AS1 is a cancer-associated lncRNA whichupregulated and associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. However, the roles of FEZF1-AS1 in multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear. In the presentstudy, our data revealed that FEZF1-AS1 expression was increased both in MMsamples and cell lines. Loss of functional assays indicated that FEZF1-AS1suppression inhibited MM cells proliferation, arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, our data indicated thatFEZF1-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA in MM cells that regulatedmiR-610 expression, which suppressed Akt3. Those data showed that FEZF1-AS1promoted MM cells proliferation through regulating miR-610/Akt3 axis, suggesting FEZF1-AS1 could be served as a potential target for cancer therapeutics in MM.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Destabilizing NEK2 overcomes resistance to proteasome inhibition in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29863498,"Drug resistance remains the key problem in cancer treatment. It is now acceptedthat each myeloma patient harbors multiple subclones and subclone dominance maychange over time. The coexistence of multiple subclones with high or lowchromosomal instability (CIN) signature causes heterogeneity and drug resistance with consequent disease relapse. In this study, using a tandem affinitypurification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) technique, we found that NEK2, a CINgene, was bound to the deubiquitinase USP7. Binding to USP7 prevented NEK2ubiquitination resulting in NEK2 stabilization. Increased NEK2 kinase levelsactivated the canonical NF-_B signaling pathway through the PP1_/AKT axis. Newly diagnosed myeloma patients with activated NF-_B signaling through increased NEK2 activity had poorer event-free and overall survivals based on multipleindependent clinical cohorts. We also found that NEK2 activated heparanase, asecreted enzyme, responsible for bone destruction in an NF-_B-dependent manner.Intriguingly, both NEK2 and USP7 inhibitors showed great efficacy in inhibitingmyeloma cell growth and overcoming NEK2-induced and -acquired drug resistance in xenograft myeloma mouse models.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The adipose organ and multiple myeloma: Impact of adipokines on tumor growth and potential sites for therapeutic intervention.,/pubmed/29859797,"In addition to its capacity to store lipids the adipose tissue is now identified as a real organ with both endocrine and metabolic roles. Preclinical resultsindicate that modifying adipose tissue and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT)could be a successful multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. BMAT interrelates with bone marrow cells and other immune cells, and may influence MM disease progression.The BM adipocytes may have a role in MM progression, bone homing,chemoresistance, and relapse, due to local endocrine, paracrine, or metabolicfactors. BM adipocytes isolated from MM subjects have been shown to increasemyeloma growth in vitro and may preserve cells from chemotherapy-inducedapoptosis. By producing free fatty acids and emitting signaling molecules such asgrowth factors and adipokines, BM adipocytes are both an energy font and anendocrine signaling factory. This review should suggest future researchapproaches toward developing novel treatments to target MM by targeting BMAT and its products.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cellular immunotherapy as a therapeutic approach in multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29856648,"INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy seeks to restore and augment the unique ability ofthe immune system to recognize and kill malignant cells. This strategy haspreviously been incorporated into standard of care in myeloma with the use ofimmunomodulatory drugs and allogeneic transplant. The following review willdiscuss the rationale for immunotherapy to reverse critical aspects of theimmunosuppressive milieu in myeloma and avenues where cellular therapies are now revolutionizing myeloma treatment. Areas covered: A particular focus is outcomes of clinical trials in myeloma published in PubMed database or abstract form usingvaccines or adoptive cell transfer: marrow infiltrating lymphocytes, T cellreceptor and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Expert Commentary: Immunotherapy has extraordinary potential in myeloma. Combinations of cellular therapies withimmunomodulatory molecules or checkpoint inhibitors are likely to be synergistic and now underway. Future directions include neoantigen or nanoparticle vaccinesand further modifications of engineered T cells such as use of dual-antigens,suicide genes or allogeneic cells.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma soluble cluster of differentiation 147 levels are increased in breast cancer patients and associated with lymph node metastasis and chemoresistance.,/pubmed/29807951,"INTRODUCTION: Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) contributes to breast cancerinvasion, metastasis, and multidrug resistance. Recent studies have shown thatperipheral soluble CD147 (sCD147) is increased in hepatocellular tumour andmultiple myeloma patients and correlated with disease severity. The primary aimof our study was to assess the level, as well as the biological and clinicalsignificance of sCD147 in breast cancer.METHODS: We tested plasma sCD147 levels in 308 breast cancer patients byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between February 2014 and February 2017. Asubset of 165 cases of benign breast diseases was included as a control group at the same period. We analysed the clinical significance of plasma sCD147 withrelevance to clinicopathological factors of breast cancer patients.RESULTS: Plasma sCD147 levels were significantly higher in patients with primary breast cancer than those with benign breast diseases (P=0.001), in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (T3-T4 tumour) than those in early breast cancer(T1-T2 tumour; P=0.001), in patients with lymph node metastasis than in thosewithout (P<0.001), and in patients with high recurrence risk than those withmedium recurrence risk (P<0.001). Plasma sCD147 levels were also significantlyhigher in the chemotherapy-resistant group than in the chemotherapy-sensitivegroup (P=0.040). Plasma sCD147 was an independent predictor for lymph nodemetastasis in breast cancer patients (P=0.001).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that plasma sCD147 levels are elevated in breast cancer patients. Soluble CD147 is also associated with tumour size, lymph node metastasis, high recurrent risk, and chemoresistance. Ourfindings support that plasma sCD147 is an independent predictive factor for lymphnode metastasis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Greater Spending Associated with Improved Survival for Some Cancers in OCM-Defined Episodes.,/pubmed/29799330,"BACKGROUND: Previous research finds significant variation in spending andutilization across regions, with little evidence of differences in outcomes.While such findings have been interpreted as evidence that spending can bereduced without compromising patient outcomes, the link between spendingvariation and outcomes remains a critical question.OBJECTIVE: To use evidence from geographic variations in spending and anindividual-level survival analysis to test whether spending within oncology care episodes is associated with survival, where episodes are defined as in the Centerfor Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Oncology Care Model (OCM).METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, patient data from theSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare (SEER-Medicare) database for 2007-2013 were linked to hospital referral regions (HRRs) using ZIP codes.Patients in the SEER program are a part of selected population-based cancerregistries throughout the United States whose records are linked to Medicareenrollment and claims data (93% of elderly registry patients were successfullylinked to Medicare data). Episodes of cancer care were defined as in the OCM: 6months following a triggering chemotherapy claim. We analyzed episodes of carefor 5 tumor types: advanced breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic myeloidleukemia (CML). We removed the effects of differentials in Medicare paymentrates, which were mostly geographic. Regression analysis was then used tocalculate standardized spending levels for each HRR, that is, spending adjustedfor differences in patient and episode characteristics. To examine the effect of spending during OCM-defined episodes on individual-level survival, we used Coxregression with patient characteristics and standardized HRR spending per episodeas covariates. To address concerns that may arise from multiple comparisonsacross the 5 tumor types, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control thefalse discovery rate.RESULTS: Our analysis showed significant differences in standardized spendingacross HRRs. Compared with spending at the 20th percentile episode, spending atthe 80th percentile ranged from 25% higher ($57,392 vs. $45,995 for MM) to 47%higher ($36,920 vs. $24,127 for RCC), indicating practice style variation across regions. The hazard of dying for patients with NSCLC and MM statisticallysignificantly decreased by 7% (HR = 0.93, P = 0.006) and 13% (HR = 0.87, P =0.019), respectively, for a $10,000 increase in standardized spending (in 2013U.S. dollars). For the 3 other cancers, spending effects were not statisticallysignificant. After using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a 5% falsediscovery rate, the effects of increased spending on improved survival for NSCLC and MM remained statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: The association we found between spending and survival suggestscaution may be warranted for physicians, pharmacists, other health careprofessionals, and policymakers involved in efforts to reduce across-the-boardspending within OCM-defined episodes for at least 2 of the 5 cancers studied.DISCLOSURES: Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticalsto Precision Health Economics in support of research design, analysis, andtechnical writing services.

Real-world Outcomes of Multiple Myeloma: Retrospective Analysis of the Czech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies.,/pubmed/29793653,"INTRODUCTION: Real-world data on patient outcomes and treatment patterns inmultiple myeloma (MM) are limited.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present noninterventional, observational,retrospective analysis of prospectively collected Czech patient medical recorddata from the Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies estimated real-world outcomesin adults with a diagnosis of symptomatic MM made between May 2007 and JuneÊ2014.RESULTS: In total, 2446 patients had initiated first-line treatment. The medianoverall survival since the diagnosis (primary endpoint) was 50.3 months (95%confidence interval, 46.1-54.5 months) and decreased with each successivetreatment line. A similar trend was observed for progression-free survival andthe depth of response. In line with European guidelines and clinical practice,bortezomib-, thalidomide-, and lenalidomide-based regimens were most commonlyused across all treatment lines (42.3%, 28.9%, and 18.4%, respectively). In thefirst line, bortezomib and thalidomide were used most often, with lenalidomidethe most commonly used agent in the relapse setting (second to fourth lines).Exploratory analyses revealed that younger age (² 65 years), lower international staging system stage, and previous stem cell transplantation were associated withsignificant improvements in overall and progression-free survival, especially in the early treatment lines.CONCLUSION: The present study is the first analysis of Czech data from theRegistry of Monoclonal Gammopathies, and it provides important insights into the real-world management of MM for physicians and healthcare providers.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Optimizing therapy in bortezomib-exposed patients with multiple myeloma.,/pubmed/29788798,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple myeloma prognosis has improved significantly during thepast decade, with survival prolongation mainly due to the incorporation of novel agents.

Expert commentary: For patients who finally relapse afterbortezomib exposure treatment strategy should be individualized. For patientswith disease resistant to bortezomib, the combination oflenalidomide-dexamethasone with a monoclonal antibody seems to be the mostoptimal choice for second-line treatment. For third line, pomalidomide-basedregimens can be effective even in bortezomib refractory patients.

Epidemiology of Late Health Effects in Ukrainian Chornobyl Cleanup Workers.,/pubmed/29787442,"This article summarizes the results of 30 y of follow-up of cancer and noncancer effects in Ukrainian cleanup workers after the Chornobyl accident. The number of power plant employees and first responders with acute radiation syndrome underfollow-up by the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine decreased from179 in 1986-1991 to 105 in 2011-2015. Cancers and leukemia (19) andcardiovascular diseases (21) were the main causes of deaths among acute radiationsyndrome survivors (54) during the postaccident period. Increased radiation risksof leukemia in the Ukrainian cohort of 110,645 cleanup workers exposed to lowdoses are comparable to those among survivors of the atomic bomb explosions inJapan in 1945. Additionally, an excess of chronic lymphocytic leukemia wasdemonstrated in the cleanup workers cohort for 26 y after the exposure. Asignificant excess of multiple myeloma incidence [standardized incidence rate(SIR) 1.61 %, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.21], thyroid cancer (SIR 4.18, 95% CI 3.76-4.59), female breast cancer (SIR 1.57 CI 1.40-1.73), and all cancers combined (SIR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09) was registered. High prevalence wasdemonstrated for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and mental health changes. However, the reasons for the increases require further investigation. To monitor other possible late effects of radiation exposure in Chornobyl cleanup workers,analytical cohort and case-control studies need to include cardiovascularpathology, specifically types of potentially radiogenic cancers using a molecularepidemiology approach. Possible effects for further study include increased ratesof thyroid, breast, and lung cancers and multiple myeloma; reduction of radiationrisks of leukemia to population levels; and increased morbidity and mortality of cleanup workers from cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Latest developments in MUC1 immunotherapy.,/pubmed/29784646,"Currently, there is renewed interest in attempting to recruit the host immunesystem to eliminate cancers, and within this renewed activity, MUC1 continues to arouse interest. MUC1 has been considered a possible therapeutic target for thepast 30 years as it is up-regulated, aberrantly glycosylated and its polarizationis lost in many adenocarcinomas. Moreover, MUC1 is expressed by somehaematopoietic cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloma. Althoughmultiple clinical trials have been initiated and immune responses have beendocumented, effective clinical benefit worthy of approval for general applicationhas not as yet been achieved. However, this does not appear to have quelled theinterest in MUC1 as a therapeutic target, as shown by the increase in the number of MUC1-based clinical trials initiated in 2017 ( Figure 1). As with alltranslational studies, incorporating new relevant research findings intotherapeutic strategy is difficult. Decisions are made to commit to a specificstrategy based on the information and data available when the trial is initiated.However, the time required for preclinical studies and early trials can renderthe founding concept not always appropriate for proceeding to a larger definitivetrial. Here, we summarize the attempts made, to date, to bring MUC1 into theworld of cancer immunotherapy and discuss how research findings regarding MUC1structure and function together with expanded knowledge of its interactions with the tumour environment and immune effector cells could lead to improvedtherapeutic approaches.ppbiost;46/3/659/BST20170400CF1F1BST-2017-0400CF1FigureÊ1.Number of MUC1-targetedtrials initiated each year.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies.,/pubmed/29775689,"In the past few years we have seen remarkable paradigm shifts in the treatment ofmany solid tumors due to the introduction of inhibitors targeting immunecheckpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Recent results indicate thatcheckpoint inhibition also represents a very promising approach for certain typesof hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is also associated with substantial toxicities and high costs and only a subsetof patients appears to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. Thisdemonstrates the urgent need for biomarkers for the identification of patientpopulations that are likely to respond to this type of therapy and/or have fewer side effects. Here, we have reviewed available information on the prognostic and predictive value of biomarkers for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 as the mostcommonly used checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently no reliable biomarkerscapable of predicting responses to anti-CTLA-4 agents, such as ipilimumab, inhematologic malignancies. Certain polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene, however, seemto have an impact on the patients' outcome, especially in the case of chroniclymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There is now sufficient data supporting PD-L1expression levels in the tumor tissue as an independent prognostic factor in Bcell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Overexpression ofPD-L1 in the tumor tissue and elevated serum levels of soluble PD-L1 may alsorepresent adverse prognostic factors in certain subtypes of T cell lymphomas.Finally, expression levels of PD-L1 also seem to predict responses toanti-PD-1/PD-L1 approaches in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Future studies willhave to further delineate the prognostic/predictive role of PD-L1 expression as abiomarker in hematologic malignancies and may be able to identify confoundingvariables, which will hopefully to some extent be generalizable to other types ofanti-tumor immunotherapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Seleno-l-methionine and l-ascorbic acid differentiate the biological activity of doxorubicin and its metal complexes as a new anticancer drugs candidate.,/pubmed/29773172,"The most important problems of anti-cancer therapy include the toxicity of thedrugs applied to healthy cells and the multi-drug cells resistance tochemotherapeutics. One of the most commonly used anticancer drugs is doxorubicin (DOX) used to treat certain leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, as well asbladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovarian, thyroid, multiple myeloma and othercancers. Preliminary studies showed that metal complex with DOX improve itscytostatic activity with changes in their molecular structure and distribution ofelectrons, resulting in a substantial change of its biological activity(including antitumor activity). Thus, there is a chance to receiving derivatives of DOX with low toxicity for the healthy body cells, thus increasing itstherapeutic selectivity. In the present study we examined the influence of Mn,Mg, Fe, Co and Ni, seleno-l-methionine and vitamin C on biological activity ofDOX in prokaryotic model - Escherichia coli RFM443, with plasmid transcriptional fusion of recA promoter and luxCDABE as a reporter gene. Cytotoxic potency oftested chemicals was calculated on the basis of the bacteria culture growthinhibition (GI%) values. Genotoxic properties were calculated on the basis of thefold increase (FI) of relative luminescence units (RLU) values compared tocontrol. Obtained results showed that doxorubicin metal complexes particularlywith Ni, Co and Fe increased the cyto- and genotoxic activities of DOX. Bacteria culture supplemented with SeMet and vitamin C differentiate the DOX and its metalcomplexes toxicity. It seems, that DOX-Ni, DOX-Fe and DOX-Co complexes could bepotent cytostatic drug candidates. Moreover, we noticed different sensitivity of recA::luxCDABE for 3_h and 24_h cultures of bacteria strain.

Recognizing Alcohol and Drug Impairment in the Workplace in Florida.,/pubmed/29939551,"Alcohol and drug abuse is a troubling and significant problem of healthcareprofessionals. Without identification and appropriate treatment, impairment oftenprogresses and compromises the workplace and patient safety. The danger issignificantly worse when the impaired health professional is responsible fortreating critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, emergencydepartment, or operating room. Medical professionals must be able to recognizesigns of this danger and protect against it Ñ both for the sake of patients andthe healthcare providers themselves. Health professional impairment is,unfortunately, a common problem in healthcare. Impairment results when a healthprofessional, such as a physician, nurse, or allied health professional, isunable to provide competent and safe patient care because they are impaired byalcohol, prescription or nonprescription drugs, or mind-altering substances.ÊImpairment may also result fromÊa psychological or neurologic condition thataffects the health professional's judgment.ÊAs a result of this impairment, thehealth professional is unable to safely perform professional duties andresponsibilities in the manner essential to their profession.Ê All healthprofessionals need to understand and be aware of the safety issues that becomeapparent when a health professional is impaired as the care provided extends toother health professionals as well as the institution. Ultimately, it isimportant that all health providers are aware of the signs and symptoms ofimpairment and the state and institution requirements of reportingindividualsÊsuspected working while in an impaired state. Impaired healthprofessionals often develop coping mechanisms that allow them to initially cover up their diminished capability to provide safe patient care. Eventually, theycommit obvious mistakes, medication errors, or procedural errors that becomereadily apparent. But, initially these violations may be subtle and only anastute and observant fellow practitioner will notice a change in behavior or the signs and symptoms of impairment. Often, to obtain mind-altering substances,impaired health professionals will divert controlled substances, such asnarcotics and benzodiazepines, from a patient to themselves. This can result in apatient being under medicated and induce unnecessary suffering. Use ofmind-altering substances over timeÊalsoÊmay result in the deterioration of thehealth professional's personal health. Use of narcotics, for example, may result in cardiovascular problems such as angina, hypertension, and myocardialinfarction; liver diseases such as cirrhosis, and hepatitis; infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency, hepatitis, and other blood-borne diseases; mentaldiseases such as depression, suicide, and anxiety; and traumatic injuries such asfalls, fractures, and head injuries.Ê Florida State and Federal Rules andRegulations Virtually all states include rules and regulations regarding the use of alcohol and drugs as the basis for disciplinary actions. Diversion of drugsfrom patients is dealt withÊparticularlyÊharshly. Almost all states also require reporting of health practitioners whoÊare suspected of impairment. These rulesand penalties vary from state to state. The Florida Nurse Nurse Practice Act[leg.state.fl.us, 2018] is provided as an example of typical state law in regardsto the use of controlled substances and the necessary reporting. Eachpractitioner should consult the rules and regulations for their own profession.464.018Ê Disciplinary Actions (h)Ê Unprofessional conduct, which shall include,but not be limited to, any departure from, or the failure to conform to, theminimal standards of acceptable and prevailing nursing practice, in which caseactual injury need not be established [leg.state.fl.us, 2018]. Most statesrequire the reporting of unprofessional conduct, whether it be by a physician,nurse, or allied health profession.Ê (i)Ê Engaging or attempting to engage in thepossession, sale, or distribution of controlled substances asÊset forth inchapter 893, for any other than legitimate purposes authorized by this chapter[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]. All states and the federal government takes a dim viewof health care practitioners who engage in the unlawful sale of prescription ornonprescription controlled substances. Penalties for violation can include fines and jail sentences. (j)Ê Being unable to practice nursing with reasonable skilland safety to patients by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or chemicals or any other type of material or as a result of any mental orphysical condition. In enforcing this paragraph, the department shall have, upon a finding of the secretary or the secretary's designee that probable cause existsto believe that the licensee is unable to practice nursing because of the reasonsstated in this paragraph, the authority to issue an order to compel a licensee tosubmit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by thedepartment. If the licensee refuses to comply with such order, the department'sorder directing such examination may be enforced by filing a petition forenforcement in the circuit court where the licensee resides or does business. Thelicensee against whom the petition is filed shall not be named or identified byinitials in any public court records or documents, and the proceedings shall beclosed to the public. The department shall be entitled to the summary procedureprovided in s. 51.011. A nurse affected by the provisions of this paragraph shallat reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that she or he can resume the competent practice of nursing with reasonable skill and safety to patients [leg.state.fl.us, 2018]. All states have varying rules in regards to theevaluation and prosecution of a health care practitioner that due to mentalillness or illicit use of controlled substances places a patients safety at risk.Health professionals have been prosecuted for felonies for harming patients dueto unprofessional and dangerous conduct. (k)Ê Failing to report to the departmentany person who the licensee knows is in violation of this chapter or of the rulesof the department or the board; however, if the licensee verifies that suchperson is actively participating in a board-approved program for the treatment ofa physical or mental condition, the licensee is required to report such persononly to an impaired professionals consultant. Most states require healthprofessionals who they believe are impaired to report to the appropriateauthority. Failure to report may have negative consequences for the healthpractitioner that is aware of the impairment and yet fails to report to theappropriate authority. (l)Ê Knowingly violating any provision of this chapter, a rule of the board or the department, or a lawful order of the board or departmentpreviously entered in a disciplinary proceeding or failing to comply with alawfully issued subpoena of the department. If the health professional knowingly violates the provisions, the consequence in most states is even more severe. All health professionals are obligated to be aware of the practice act rules andregulations in each of the states they hold a license. (m)Ê Failing to report to the department any licensee under chapter 458 or under chapter 459 who the nurse knows has violated the grounds for disciplinary action set out in the law underwhich that person is licensed and who provides health care services in a facilitylicensed under chapter 395, or a health maintenance organization certificatedunder part I of chapter 641, in which the nurse also provides services[leg.state.fl.us, 2018]. Most states have the right to specifically penalize ahealth professional who fails to report a health professional they know violatestate laws. Besides the legal concerns, health professionals have an ethical and moral duty to patients to report a health professional with a diminished capacityto perform their duties. (4)Ê The board shall not reinstate the license of anurse who has been found guilty by the board on three separate occasions ofviolations of this chapter relating to the use of drugs or narcotics, whichoffenses involved the diversion of drugs or narcotics from patients to personaluse or sale [leg.state.fl.us, 2018]. In many states, the ongoing abuse of drugsor alcohol can result in the permanent loss of a medical license. It is crucialthat all health professionals review the health practice act in each state where they hold a license, and that they comply with the reporting requirements. If oneis unsure of the requirements, most institutions will provide an attorney orother professional to assist with understanding the reporting process. Moststates have statutes designed to help healthcare practitioners identify and treatimpaired health care providers. Virtually all state medical boards require that ahealthcare provider suffering from alcohol or drug addiction self-report, andindividuals aware of the problem must report their peers.ÊDue to the fear ofreprisal, most states have a mechanism whereby a provider can confidentiallyreport a peer directly to an agency that can investigate and deal with theproblem.ÊProviding there has been no safety issues that directly affected apatient's care, the impaired practitioner can engage in treatment andrehabilitation and avoid board disciplinary action.Ê If a health profession isalready under discipline, has been terminated from rehabilitation, has solddrugs, or is at continuous risk to the public, the practitioner is less likely tobe given the opportunity to seek private treatment without publicconsequences.ÊHowever, if there is no danger to the patients, even The JointCommission supports treatment rather than punishment. To a certain extent,federal laws protect addicted health professionals. The Americans withDisabilities Act provides protection for addicted healthcare providers intreatment and recovery programs. It requires aÊ ""reasonable accommodation"" for anindividual who recognizes their alcohol or drug addiction and participates in arehabilitation program. Federal law does notÊconsider a person to be disabledbecause they are using drugs. In addition, the Family Medical Leave Act requires employers to allow time off for qualifiedÊsubstance abuseÊtreatment. Courts andstatutes usually protect health care providers' and medical boards' efforts toaddress substance abuse issues, particularly if practitioners have successfullycompleted treatment. However, if a practitioner harms a patient while under theinfluence of drugs or alcohol or an institution knowingly fails to protect apatient, the consequences can be severe. Examples include the following: A court granted immunity to the director of an impaired practitioner program whosuggested that healthcare professionals privileges be suspended until theycompleted substance abuse evaluation and treatment. During a medical malpractice case, a healthcare professional refused to turn over substance abuse treatmentrecords; the court ruled those records were privileged and confidential. A court dismissed a hospital from a malpractice suit that claimed negligent credentialingdue to a health professional prior alcohol and drug abuse. The court found theprofessional had completed successful treatment and had complied with amonitoring program for years, and the hospital acted reasonably in grantingprivileges. AÊÊpatient sued the hospital for improper credentialing because thehealth practitioner had committed malpractice in the past and was known by thehospital to be addicted to sedatives. The hospital was accessed punitive damages for negligent credentialing. A health professional admitted to being under theinfluence of an opiate during a surgical operation and a large punitive verdictwas awarded. DefinitionsAddiction:ÊA substantial loss of self-control indicatedby compulsive alcohol or drug use despite the desire to stop. It may involvecycles of relapse and remission, and if untreated, may result in disability orpremature death Drug diversion: The transfer of a controlled substance, such as adrug, from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution and use. Substance usedisorder: A disease of the brain which is characterized by the recurrent useofÊalcohol or drugs that result in functional impairment such as disability,health problems, and failure to meet responsibilities at home, work, or inschool. Impairment: The inability or impending inability to provide safe,professional activities and duties due to a behavioral, mental, or physicaldisorder related to alcohol or drugs.

Assessment of Peritoneal Membrane Arteriolar Structure in Conjunction with Traditional Cardiovascular System Evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 Patients.,/pubmed/29940595,"ACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiovascular complications are responsible for increasedmortality and morbidity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Functional and structural changes of peritoneal membrane are reported in CKD patients both onconservative treatment and on renal replacement therapy (RRT). The aim of thestudy was to assess the structure of peritoneal membrane small arteries(precapillary arterioles) in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD stage 5 patientsbefore initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and evaluate its relationship with heart and large arteries abnormalities and with selected biochemical parameters.METHODS: Evaluation of 42 CKD stage 5 patients before starting PD. Diabetic(n=26) and non-diabetic (n=16) patients were compared. Peritoneal membranesamples were taken during Tenckhoff catheter insertion. Histopathologicalevaluation of peritoneal precapillary arterioles (arteriolar evaluation) withmeasurement of wall thickness (WT) and calculation of lumen/vessel (L/V) ratiowas performed in each patients. Echocardiography, intima media thickness (IMT),pulse wave velocity (PWV), ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) andbiochemical parameters assessment: serum albumin (SA), total cholesterol (TCH),hemoglobin (Hgb), parathormone (PTH), serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (P),transferrin saturation (TSAT%), C-reactive protein (CRP) were performed in eachparticipant.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in peritonealmembrane arteriolar indices - wall thickness (WT) and L/V ratio betweeninvestigated groups. There was statistically significant higher PWV value indiabetic patients. There were no statistically significant differences inechocardiographic indices, IMT, laboratory data in analyzed groups. There weresome linear correlations between: PWV vs IMT (R=0,84; p=0,0006); PWV vs PP(R=0,58; p=0,03) in non-diabetic and linear correlation between: PWV vs age(R=0,75; p=0,02); WT vs DP (R=-0,93; p=0,001); WT vs DBP ( R=0,64; p=0,04) indiabetic group.CONCLUSION: Peritoneal membrane arteriolar damage seems to be an integrated part of cardiovascular system damage in CKD stage 5 patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring on Patient's Awareness and Goal Attainment Under Antihypertensive Therapy: The Factors Influencing Results in Anti-HypertenSive Treatment (FIRST) Study.,/pubmed/29940594,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite availability of a broad spectrum of blood pressure(BP)-lowering drugs many hypertensive patients do not attain BP goals. We aimedto evaluate the influence of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on patient'sawareness and attainment of BP goals under antihypertensive treatment withirbesartan alone or in combination with hydro-chlorothiazide.METHODS: In total, 1,268 patients with arterial hypertension were enrolled in theFactors Influencing Results in anti-hypertenSive Treatment (FIRST) study by 348general practitioners and internal medicine specialists across Switzerland.Patients selected for HBPM received detailed information and training on BPself-management. The study endpoints included patient's awareness and attainment of BP goals, and the efficacy and tolerability of antihypertensive treatment at 3months.RESULTS: Overall, the mean age was 61±13 years and 616 (49%) were women. The meansystolic/diastolic BP was 161±17/96±11 mmHg, and 239 (19%) patients had diabetes mellitus. 758 (60%) patients were instructed to use HBPM.

Multiple Primary Malignancies in Renal Transplant Recipients: a Single Centre Retrospective Cohort Study.,/pubmed/29940589,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Renal transplant recipients are exposed to immunosuppressivetreatment which may increase the risk for developing malignancies. Limited dataexists concerning the occurrence of multiple primary malignancies (MPM) in renal transplant patients.METHODS: All the patients who received a renal allograft at our institution from 1973 to 2017 were included in this investigation. Data from patients with moreMPM were obtained from the charts and medical records. Malignancies werecategorized as synchronous if the interval between occurrences was less than orequal to 6 months and metachronous if the interval was more than 6 months.RESULTS: Out of the 1884 patients who received a renal allograft, 164 (8.7%)developed a malignant tumor. Twenty-two patients (13.4%; 6 females, 16 males)developed MPM, 7 synchronous (31.8%) and 15 metachronous types (68.2%). The most common initial primary tumors were skin cancers (8) and kidney cancers (3).Furthermore, skin cancers were the most common second primary malignancies (9).Log-rank analysis revealed significantly better survival in the synchronous group(113.3 months) than in the metachronous group (24.6 months) (p=0.04).CONCLUSION: MPM are more frequent in renal transplant recipients than in thegeneral population.

Analysis of Genes Involved in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: Comparisons of 'Trigger' and 'Substrate' Differences.,/pubmed/29940585,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent research has improved our understanding of the pulmonary vein and surrounding left atrial (LA-PV) junction and the left atrial appendage(LAA), which are considered the 'trigger' and 'substrate' in the development ofatrial fibrillation (AF), respectively. Herein, with the aim of identifying theunderlying potential genetic mechanisms, we compared differences in geneexpression between LA-PV junction and LAA specimens via bioinformatic analysis.METHODS: Microarray data of AF (GSE41177) were downloaded from the GeneExpression Omnibus database. In addition, linear models for microarray data limmapowers differential expression analyses and weighted correlation network analysis(WGCNA) were applied.RESULTS: From the differential expression analyses, 152 differentially expressed genes and hub genes, including LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP, wereidentified. Our analysis revealed that the maps of extracellular matrix(ECM)-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathways, and ventricularcardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis were significantly enriched. In addition, theWGCNA results showed high correlations between genes and related genetic clustersto external clinical characteristics. Maps of the ECM-receptor interactions,chemokine signaling pathways, and the cell cycle were significantly enriched inthe genes of corresponding modules and closely associated with AF duration, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular ejection function, respectively. Similarly,mapping of the TNF signaling pathway indicated significant association withgenetic traits of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: The ECM-receptor interaction as a possible central node ofcomparison between LA-PV and LAA samples reflected the special functional rolesof 'triggers' and 'substrates' and may be closely associated with AF duration.Furthermore, LEP, FOS, EDN1, NMU, CALB2, TAC1, and PPBP genes may be implicatedin the occurrence and maintenance of AF through their interactions with eachother.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Thrombomodulin and Endothelial Dysfunction: A Disease-Modifier Shared between Malignant Hypertension and Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome.,/pubmed/29940557,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is an endothelial glycoprotein that is present in all bloodvessels. Five percent of all patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome(aHUS) have mutations in the gene coding for TM, with a peak presentation inyoung children. Mutations often translate into quantitative and qualitativeabnormalities of this endothelial glycoprotein. Outcome of the TM-associated aHUSis relatively poor with frequent relapses after transplantation despite itsmembrane-bound character. We observed a woman presenting with malignanthypertension (MHT) and associated kidney, brain, cardiac, and hematologicalinvolvement with thrombotic microangiopathy on kidney biopsy. She had adocumented mutation of the gene coding for TM, which was associated with bothaHUS and an increased risk for venous and arterial thrombosis. As TM hasanti-coagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties and alsoattenuates alternative complement activation, this glycoprotein could play anactive role in other diseases with endothelial involvement apart from aHUS. Wediscuss the potential role of TM in the pathophysiology of variousendotheliopathies including MHT. We also provide a framework for futuretherapeutic options.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MicroRNA-216a promotes M1 macrophages polarization and atherosclerosis progression by activating telomerase via the Smad3/NF-ë¼B pathway.,/pubmed/29940270,"Macrophages exhibit heterogeneity and plasticity and imbalance betweenpro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages plays a critical role inatherosclerosis progression. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) inmacrophages can be activated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-_B), but theregulation of telomerase activation on macrophages polarization remains unknown. We previously identified microRNA-216a (miR-216a) to promote inflammation throughdirectly targeting the Smad3/NF-_B pathway. The present study aimed to assesswhether miR-216a can regulate telomerase activity and promote macrophagespolarization during atherosclerosis progression. The results verified that TERTwas highly expressed in macrophages of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques.miR-216a was found to promote telomerase activation in macrophages by 4.5-fold(P_=_0.002) through the Smad3/NF-_B pathway. miR-216a also induced macrophagessenescence characterized by senescence-associated-_-galactosidase activity andp53 and p16 expression. TERT overexpression promoted the transformation of M2 to M1 while this conversion was suppressed once TERT was inhibited, and the related inflammatory factors and lipid uptake ability of M1 cells were also increased by TERT. In the carotid atherosclerotic plaques from miR-216a-treated apolipoproteinE-/- mice, the numbers of M1 macrophages were increased whereas M2 cells reduced,accompanying with inhibited Smad3 expression and upregulated inflammatory markersand TERT activity. Furthermore, plasma miR-216a level was specifically higher in patients with vulnerable mixed plaques (n_=_181) than those with calcifiedplaques (n_=_73) and controls (n_=_264). In summary, our findings first revealed a new molecular mechanism of macrophage polarization involving telomeraseactivation induced by miR-216a through the Smad3/NF-_B signaling, which mightserve as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis progression.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Lifestyle and progression of lower urinary tract symptoms in German men-results from the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort.,/pubmed/29940234,"OBJECTIVES: To examine if lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) progression wasrelated to anthropometric and lifestyle factors.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The analysis included 5,495 men who participated in theEPIC-Heidelberg cohort (recruited 1994-1998) and who reported an InternationalProstate Symptom Score (IPSS) < 8 at follow-up 4 (FUP4, 2007-2009), had notreported taking _-adrenoreceptor antagonists or 5-_ reductase inhibitors orprostate surgery for BPH/LUTS treatment. LUTS progression was defined as an IPSS ³ 8 at FUP5 (2010-2012). Using logistic regression analysis, education, maritalstatus, satisfaction with life, satisfaction with health, history of diabetes andof hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), waistcircumference, and physical activity were examined as potential LUTS risk factorsadjusting for age.RESULTS: Increase in BMI between baseline and FUP4 of ³ 2 BMI units was relatedto LUTS progression (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.08-1.57) compared with stable BMI. Compared to men who were very satisfied withlife at baseline, those who were satisfied (1.28, 1.11-1.47), unsatisfied (1.80, 1.31-2.46) or very unsatisfied with life (1.43, 0.62-3.34) were more likely toreport LUTS progression. Men with longer education had higher odds of LUTSprogression than men with primary education only (1.25, 1.06-1.48). Adjusting forBMI or lifestyle factors did not attenuate these associations. Smoking habits,alcohol consumption, physical activity, self-reported history of diabetes orhypertension, and marital status were not related with LUTS progression.CONCLUSION: Our results confirm some, but not all previously observed riskfactors for LUTS progression.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Do we need biomarkers for diabetics progressing to heart failure?,/pubmed/29940223,"There is a cardiovascular unfavorable duet consisting of arterial hypertensionand diabetes that is related with increased risk of heart failure.

Clinical Features of Central Serous Chorioretinopathy with Type 1 Choroidal Neovascularization.,/pubmed/29940168,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the type 1 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) incidence and associated factors in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) DESIGN:Retrospective case series METHODS: Records of 363 eyes (324 patients) with CSCwere reviewed. Age, sex, CSC type, choroidal vascular hyperpermeability (CVH),best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), andsystemic hypertension (HT) were assessed and compared between subjects with andwithout neovascular CSC.RESULTS: We identified 219 and 144 eyes with chronic and acute CSC, respectively.The mean participant age was 55.2 ± 12.0 years, and 58 (15.6%) eyes hadneovascular CSC. Age (no CNV: 54.8 ± 12.1 years, CNV: 57.3 ± 10.9 years; P =.118) and SCT (no CNV: 388.0 ± 104.5 _m, CNV: 377.4 ± 108.9 _m; P = .487) werecomparable between eyes with and without CNV. However, BCVA (logarithm of theminimum angle of resolution) was significantly worse in subjects with CNV (0.28 ±0.33 [20/38] vs. 0.15 ± 0.29 [20/28]; P = .014).

"Clinical and hemodynamic correlates of pulmonary arterial stiffness in incident, untreated patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.",/pubmed/29940163,"INTRODUCTION: The role of decreased pulmonary arterial (PA) compliance (C),equivalent to increased PA stiffness (1/C) as a critical determinant of rightventricular dysfunction and prognosis has been emphasized in pulmonary arterialhypertension (PAH).METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all incident patients diagnosed withidiopathic PAH by right heart catheterization who were enrolled in the French PAHNetwork registry between 2006-2016 and who had complete baseline data allowingcalculation of stiffness (PA pulse pressure/stroke volume index).RESULTS: In the 719 patients included (median age 66 years, 53.7% female), PAstiffness was 1.49 mmHg_m2/mL [IQR 1.08-2.04 mmHg_m2/mL]. Stiffness was relatedto mean PA pressure mPAP (r2=0.33) and heart rate (r2=0.15), but not to age orgender. Higher PA stiffness and higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) weredocumented in high-risk vs. low-risk patients, as defined by the ESC/ERSguidelines. The dispersion of the PVR_C product (RC-time) was as variable aspatient age and mPAP, and C could not be estimated on the basis of PVR alone (95%limits of agreement of the bias: -50% +54%). Transplant-free survival differedacross PA stiffness quartiles (p=0.04) but stiffness was not an independentpredictor of long-term outcome (median follow-up duration 2.43 years).CONCLUSIONS: In incident idiopathic PAH, PA stiffness was related to mPAP andheart rate, and this outperformed the potential influences of age and gender.Baseline PA stiffness did not independently predict outcome. The great dispersionof RC-time implied that PVR and PA stiffness were differently affected by thedisease process.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Individual and Joint Effects of Pulse Pressure and Blood Pressure Treatment Intensity on Serious Adverse Events in the SPRINT Trial.,/pubmed/29940151,"OBJECTIVE: To determine individual and joint effects of pulse pressure and blood pressure treatment intensity on serious adverse events in the Systolic BloodPressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).METHODS: Pulse pressure_=_systolic - diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressuretreatment intensity in the control arm was ² 140 mmHg and in the intensive armwas ² 120 mmHg. The primary outcome was a 5-point composite of hypotension,syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, acute renal insufficiency, or injuriousfalls.RESULTS: In 9,361 SPRINT participants, the incident rate for the primary outcome per 1000 person-years increased with higher pulse pressure category ² 49: 20.4(17.2-24.1), 50-59: 24.5 (21.3-28.2), 60-69: 31.7 (27.7-36.2), ³ 70: 44.6(39.8-49.9), Ptrend < 0.0001; hazard ratio (HR) of pulse pressure (every 10 mmHg)was 1.23, 95% CI: 1.18-1.28. Intensive treatment arm had a higher incidence rate of serious adverse events than control arm (34.2, 95% CI: 31.2-37.3 versus 26.0, 95% CI: 23.4-28.8, p=0.0001); HR of 1.32, 95% CI: 1.15-1.51. The combined effect was not significant in the relative risk scale (HR=0.97, pinteraction=0.48) butwas in the risk difference scale (p=0.027), contributing 2.5 additional seriousadverse events per 1000 person-years for every 10-mmHg increase in pulse pressurein excess of the individual effects of pulse pressure and treatment intensity.CONCLUSIONS: Wider pulse pressure and intensive blood pressure treatmentindividually were associated with the composite adverse event outcome. A modesteffect modification of pulse pressure and treatment intensity lead to additional adverse events when both were present. Clinicians should use caution in treating older patients with elevated pulse pressure to an intensive blood pressuretreatment target.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Childhood adiposity, adult adiposity, and the ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism: evidence of gene-environment interaction effects on adult blood pressure and hypertension status in adulthood.",/pubmed/29939946,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants may modify the associations of adiposity measureswith blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The insertion/deletion (I/D)polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is an attractivecandidate.AIMS: To examine interaction effects between I/D polymorphism and adipositymeasures (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and skinfold thickness)during childhood and adulthood in relation to adult BP and hypertension.METHODS: Data were available for 4835 participants from three prospective cohort studies. Multivariable linear regression models for adult SBP and DBP, andmultivariable logistic regression models for hypertension were fit that included interaction effects between child or adult adiposity and I/D polymorphism.RESULTS: Evidence for interaction effects on BP/hypertension were found acrossthe three studies. Compared with childhood measures, the effect modificationappeared to be more consistent when using adult adiposity. In particular, theadverse effects of greater adult waist circumference on increasing adult SBP and DBP appeared to be larger among carriers of ACE DD (or GG) [adjusted linearregression coefficients 0.26, 95% CI (0.21-0.31) and 0.28 (0.24-0.32) for SBP andDBP, respectively] and ID (or AG) genotypes [0.25 (0.21-0.29) and 0.25(0.21-0.28), respectively], whereas those with II (or AA) genotypes had smallereffects [0.15 (0.09-0.21) and 0.19 (0.13-0.23)].CONCLUSION: ACE genetic variation may modify the effect of adult adiposity onincreasing BP and risk of hypertension in adulthood. Individuals with ACE DD (or GG) and/or ID (or AG) genotypes, compared with those with II (or AA) genotype,appear more vulnerable to the impact of excess adiposity.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Why Effective Interventions Do Not Work for All Patients: Exploring Variation in Response to a Chronic Disease Management Intervention.,/pubmed/29939912,"BACKGROUND: Half of all Americans have a chronic disease. Promoting healthybehaviors to decrease this burden is a national priority. A number of behavioral interventions have proven efficacy; yet even the most effective of these has highlevels of nonresponse.OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explore variation in response to an evidence-based community health worker (CHW) intervention for chronic disease management.RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a convergent parallel design that combined a randomized controlled trial with a qualitative process evaluation that triangulated chartabstraction, in-depth interviews and participant observation.SUBJECTS: Eligible patients lived in a high-poverty region and were diagnosedwith 2 or more of the following chronic diseases: diabetes, obesity, hypertensionor tobacco dependence. There were 302 patients in the trial, 150 of whom wererandomly assigned to the CHW intervention. Twenty patients and their CHWs wereincluded in the qualitative evaluation.RESULTS: We found minimal differences between responders and nonresponders bysociodemographic or clinical characteristics. A qualitative process evaluationrevealed that health behavior change was challenging for all patients and mostexperienced failure (ie, gaining weight or relapsing with cigarettes) along theway. Responders seemed to increase their resolve after failed attempts at health behavior change, while nonresponders became discouraged and ""shut down.""CONCLUSIONS: Failure is a common and consequential aspect of health behaviorchange; a deeper understanding of failure should inform chronic diseaseinterventions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALY) for 15 Chronic Conditions and Combinations of Conditions Among US Adults Aged 65 and Older.,/pubmed/29939910,"BACKGROUND: Although the life expectancy for the US population has increased, ahigh proportion of this population has lived with ³1 chronic conditions. We have quantified the burden of disease associated with 15 chronic conditions andcombinations of conditions by estimating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for older US adults.RESEARCH DESIGN: Data were from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Cohort 15(baseline survey in 2012, follow-up survey 2014, with mortality follow-up throughJanuary 31, 2015). We included individuals aged 65 years and older (n=96,481). Weestimated mean QALY throughout the remainder of the lifetime according to theoccurrence of these conditions.RESULTS: The age-adjusted QALY was 5.8 years for men and 7.8 years for women.Over 90% respondents reported at least 1 condition and 72% reported multipleconditions. Respondents with depression and congestive heart failure had thelowest age-adjusted QALY (1.1-1.5_y for men and 1.5-2.2_y for women), whereasthose with hypertension, arthritis, and sciatica had higher QALY (4.2-5.4 and6.4-7.2_y, respectively). Having either depression or congestive heart failureand any 1 or 2 of the other 13 conditions was associated with the lowest QALYamong the possible dyads and triads of chronic conditions. Dyads and triads with hypertension or arthritis were more prevalent, but had higher QALY.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the burden of disease for common chronic conditionsand for combinations of these conditions is useful for delivering high-qualityprimary care that could be tailored for individuals with combinations of chronic conditions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mothers at Risk: Factors Affecting Maternal Postpartum Length of Stay.,/pubmed/29939881,"Perinatal complications linked to maternal comorbidities contribute to increased healthcare utilization through an extended postpartum length of stay (LOS).Understanding factors influencing postpartum LOS may minimize the adverse effectsassociated with comorbidities and complications. The purpose of this study was toidentify risk factors with the greatest odds of increasing postpartum LOS. Linked2008-2009 hospital discharge and birth certificate data were used to examinecomorbidities and complication codes in 1 015 424 births. The overall rate for anextended LOS (vaginal: >5 days/cesarean: >6 days) was 3.63 per 1000 live births. Complications were present in 17% of pregnancies; multiple complications wereseen in 1%. Chronic hypertension was associated with an extended stay for bothvaginal and cesarean births (odds ratio [OR] = 5.89 [95% CI, 4.39-7.88]; OR =3.57 [95% CI, 3.05-4.17], respectively). Puerperal infections (OR = 6.86 [95% CI,5.73-8.21]), eclampsia (OR = 17.07 [95% CI, 13.76-21.17]), and transfusions (OR =11.66 [95% CI, 9.20-14.75]) occurred most frequently and conferred the highestodds of an extended stay for vaginal births. Cerebrovascular conditions (OR =15.32 [95% CI, 11.90-19.60]) and infection (OR = 15.35 [95% CI, 10.11-23.32])conferred the highest odds of an extended LOS for cesarean births.

The Effect of Hypoxia on Cardiovascular Disease: Friend or Foe?,/pubmed/29939783,"Savla, Jainy J., Benjamin D. Levine, and Hesham A. Sadek. The effect of hypoxiaon cardiovascular disease: Friend or foe? High Alt Med Biol. 19:124-130,2018.-Over 140 million people reside at altitudes exceeding 2500_m across theworld, resulting in exposure to atmospheric (hypobaric) hypoxia. Whether thischronic exposure is beneficial or detrimental to the cardiovascular system,however, is uncertain. On one hand, multiple studies have suggested a protective effect of living at moderate and high altitudes for cardiovascular risk factorsand cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Conversely, residence at high altitudecomes at the tradeoff of developing diseases such as chronic mountain sicknessand high-altitude pulmonary hypertension and worsens outcomes for diseases suchas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interestingly, recently published data show a potential role for severe hypoxia as a unique and unexpected therapy aftermyocardial infarction. In this review, we will discuss the current literatureevaluating the effects of altitude exposure and the accompanying hypoxia onhealth and the potential therapeutic applications of hypoxia on CVD.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Antihypertensive drug reduction for treated hypertensive patients during the summer.,/pubmed/29939771,"Seasonal winter-summer variation in blood pressure (BP) has been reported, butthere are few reports on the reduction of antihypertensive medication during the summer. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and details of drug reductionduring the summer among outpatients. Among 667 patients, 90 patients (13.5%) had their medication reduced during the summer. The highest rate of drug reductionwas for diuretics (17.5%). The patients whose medications were reduced (Group R) took a larger number of drugs and more frequently took diuretics compared withthe subjects whose medications were unchanged (NÊ=Ê559; with no reduction orincrease in drugs, Group UC). Moreover, both the office BP and morning home BP ofthe patients in Group R were significantly lower compared with those of thepatients in Group UC. These results suggest that doctors tend to reduceantihypertensive drugs to avoid an excessive decrease in BP especially inpatients receiving combination therapy including diuretics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Differences in the treatment and control of hypertension in urban and rural residents of the northeastern region of the People's Republic of China: a cross-sectional study.,/pubmed/29939765,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a significant global public health problem and animportant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to determinetreatment and control rates of hypertension and to explore related risk factorsby urban and rural areas.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 14,956 participants (³Ê15Êyears) wasconducted in Jilin Province, China from July 2014 to December 2015 usingquestionnaire forms and physical measurements.RESULTS: Total rates of hypertension treatment, control, and controlled bloodpressure among treated subjects were 31.7%, 8.8%, and 27.9% in the JilinProvince. Rates of hypertension treatment, control, and controlled blood pressureamong treated subjects were 35.9%, 13.7%, and 38.3% in urban areas and 28.4%,5.0%, and 17.5% in rural areas, respectively. Higher treatment of hypertensionwas associated with older age, female sex, other races (except Han), and higherbody fat percentage in both areas. Among urban residents, higher education wasadditionally associated with higher treatment of hypertension; among ruralresidents, a family history of coronary artery disease and unemployment wereassociated with higher treatment of hypertension. Higher control of hypertension was associated with unemployment, married status, higher education, healthy body mass index, lower abdominal waist circumference, non-smoking status, and lowervisceral adiposity index in urban residents; higher control of hypertension wasassociated with younger age in rural residents.CONCLUSION: Treatment and control rates of hypertension in urban and rural areas were lower than the national average; blood pressure control in patients takingantihypertensive drugs needs further improvement.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A comparison of the cutaneous microvascular properties of the Spontaneously Hypertensive and the Wistar-Kyoto rats by Spectral analysis of Laser Doppler.,/pubmed/29939761,"This work was aimed to study skin blood perfusion, vasomotion and vascularresponses of the Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats(SHR) in different stages of age using spectral. Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF)was used to examine the ears and limbs of WKY (12 and 48 weeks old) and SHR (12and 48 weeks old). The skin blood flow oscillations (SBFOs) were studied bywavelet spectral analysis of LDF tracings. Then, we observed that old groupsshowed decreased perfusion and SBFO in the ears of both SHR and WKY. The SHRshowed obviously lower postocclusive reactive hypera (PORH) ratio at the sameage. A decreased peak-time occurred in the SHR of old age group. After PORH test,a statistically significant increase was observed within all subintervals in the absolute amplitude of 12-week WKY and only within IV and III subintervals in the absolute amplitude of 12-week SHR. But, the absolute amplitude of 48-week WKY andSHR showed no statistically significant increase within all subintervals.

Identification of Comprehensive Metabotypes Associated with Cardiometabolic Diseases in the Population-Based KORA Study.,/pubmed/29939495,"SCOPE: Metabotyping describes the grouping of metabolically similar individuals. We aimed to identify valid metabotypes in a large cohort for targeted dietaryintervention, e.g. for disease prevention.METHODS AND RESULTS: We grouped 1729 adults aged 32-77 years of the Germanpopulation-based KORA F4 study (2006-2008) using k-means cluster analysis basedon 34 biochemical and anthropometric parameters. We identified threemetabolically distinct clusters showing significantly different biochemicalparameter concentrations. Cardiometabolic disease status was determined atbaseline in the F4 study and at the 7-year follow-up termed FF4 (2013/2014) tocompare disease prevalence and incidence between clusters. Cluster 3 showed themost unfavorable marker profile with the highest prevalence of cardiometabolicdiseases. Also, disease incidence was higher in cluster 3 compared to clusters 2 and 1, respectively, for hypertension (41.2%/25.3%/18.2%), type 2 diabetes(28.3%/5.1%/2.0%), hyperuricemia/gout (10.8%/2.3%/0.7%), dyslipidemia(19.2%/18.3%/5.6%), all metabolic (54.5%/36.8%/19.7%) and all cardiovascular(6.3%/5.5%/2.3%) diseases together.CONCLUSION: Cluster analysis based on an extensive set of biochemical andanthropometric parameters allows the identification of comprehensive metabotypes that were distinctly different in cardiometabolic disease occurrence.

Activation of the ë_-common receptor by erythropoietin impairs acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in mouse mesenteric arterioles.,/pubmed/29939494,"Clinically, erythropoietin (EPO) is known to increase systemic vascularresistance and arterial blood pressure. However, EPO stimulates the production ofthe potent vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), in culture endothelial cells. Themechanism by which EPO causes vasoconstriction despite stimulating NO production may be dependent on its ability to activate two receptor complexes, thehomodimeric EPO (EPOR2 ) and the heterodimeric EPOR/_-common receptor (_CR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of each receptor to thevasoactive properties of EPO. First-order, mesenteric arteries were isolated from16-week-old male C57BL/6 mice, and arterial function was studied in pressurearteriographs. To determine the contribution of each receptor complex,EPO-stimulating peptide (ESP), which binds and activates the heterodimericEPOR/_CR complex, and EPO, which activates both receptors, were added to thearteriograph chamber 20Êmin prior to evaluation of endothelium-dependent(acetylcholine, bradykinin, A23187) and endothelium-independent (sodiumnitroprusside) vasodilator responses. Only ACh-induced vasodilation was impaired in arteries pretreated with EPO or ESP. EPO and ESP pretreatment abolishedACh-induced vasodilation by 100% and 60%, respectively. EPO and ESP did notaffect endothelium-independent vasodilation by SNP. Additionally, a novel _CRinhibitory peptide (_IP), which was computationally developed, prevented theimpairment of acetylcholine-induced vasodilation by EPO and ESP, furtherimplicating the EPOR/_CR complex. Last, pretreatment with either EPO or ESP didnot affect vasoconstriction by phenylephrine and KCl. Taken together, thesefindings suggest that acute activation of the heterodimeric EPOR/_CR inendothelial cells leads to a selective impairment of ACh-mediated vasodilatorresponse in mouse mesenteric resistance arteries.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Amiloride resolves resistant edema and hypertension in a patient with nephrotic syndrome; a case report.,/pubmed/29939487,"Sodium and fluid retention is a hallmark and a therapeutic challenge of thenephrotic syndrome (NS). Studies support the ""overfill"" theory of NS withpathophysiological proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)which explains the common observation of suppressed renin -angiotensin system andpoor therapeutic response to ACE inhibitors. Blockade of ENaC by the diureticamiloride would be a rational intervention compared to the traditionally usedloop diuretics. We describe a 38-year-old male patient with type1 diabetes whodeveloped severe hypertension (200/140ÊmmHg), progressive edema (of at least10ÊL), and overt proteinuria (18.5Êg/24Êh), despite combined administration offive antihypertensive drugs. Addition of amiloride (5Êmg/day) to treatmentresulted in resolution of edema, weight loss of 7Êkg, reduction in blood pressure(150/100-125/81ÊmmHg), increased 24Êh urinary sodium excretion(127-165Êmmol/day), decreased eGFR (41-29ÊmL/min), and increased plasma potassiumconcentration (4.6-7.8Êmmol/L). Blocking of ENaC mobilizes nephrotic edema andlowers blood pressure in NS. However, acute kidney injury and dangeroushyperkalemia is a potential risk if amiloride is added to multiple otherantihypertensive medications as ACEi and spironolactone. The findings supportthat ENaC is active in NS and is a relevant target in adult NS patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Distinct phenotype of kidney stone formers with renal phosphate leak.,/pubmed/29939320,"Background: Hypercalciuria is the most frequent metabolic disorder encountered inkidney stone formers (SF). Reduced renal phosphate reabsorption (i.e. renalphosphate leak) was proposed to be a driver of hypercalciuria in calcium SF.However, the phenotype of SF with renal phosphate leak remains poorly defined andthe association of renal phosphate leak with stone history, stone composition andbone mineral density (BMD) has not been studied.Methods: To fill these knowledge gaps, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis ina cohort of 555 idiopathic calcareous SF. The ratio of tubular maximumreabsorption of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was used toevaluate renal phosphate transport.Results: Multivariable regression analyses revealed a negative association ofparathyroid hormone (PTH), a positive association of 25-hydroxy vitamin D(25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) but no association offibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) with TmP/GFR. SF with low TmP/GFR had theirfirst stone event at a younger age and were more likely to have a positive familyhistory of kidney stones. In addition, urinary calcium excretion and prevalenceof brushite stones were significantly higher in SF with low TmP/GFR. However,BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, was not associated withTmP/GFR in SF.Conclusions: Renal phosphate handling has a strong heritable component in SF and correlates with PTH, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, but not with FGF23 levels.Furthermore, a low TmP/GFR (i.e. a renal phosphate leak) is associated withhigher urinary calcium excretion and an increased prevalence of brushite stones.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Design of a clinical risk calculator for major clinical outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease.,/pubmed/29939316,"Background: Risk stratification in atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD)can influence treatment decisions and facilitate patient selection forrevascularization. In this study, we aim to use variables with the bestpredictive value to design a risk calculator that can assist clinicians with riskstratification and outcome prediction.Methods: Patients with a radiological diagnosis of ARVD referred to our tertiary renal centre were recruited into this prospective cohort study between 1986 and2014. Primary clinical endpoints included: death, progression to end-stage kidneydisease and cardiovascular events (CVE). A stepwise regression model was used to select variables with the most significant hazard ratio for each clinicalendpoint. The risk calculator was designed using Hypertext Markup Language.Survival and CVE-free survival were estimated at 1, 5 and 10_years.Results: In total, 872 patients were recruited into the Salford ARVD study with amedian follow-up period of 54.9_months (interquartile range 20.2-96.0). Onlymodels predicting death and CVE showed good performance (C-index >0.80). Survivalprobabilities obtained from the risk calculator show that most patients with ARVDhave reduced long-term survival. Revascularization improved outcomes in patients with higher baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower proteinuriabut not in those with co-existing comorbidities and higher levels of baselineproteinuria.Conclusions: Although this risk calculator requires further independentvalidation in other ARVD cohorts, this study shows that a small number of easily obtained variables can help predict clinical outcomes and encourage apatient-specific therapeutic approach.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The impact of symptoms on health-related quality of life in elderly pre-dialysis patients: effect and importance in the EQUAL study.,/pubmed/29939304,"Background: Quality of life (QoL) is an important outcome in chronic kidneydisease (CKD). Patients feel that symptoms are an important determinant of QoL.However, this relation is unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate theimpact of the number and severity of symptoms on QoL in elderly pre-dialysispatients, assessed by both the effect of symptoms and their importance relativeto kidney function, and other clinical variables on QoL.Methods: The European Quality study (EQUAL study) is an ongoing Europeanprospective follow-up study in late Stage 4/5 CKD patients aged_³65_years. Weused patients included between March 2012 and December 2015. Patients scoredtheir symptoms with the Dialysis Symptom Index, and QoL with the research anddevelopment-36 (RAND-36) item Health Survey (RAND-36). The RAND-36 results in aphysical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). We usedlinear regression to estimate the relation between symptoms and QoL at baselineand after 6 months, and to calculate the variance in QoL explained by symptoms.Results: The baseline questionnaire was filled in by 1079 (73%) patients (median age 75 years, 66% male, 98% Caucasian), and the follow up questionnaire by 627(42%) patients. At baseline, every additional symptom changed MCS with -0.81 [95%confidence interval (CI): -0.91 to -0.71] and PCS with -0.50 (95% CI: -0.62 to-0.39). In univariable analyses, number of symptoms explained 22% of MCS varianceand 11% of PCS variance, whereas estimated glomerular filtration rate onlyexplained 1%.Conclusions: In elderly CKD Stage 4/5 patients, symptoms have a substantialimpact on QoL. This indicates symptoms should have a more prominent role inclinical decision-making.",N,,,,,,,,,,
CD1d-dependent natural killer T cells attenuate angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling via IL-10 signaling in mice.,/pubmed/29939225,"Aims: Cd1d is a member of the cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) family ofglycoproteins expressed on the surface of various antigen-presenting cells, whichis recognized by natural killer T (NKT) cells. CD1d-dependent NKT cells play animportant role in immune-mediated diseases; but the role of these cells inregulating cardiac remodeling remains unknown.Methods and Results: Cardiac remodeling was induced by angiotensin (Ang) IIinfusion for 2 weeks. Ang II-induced increase in hypertension, cardiacperformance, hypertrophy and fibrosis, inflammatory response and activation ofthe NF-kB and TGF-_1/Smad2/3 pathways was significantly aggravated in CD1dknockout (CD1dko) mice compared with wild type (WT) mice, but these effects were markedly abrogated in WT mice treated with _-galactosylceramide (_GC), a specificactivator of NKT cells. Adoptive transfer of CD1dko bone marrow cells to WT mice further confirmed the deleterious effect of CD1d knockout. Moreover, IL-10expression was significantly decreased in CD1dko hearts but increased in_GC-treated mice. Co-culture experiments revealed that CD1dko dentritic cells(DCs) significantly reduced IL-10 mRNA expression from NKT cells. Administration of recombinant murine IL-10 to CD1dko mice improved hypertension, cardiacperformance and adverse cardiac remodeling induced by Ang II, and itscardioprotective effect was possibly associated with activation of STAT3, andinhibition of the TGF-_1 and NF-kB pathways.Conclusion: These findings revealed a previously undefined role forCD1d-dependent NKT cells in Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling, hence activationof NKT cells may be a novel therapeutic target for hypertensive cardiac disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Depressive Symptoms and their Relation to Age and Chronic diseases among middle-aged and Older Adults in rural South Africa.,/pubmed/29939214,"Background: Understanding how depression is associated with chronic conditionsand socio-demographic characteristics can inform the design and effectivetargeting of depression screening and care interventions. In this study, wepresent some of the first evidence from sub-Saharan Africa on the associationbetween depressive symptoms and a range of chronic conditions (diabetes, HIV,hypertension, and obesity) as well as socio-demographic characteristics.Methods: A questionnaire was administered to a population-based simple randomsample of 5,059 adults aged 40 years in Agincourt, South Africa. Depressivesymptoms were measured using a modified version of the eight-item Center forEpidemiological Studies Depression screening tool. Diabetes was assessed using a capillary blood glucose measurement and HIV using a dried blood spot.Results: 17.0% (95% CI: 15.9% - 18.1%) of participants had at least threedepressive symptoms. None of the chronic conditions were significantly associatedwith depressive symptoms in multivariable regressions. Older age was thestrongest correlate of depressive symptoms with those aged 80 years and olderhaving on average 0.63 (95% CI: 0.40 - 0.86; p<0.001) more depressive symptomsthan those aged 40-49 years. Household wealth quintile and education were notsignificant correlates.Conclusions: This study provides some evidence that the positive associations of depression with diabetes, HIV, hypertension, and obesity that are commonlyreported in high-income settings might not exist in rural South Africa. Ourfinding that increasing age is strongly associated with depressive symptomssuggests that there is a particularly high need for depression screening andtreatment among the elderly in rural South Africa.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The TreadWheel: Interval Training Protocol for Gently Induced Exercise in Drosophila melanogaster.,/pubmed/29939171,"The incidence of complex metabolic diseases has increased as a result of awidespread transition towards lifestyles of increased caloric intake and lowered activity levels. These multifactorial diseases arise from a combination ofgenetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. One such complex disease isMetabolic Syndrome (MetS), which is a cluster of metabolic disorders, includinghypertension, hyperglycemia, and abdominal obesity. Exercise and dietaryintervention are the primary treatments recommended by doctors to mitigateobesity and its subsequent metabolic diseases. Exercise intervention, inparticular aerobic interval training, stimulates favorable changes in the common risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD),and other conditions. With the influx of evidence describing the therapeuticeffect exercise has on metabolic health, establishing a system that modelsexercise in a controlled setting provides a valuable tool for assessing theeffects of exercise in an experimental context. Drosophila melanogaster is agreat tool for investigating the physiological and molecular changes that result from exercise intervention. The flies have short lifespans and similar mechanismsof metabolizing nutrients when compared to humans. To induce exercise inDrosophila, we developed a machine called the TreadWheel, which utilizes thefly's innate, negative geotaxis tendency to gently induce climbing. This enables researchers to perform experiments on large cohorts of genetically diverse flies to better understand the genotype-by-environment interactions underlying theeffects of exercise on metabolic health.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sequential treatment with riociguat and balloon pulmonary angioplasty for patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.,/pubmed/29939102,"Riociguat is the treatment of choice for inoperable patients with chronicthromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We addressed here whetheradditional balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) provides further benefits. Aprospective series of 36 consecutive patients with inoperable CTEPH were treated with riociguat at least three months before BPA. All patients underwentdiagnostic workup at baseline, before BPA treatments, and six months after final intervention. The main outcome measures were pulmonary hemodynamic parameters andWorld Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC). Significant improvementsin pulmonary hemodynamics and physical capacity were observed for riociguattreatment, and subsequent BPA interventions yielded further benefits. Withtargeted medication, WHO FC improved by at least one class in 13 (36.1%) patients( P_=_0.01). Hemodynamic assessment showed significant improvements in meanpulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (49_±_12_mmHg vs. 43_±_12_mmHg; P_=_0.003) andPVR (956_±_501_dynásácm-5 vs. 517_±_279_dynásácm-5; P_=_0.0001). Treatment with acombination of targeted medication and BPA resulted in WHO FC improvement in 34(94.4%) patients.

Current aspects in sepsis approach. Turning things around.,/pubmed/29938972,"The incidence and prevalence of sepsis depend on the definitions and records thatwe use and we may be underestimating their impact. Up to 60% of the cases comefrom the community and in 30-60% we obtain microbiological information. Sometimesits presentation is ambiguous and there may be a delay in its detection,especially in the fragile population. Procalcitonin is the most validatedbiomarker for bacterial sepsis and the one that best discriminates thenon-infectious cause. Presepsin and pro-adrenomedullin are useful for earlydiagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis in septic patients. The combination of biomarkers is even more useful to clarify an infectious cause than anyisolated biomarker. Resuscitation with artificial colloids has worse results thancrystalloids, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The combination ofsaline solution and balanced crystalloids is associated with a better prognosis. Albumin is only recommended in patients who require a large volume of fluids. Themodern molecular methods on the direct sample or the identification by MALDI-TOF on positive blood culture have helped to shorten the response times in diagnosis,to optimize the antibiotic treatment and to facilitate stewardship programs. The hemodynamic response in neonates and children is different from that in adults.In neonatal sepsis, persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to an increase inright ventricular afterload and heart failure with hepatomegaly. Hypotension,poor cardiac output with elevated systemic vascular resistance (cold shock) isoften a terminal sign in septic shock. Developing ultra-fast Point-of-Care tests (less than 30 minutes), implementing technologies based on omics, big data ormassive sequencing or restoring ""healthy"" microbiomes in critical patients after treatment are the main focuses of research in sepsis. The main benefits ofestablishing a sepsis code are to decrease the time to achieve diagnosis andtreatment, improve organization, unify criteria, promote teamwork to achievecommon goals, increase participation, motivation and satisfaction among teammembers, and reduce costs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Genetic aspects of primary hyperaldosteronism.,/pubmed/29938936,"Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) is the most common form of secondaryhypertension of hormonal origin. It affects about 10% of all hypertensivepatients. It is connected with increased morbidity and mortality fromcardiovascular diseases (CVD) compared to patients with essential hypertension ofa similar age. Usually, it is an effect of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH) oraldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), more rare causes of PHA are: unilateraladrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, ectopicaldosterone-producing tumors and familial hyperaldosteronism. Recent geneticstudies have thrown a new light on the pathogenesis of PHA, classifying it as achannelopathy. Several mutations within the ion channels encoding genes have beenidentified. A possible link between primary hyperaldosteronism and polymorphismof aldosterone synthase gene and ion channel genes is still being investigated.In this manuscript, we focus on genetic aspects of primary hyperaldosteronism,and present an up-to-date compilation of available data with the widenedpathogenetic approach.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in adolescents and adults with congenital heart disease.,/pubmed/29938932,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD) may be at higher risk of acquired cardiovascular disease than the general population due to theirunderlying physiology and/or surgical sequelae. We sought to assess theprevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in youth and adults with CHD.METHODS: We assessed cardiovascular health as per the Cardiovascular Health inAmbulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) health index in patients with CHD aged15+ years who attended cardiology outpatient clinics. Participants self-reported smoking behavior, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and whetherthey had diabetes and hypertension. Individual health indices were categorizedinto ideal/not ideal, and sum of individual health indices was categorized aspoor, intermediate or ideal cardiovascular health as per CANHEART criteria.RESULTS: We included n_=_102 adults (35.4_±_12.9 years, 46% female) and n_=_88youth (17.2 ±1.1 years, 41% female). Most individuals reported to be nonsmokers(88% youth vs 86% adults) and to consume ³5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day (83% vs 85%, respectively). More adults than youth were overweight/obese (52%vs 22%, p_<_0.001) though more adults than youth reported meeting age-specificphysical activity guidelines (84% vs 55%, p_<_0.001). According to CANHEARThealth index criteria, 32% of youth and 27% of adults were in idealcardiovascular health.CONCLUSIONS: A low proportion of individuals with CHD are in ideal cardiovascularhealth, suggesting a need to promote healthy lifestyles during adolescence andthroughout adulthood in these individuals.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Nutrition and Nutraceuticals in Neuroinflammatory and Brain Metabolic Stress: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,/pubmed/29938622,"A steep rise in the incidences of neurodegenerative disorders could be thecombined effect of several non-genetic factors such as increased life expectancy,environmental pollutants, lifestyle, and dietary habits, as the population-level genetic change would require multiple generations. Emerging evidence demonstratesthat chronic over-nutrition induces brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation,and both are individually known to promote neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD).Although the association of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension,dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis with the dietary habits is well known, theunderstanding of neuronal implications of diet and nutritional supplements isstill in the infancy. Transcriptomics and proteomics-based studies support theview that nutraceuticals target multiple neuroprotective pathways in a slow butmore physiological manner without causing severe adverse effects, and mayrepresent the future of tackling neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, i)we review the diet/dietary supplement connection with the brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation and ii) summarize the current advancements on the effectsof nutraceuticals on the neurodegenerative disorders.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Beneficial Morphofunctional Changes Promoted by Sildenafil in Resistance Vessels in the Angiotensin II-Induced Hypertension Model.,/pubmed/29938618,"BACKGROUND: By acting on multiple targets and promoting diverse actions,angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a pivotal role in vascular function. Recent studiessuggested that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors exhibit therapeutic effectsin cardiovascular diseases. Here, the effects of sildenafil on vasculardisturbances were analyzed in a mouse model of Ang II-induced hypertension.METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6 mice were used as untreated animals (Control)or infused with Ang II (1000 _g/kg/min) for 28 days and treated with sildenafil(40 mg/kg/min) or vehicle (Ang II) during the last two weeks. After 4 weeks, the Ang II animals exhibited a high systolic blood pressure (186±3 mmHg vs. 127±3mmHg for Control mice), which was attenuated by sildenafil (163±7 mmHg). Themesenteric vessels from the Ang II animals revealed damage to the endotheliallayer, an increase in the cross-section area (1.9-fold) and vascular cellproduction of peroxynitrite (512±13 a.u.), which was ameliorated in the AngII-Sil group (1.2-fold and 400±17 a.u.). Analysis of the vascular responsiveness showed an increased contractility response to norepinephrine in Ang II animals(Rmax: 70%), which was abolished by sildenafil through increased nitric oxide(NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) andvasoconstrictor prostanoids.CONCLUSION: Sildenafil attenuates the morphofunctional deleterious effects of AngII on resistance vessels. The benefits of sildenafil seem to occur throughrestoring the balance of ROS/NO/eicosanoids. Therefore, this study opened newavenues for further clinical targeting of the treatment of cardiovasculardiseases related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Coronary microvascular and cardiac dysfunction due to homocysteine pathometabolism; a complex therapeutic design.,/pubmed/29938610,"In various metabolic diseases both the coronary circulation and cardiacmetabolism are altered. Here we summarize the effects of a condition calledhyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) - which can develop due to genetic or environmentalcauses - on the function of coronary microvessels and heart. This metabolicdisease is underappreciated, yet even mild or moderate elevation of plasmaconcentrations of homocystein (Hcy, plasma Hcy >16 _M), a sulfur-containing aminoacid produced via methionine metabolism) leads to coronary and peripheral artery and even venous vessel diseases, leading to vasomotor dysfunction and increasedthrombosis, consequently increased morbidity and mortality. Yet the underlyingmechanisms are not yet revealed. Recent studies indicated that there are commonpathomechanisms, which may affect all cellular function involved. Two mainmechanisms are the dysfunction of nitric oxide (NO) pathway resulting reduceddilator responses of arteries and arterioles with methionine diet-inducedhyperhomocysteinemia, and the simultaneously increased thromboxane A2 (TXA2)activity both in vessels and platelets. These changes are likely due to anincreased production of reactive oxidative species (oxidative stress) due toincreased NADPH oxidase assembly, which eventually lead to inflammatory process(indicated by increases in TNF_, NF_beta, p22phox, p67phox, and rac-1, levels)and changes in various gene expressions and morphological remodeling of vessels. Increased superoxide production and reduced ability of NO alters the regulationof mitochondrial function in the myocardium. The interactions of thesepathomechanisms may explain why HHcy increases the uptake of glucose and lactate and decreases the uptake of free fatty acid by the heart. The pathologicalconsequences of HHcy could be worsening by the simultaneous presence of otherrisk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.All in all, HHcy and associated pathometabolism lead to severe changes anddysfunctions of coronary arterial vessels and cardiac function, which may notalways apparent in clinical settings but most likely, contribute to increasedprevalence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, which however can be reducedby appropriate prevention and treatments. We believe that HHcy is anunderestimated - likely due to inappropriate clinical trials - but seriousdisease condition because it promotes the development of atherosclerosis in largearterial vessels, vasomotor dysfunction in microvessels, hypertension andthrombosis. In this review we will summarizes previous functional findingsfocusing on coronary vessels and cardiac function and the underlying cellular andmolecular mechanisms enabling the development of novel treatments.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Optimal Starting Age for Colorectal Cancer Screening in an Era of Increased Metabolic Unhealthiness: A Nationwide Korean Cross-Sectional Study.,/pubmed/29938455,"Background/Aim: The association between metabolic syndrome and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suggested as one of causes for the increasing incidence of CRC,particularly in younger age groups. The present study examined whether thecurrent age threshold (50 years) for CRC screening in Korea requires modificationwhen considering increased metabolic syndrome.Methods: We analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Corporationdatabase, which covers ~97% of the population in Korea. CRC risk was stratifiedaccording to age and the presence or absence of relevant metabolic syndromecomponents (diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension).Results: A total of 51,612,316 subjects enrolled during 2014 to 2015 wereanalyzed. Among them, 19.3% had diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or somecombination thereof. This population had a higher incidence of CRC than did thosewithout these conditions, and this was more prominent in subjects _40 years ofage. The optimal cutoff age for detecting CRC, based on the highest Youden index,was 45 years among individuals without diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although individuals with at least one of these components of metabolic syndrome had the highest Youden index at 62 years old, the value was only 0.2. Resettingthe cutoff age from 50 years to 45 years achieved a 6% increase in sensitivityfor CRC detection among the total population.Conclusions: Starting CRC screening earlier, namely, at 45 rather than at 50years of age, may improve secondary prevention of CRC in Korea.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
A Community Needs Assessment of Urban Utah American Indians and Alaska Natives.,/pubmed/29938368,"The needs of Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are oftennot well understood. In order to inform programs and services, the Urban IndianCenter of Salt Lake (UIC-SL), in cooperation with researchers from the Universityof Utah, undertook a community needs assessment of AI/AN living along Utah'sWasatch Front. A 60-item questionnaire was developed to capture information abouthealth status, services used, unmet needs, and common sources of informationabout AI/AN community events and activities. Study participants (n_=_336) were a convenience sample. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation,percentage, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. The most common healthprovider diagnosed medical conditions included hypertension, obesity, anddiabetes. The prevalence of violence, substance abuse, and mental healthconditions were also high among study participants and their families. Comparedto the general Utah population, study participants experienced disparitiesrelative to diabetes prevalence, cognitive and visual disabilities, and access tohealth care. In addition to health care services, respondents indicated a needfor cultural, social, and educational programs. They also reported high levels oftechnology use, suggesting a possible avenue for communicating with thispopulation. This community-based participatory research project provided richinformation about the unmet needs of this urban AI/AN population. The resultswill be used to guide UIC-SL strategic planning, and a database created for this project will be available for future data collection, allowing for comparison of results between sites and over time.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High-density lipoproteins (HDL) composition and function in preeclampsia.,/pubmed/29938347,"PURPOSE: To evaluate (a) the properties of high-density lipoproteins(HDL)/cholesterol, which include apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1) and paraoxonase1(PON1), both are negative predictors of cardiovascular risk and (b) HDL function,among women with preeclampsia (PE). PE is a multi-system disorder, characterized by onset of hypertension and proteinuria or other end-organ dysfunction in thesecond half of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk forlater cardiovascular disease. The inverse association between HDL, cholesterollevels and the risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease iswell-established.METHODS: Twenty-five pregnant women [19 with PE and 6 with normal pregnancy (NP)]were recruited during admission for delivery. HDL was isolated from bloodsamples. PON1 activity and HDL were analyzed. An in vitro model of endothelialcells was used to evaluate the effect of HDL on the transcription response ofvascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression.RESULTS: PON1 activity (units/ml serum) was lower in the PE group compared tonormal pregnancy (NP) (6.51_±_0.73 vs. 9.98_±_0.54; P_=_0.015). Increased ApoA1was released from PE-HDL as compared to NP-HDL (3.54_±_0.72 vs. 0.89_±_0.35;P_=_0.01). PE-HDL exhibited increased VCAM-1 mRNA expression and decreased eNOSmRNA expression on TNF-_ stimulated endothelial cells as compared to NP-HDL.CONCLUSIONS: HDL from women with PE reduced PON1 activity and increased ApoA1release from HDL particles. This process was associated with increased HDLdiameter, suggesting impaired HDL anti-oxidant activity. These changes mightcontribute to higher long-term cardiovascular risks among women with PE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sleep Apnea Is a Risk Factor for Stroke and Vascular Dementia.,/pubmed/29938308,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review the cerebrovascular complicationsof sleep apnea (SA).

SA increases the risk of hypertension, stroke, myocardialinfarction, and atrial fibrillation (AF) and is closely linked to vasculardementia. In addition, SA may worsen the neurologic outcome in acute strokepatients and interferes with rehabilitation after stroke. Proper management of SAmay decrease the clinical impact of stroke risk factors, improve neurologicoutcome after stroke, and lessen the progression of subcortical ischemic vasculardisease.

Pulmonary Artery Size in Interstitial Lung Disease and Pulmonary Hypertension: Association with Interstitial Lung Disease Severity and Diagnostic Utility.,/pubmed/29938208,"Purpose: It is postulated that ILD causes PA dilatation independent of thepresence of pulmonary hypertension (PH), so the use of PA size to screen for PHis not recommended. The aims of this study were to investigate the association ofPA size with the presence and severity of ILD and to assess the diagnosticaccuracy of PA size for detecting PH.Methods: Incident patients referred to a tertiary PH centre underwent baselinethoracic CT, MRI and right heart catheterisation (RHC). Pulmonary artery diameterwas measured on CT pulmonary angiography and pulmonary arterial areas on MRI. Athoracic radiologist scored the severity of ILD on CT from 0 to 4, 0 = absent, 1 = 1-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75%, and 4 = 76-100% extent of involvement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and linear regression were employed to assessdiagnostic accuracy and independent associations of PA size.Results: 110 had suspected PH due to ILD (age 65 years (SD 13), M:F 37:73) and379 had suspected PH without ILD (age 64 years (SD 13), M:F 161:218). CT derived main PA diameter was accurate for detection of PH in patients both with andwithout ILD - AUC 0.873, p =< 0.001, and AUC 0.835, p =< 0.001, respectively, as was MRI diastolic PA area, AUC 0.897, p =< 0.001, and AUC 0.857, p =< 0.001,respectively Significant correlations were identified between mean pulmonaryarterial pressure (mPAP) and PA diameter in ILD (r = 0.608, p < 0.001), andnon-ILD cohort (r = 0.426, p < 0.001). PA size was independently associated with mPAP (p < 0.001) and BSA (p = 0.001), but not with forced vital capacity %predicted (p = 0.597), Transfer factor of the lungs for carbon monoxide (TLCO) % predicted (p = 0.321) or the presence of ILD on CT (p = 0.905). The severity ofILD was not associated with pulmonary artery dilatation (r = 0.071, p = 0.459).Conclusions: Pulmonary arterial pressure elevation leads to pulmonary arterialdilation, which is not independently influenced by the presence or severity ofILD measured by FVC, TLCO, or disease severity on CT.

"Cognitive Decline, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Presbycusis: Examination of the Possible Molecular Mechanism.",/pubmed/29937713,"The incidences of presbycusis and dementia are high among geriatric diseases.Presbycusis is the general term applied to age-related hearing loss and can becaused by many risk factors, such as noise exposure, smoking, medication,hypertension, family history, and other factors. Mutation of mitochondrial DNA inhair cells, spiral ganglion cells, and stria vascularis cells of the cochlea isthe basic mechanism of presbycusis. Dementia is a clinical syndrome that includesthe decline of cognitive and conscious states and is caused by manyneurodegenerative diseases, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common.The amyloid cascade hypothesis and tau hypothesis are the two major hypothesesthat describe the AD pathogenic mechanism. Recent studies have shown thatdeposition of A_ and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein may causemitochondrial dysfunction. An increasing number of papers have reported that, on one hand, the auditory system function in AD patients is damaged as theircognitive ability declines and that, on the other hand, hearing loss may be arisk factor for dementia and AD. However, the relationship between presbycusisand AD is still unknown. By reviewing the relevant literature, we found that the SIRT1-PGC1_ pathway and LKB1 (or CaMKK_)-AMPK pathway may play a role in thepreservation of cerebral neuron function by taking part in the regulation ofmitochondrial function. Then vascular endothelial growth factor signal pathway isactivated to promote vascular angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brainbarrier integrity. Recently, experiments have also shown that their expressionlevels are altered in both presbycusis and AD mouse models. Therefore, we proposethat exploring the specific molecular link between presbycusis and AD may providenew ideas for their prevention and treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association Between Changes in Splanchnic Hemodynamics and Risk Factors of Portal Venous System Thrombosis After Splenectomy with Periesophagogastric Devascularization.,/pubmed/29937539,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to investigate splanchnic hemodynamicchanges and determine an optimal cutoff value for risk factors of portal venoussystem thrombosis (PVST) after splenectomy with periesophagogastricdevascularization (SPD) in cirrhotic patients with esophageal and gastricvariceal bleeding (EGVB) and portal hypertension (PH). MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on patients who underwent SPD were collected retrospectively from January 2013 toDecember 2017. Color Doppler ultrasound was performed to detect hemodynamicchanges of the hepatic artery, splenic artery, splenic vein, and portal vein inincluded patients (n=60) and healthy volunteers (n=30). Outcomes were comparedbetween preoperative and postoperative biochemical indicators. The cutoff values for hemodynamics were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curve analysis, and univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors of PVST were performed. RESULTS In our series, hemodynamic indexes of splenic artery,spleen vein, and portal vein in the study group were significantly higher thanthat of the control group (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that theportal vein flow and the internal diameter of the portal vein were significantly correlated with PVST. The ROC analysis revealed that the cutoff points for portalvein flow and internal diameter of the splenic vein and portal vein were ³1822.32ml/min, ³1.37 cm, and ³1.56 cm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS SPD is an effectivetreatment in cirrhotic patients with concomitant EGVB and PH by increasinghepatic artery flow and decreasing portal vein flow. High portal vein flow andwider diameters of the portal vein and splenic vein are important markers ofPVST.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Nutrients, Nutraceuticals, and Xenobiotics Affecting Renal Health.",/pubmed/29937486,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8_16% of the population worldwide. Indeveloped countries, the most important risk factors for CKD are diabetes,hypertension, and obesity, calling into question the importance of educating and acting on lifestyles and nutrition. A balanced diet and supplementation canindeed support the maintenance of a general health status, including preservationof renal function, and can help to manage and curb the main risk factors forrenal damage. While the concept of protein and salt restriction in nephrology is historically acknowledged, the role of some nutrients in renal health and theimportance of nutrition as a preventative measure for renal care are less known. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the demonstrated andpotential actions of some selected nutrients, nutraceuticals, and xenobiotics on renal health and function. The direct and indirect effects of fiber, protein,fatty acids, curcumin, steviol glycosides, green tea, coffee, nitrates, nitrites,and alcohol on kidney health are reviewed here. In view of functional andpersonalized nutrition, understanding the renal and systemic effects of dietarycomponents is essential since many chronic conditions, including CKD, are relatedto systemic dysfunctions such as chronic low-grade inflammation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Iatrogenic atrial septal defect post mitral valve in valve implantation.,/pubmed/29937382,"A 75_year-old female with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation of abio-prosthetic valve secondary to valve leaflet perforation due to endocarditisunderwent a mitral valve in valve replacement in an existing Hancock 27_mm valve using a trans-femoral/trans-septal approach. The procedure was complicated by an iatrogenic atrial septal defect post trans-septal puncture causing a severeright-to-left shunt due, possibly, to the combination of severe pulmonaryhypertension and moderate tricuspid regurgitation the patient had suffered fromat base line. Once the sheath was removed an immediate desaturation was observed which required emergent closure with an AMPLATZER ASD Occluder device (St. JudeMedical/Abbott Structural, St. Paul, Minnesota, MN). This stabilized the patient and returned her blood oxygen levels to normal. The case brings forth a rare but important complication that may occur during trans-septal procedures especiallywhen using large sheaths. It emphasizes the importance of properechocardiographic and hemodynamic evaluation prior to such procedures in order tobe prepared for such complications.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Therenal and gastro-intestinal effects occur early in the progression ofintra-abdominal hypertension, and may lead to poor patient outcomes if notidentified. As a direct response to intra-abdominal hypertension, renal function is reduced with remarkable impairment from pressures of around 10_mmHg, oliguria developing at 15_mmHg and anuria developing at 30_mmHg. Intestinalmicro-circulation is significantly reduced by up to 50% with intra-abdominalpressures as low as 15_mmHg. Mucosal and submucosal tissue hypo-perfusion causes considerable damage to the intestinal cells, potentially resulting in bacterialtranslocation, endotoxin release, sepsis and multiple organ failure. The criticalcare nurse plays an important role in the early identification of intra-abdominalhypertension however, without this essential knowledge base and comprehension of intra-abdominal hypertension, clinical signs and symptoms may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted as signs of other critical illnesses.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Risk factors for readmission following ileal pouch-Anal anastomosis: an American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis.,/pubmed/29937009,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify preventable reasons forreadmission and to delineate risk factors for readmission in the perioperativeperiod for patients with chronic ulcerative colitis undergoing ileal pouch-analanastomosis (IPAA).METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of chronic ulcerative colitis undergoingeither total proctocolectomy with IPAA or proctectomy with IPAA were identifiedin the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Programdatabase from 2012-2015. Unplanned 30-d readmissions were reviewed andcategorized by reason for readmission. The unplanned readmission rate within 30Êdwas calculated by the person-days method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazardregression models determined independent risk factors for overall 30-d unplanned readmissions and readmissions sorted by primary readmission diagnosis.RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred one patients had an IPAA performed duringthe study period. The overall unplanned readmission rate was 32.9% per 30person-days. Leading diagnoses for unplanned readmission included infectiouscomplications, dehydration, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Multivariableanalysis found Hispanic white and black/African American race/ethnicity (bothversus non-Hispanic white) to be independently associated with unplanned 30-dreadmission. Obesity, operative time 330+Êmin (versus <189Êmin), and Hispanicwhite race/ethnicity (versus non-Hispanic white) were associated with readmissionfor infectious complications. Age 57+ y (versus age 18-32 y) and hypertensionrequiring medication were associated with readmission for dehydration. Totalproctocolectomy with IPAA (versus proctectomy with IPAA) was associated withreadmission for VTE.CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients undergoing IPAA experience an unplanned 30-dreadmission. Infectious complications and dehydration account for most of theunplanned readmissions. Outpatient pathways to prevent dehydration and the use ofextended VTE prophylaxis after two-stage IPAA may help reduce the rates ofreadmission following IPAA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Development of murine bariatric surgery models: lessons learned.,/pubmed/29937006,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves comorbidities such as diabetes andhypertension and lowers the risk of obesity-related cancers. To better understandthe physiologic and genetic influences of bariatric surgery, a reliable murinemodel is needed that can be extended to genetically engineered mice. Given thecomplexity of these procedures, few researchers have successfully implementedthese techniques beyond larger rodent models. The purpose of our study was todevelop a technically feasible and reproducible murine model for RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Mice were converted to liquid diet perioperatively withoutfasting and housed in groups on raised wire platforms. SG involved significantreduction of stomach volume followed by multilayer repair of the gastrotomy. RYGBprocedure consisted of side-to-side, functional end-to-side bowel anastomoses andexclusion of the stomach medial to the gastroesophageal junction. Sham surgeries consisted of enterotomies and gastrotomy followed by primary repair withoutresection or rerouting. Survival after incorporation of the aforementionedtechniques was 100% in the SG group and 41% in the RYGB group at 1Êmo aftersurgery. Only 26% of RYGB mortality was attributed to leak, obstruction, orstricture; the majority of postoperative mortality was due to stress, dumping, ormalnutrition. Much of the survival challenge for this surgical model was related to perioperative husbandry, which is to be expected given their small stature andpoor response to stress. Utilization of the perioperative and surgical techniquesdescribed will increase survival and feasibility of these technically challengingprocedures, allowing for a better understanding of mechanisms to explain thebeneficial effects of bariatric surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[Age-related modification effect on the association between body mass index and the risk of hypertension: A Cohort Study on Chinese people living in the rural areas].,/pubmed/29936744,"Objective: To study the modification effect of age on the association betweenbody mass index and the risk of hypertension. Methods: People age ³18 years oldwere selected by clusters, from a rural area of Henan province. In total, 20 194 people were recruited at baseline during 2007 and 2008, and the follow-up studywas completed from 2013 to 2014. Logistic regression model was used to assess therisk of incident hypertension by baseline BMI and age-specific BMI. Results:During the 6-year follow-up period, 1 950 hypertensive persons were detected,including 784 men and 1 166 women, with cumulative incidence rates as 19.96%,20.51%, and 19.61%, respectively. Compared with those whose BMI<22 kg/m(2), theRRs of hypertension were 1.09 (0.93-1.27), 1.17 (1.01-1.37), 1.34 (1.14-1.58) and1.31 (1.09-1.56) for participants with BMI as 22-, 24-, 26- and ³28 kg/m(2),respectively. In young and middle-aged populations, the risk of hypertensiongradually increased with the rise of BMI (trend P<0.05). However, in the elderly,the increasing trend on the risk of hypertension risk was not as significantlyobvious (trend P>0.05). Conclusion: The effect of BMI on the incidence ofhypertension seemed to depend on age. Our findings suggested that a weightreduction program would be more effective on young or middle-aged populations, toprevent the development of hypertension.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cellular and subcellular localization of uncoupling protein 2 in the human kidney.,/pubmed/29936692,"The uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is an anion transporter that plays a key role in the control of intracellular oxidative stress. In animal models UCP2downregulation has several pathological sequelae, particularly affecting thevasculature and the kidney. Specifically, in these models kidney damage is highlyfavored in the absence of UCP2 in the context of experimental hypertension.Confirmations of these data in humans awaits further information, as no data are yet available concerning the cell-type and subcellular expression in the humankidney. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the UCP2 proteindistribution in human kidney biopsies. In humans UCP2 is mainly localized inproximal convoluted tubule cells, with an intracytoplasmic punctate staining.UCP2 positive puncta are often localized at the interface between the endoplasmicreticulum and the mitochondria. Glomerular structures do not express UCP2 atdetectable levels. The expression of UCP2 in proximal tubular cells may explaintheir relative propensity to damage in pathological conditions including thehypertensive disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and the risk of subsequent pediatric cardiovascular diseases of the offspring: a population-based cohort study with up to 18 years of follow up.,/pubmed/29936651,"AIMS: The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been increasingworldwide. We aimed to study the effect of GDM on the risk for childhoodcardiovascular morbidity of the offspring.METHODS: A population-based cohort analysis was performed comparing total anddifferent subtypes of cardiovascular related pediatric diagnoses among offspring of mothers with GDM vs. offspring of mothers with no diabetes. The analysisincluded all singletons born between the years 1991-2014. Cardiovascular related morbidities included hospitalizations involving a pre-defined set of ICD-9 codes.Mothers with pregestational diabetes, Infants with congenital malformations,multiple gestations, and perinatal deaths were excluded from the analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to adjust for confounders.RESULTS: The study population included 216197 newborns which met the inclusioncriteria; among them 4.4% (9460) were born to mothers with GDM controlled by dietand exercise (GDM A1) and 0.3% (724) were born to mothers with GDM requiring oraltreatment or insulin (GDM A2). A significant association was noted between GDMand the rate of cardiovascular related hospitalizations (0.97 for GDM A2 vs. 0.57for GDM A1 vs. 0.33 for no GDM, respectively; p_<_0.001). The associationremained significant and independent for GDM A1 only while adjusting for relevantconfounders [adjusted HR_=_1.6 (1.2-2.2); p value 0.001].CONCLUSIONS: A significant association is noted between the GDM and the rate ofcardiovascular hospitalizations of the offspring. However, in our population GDM A1 is an independent risk factor for pediatric cardiovascular morbidity of theoffspring.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Portal hypertension and hypersplenism in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction: Are they related?,/pubmed/29936618,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Portal hypertension (PHT) due to extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) is common in developing countries. Hypersplenism is anear-constant feature of EHPVO, but its significance, unlike in cirrhotics, isunknown. We aimed to study the relationship between hypersplenism and theseverity of PHT in patients with EHPVO.METHODS: This prospective study was done at a tertiary care center from January2014 to August 2015. All patients with EHPVO who underwent a splenectomy and ashunt or devascularization were included. Data regarding clinical profile,preoperative parameters, and intraoperative details were recorded. Thecorrelation was studied between hypersplenism and the intraoperatively measuredportal pressures and markers of PHT.RESULTS: Of the 40 patients studied (mean [SD] age 22.4 [8.4]Êyears),hematological hypersplenism was present in 39 (97.5%). The mean (SD) hemoglobin, total leukocyte counts (TLC), and platelet counts were 9.9 (2.4)Êg/dL, 2971(1239)Êcells/mm3, and 66,400 (32047)Êcells/mm3, respectively. The mean (SD)sonographic spleen volume (SV), splenic weight, and intraoperative portalpressure were 1084.7 (553.9)Êcm3, 1088.7 (454.7)Êg, and 35.6 (5.1)ÊmmHg,respectively. The TLC and platelet counts correlated inversely with the portalpressure. Additionally, the platelet counts correlated negatively with eradicatedvariceal status, SV, and weight; hemoglobin with SV and weight; and TLC with SV. Multivariate analysis showed the platelet counts were an independent predictor ofportal pressures and platelet counts ²_53,500Êcells/mm3 indicated significantlyhigh portal pressures.CONCLUSIONS: The platelet counts showed a significant inverse correlation withportal pressures in patients with EHPVO and may be used as surrogate markers ofPHT. A platelet count ²_53,500Êcells/mm3 is predictive of significantly highpressures.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Management of Subdural Hematomas: Part I. Medical Management of Subdural Hematomas.,/pubmed/29936548,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Subdural hematomas (SDH) represent common neurosurgicalproblem associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and high recurrencerates. SDH incidence increases with age; numbers of patients affected by SDHcontinue to rise with our aging population and increasing number of people takingantiplatelet agents or anticoagulation. Medical and surgical SDH managementremains a subject of investigation.RECENT FINDINGS: Initial management of patients with concern for altered mentalstatus with or without trauma starts with Emergency Neurological Life Support(ENLS) guidelines, with a focus on maintaining ICP <_22ÊmmHg, CPP >_60ÊmmHg, MAP 80-110ÊmmHg, and PaO2 >_60ÊmmHg, followed by rapid sequence intubation ifnecessary, and expedited acquisition of imaging to identify a space-occupyinglesion. Patients are administered anti-seizure medications, and theirantiplatelet medications or anticoagulation may be reversed if neurosurgicalinterventions are anticipated, or until hemorrhage is stabilized on imaging.Medical SDH care focuses on (a) management of intracranial hypertension; (b)maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion; (c) seizure prevention and treatment;(d) maintenance of normothermia, eucarbia, euglycemia, and euvolemia; and (e)early initiation of enteral feeding, mobilization, and physical therapy.Post-operatively, SDH patients require ICU level care and are co-managed byneurointensivists with expertise in treating increased intracranial pressure,seizures, and status epilepticus, as well as medical complications of criticalillness. Here, we review various aspects of medical management with a briefoverview of pertinent literature and clinical trials for patients diagnosed with SDH.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Bioavailable IGF-1 is beneficially associated with biomarkers of endothelial function in young healthy adults: The African-PREDICT study.,/pubmed/29936324,"INTRODUCTION: Low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are associated with endothelial dysfunction, subsequently leading to the development of cardiovascular disease.OBJECTIVE: To better understand the early phases of vascular deterioration in ayoung, healthy population, we investigated, cross-sectionally, whether biomarkersof endothelial function (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascularcell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWFag)) are associated with IGF-1 in a healthy study population forming part of the largerAfrican Prospective study on the Early Detection and Identification ofCardiovascular diseases and Hypertension (African-PREDICT).METHOD: We included 825 black and white men and women (aged 20-30_years) anddetermined IGF-1, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWFag from blood samples. We also measured 24-h blood pressure and health behaviours namely waist circumference, accelerometery, cotinine and gamma glutamyl transferase. We used the IGF-1/IGFBP-3_M ratio as an estimate of bioavailable IGF-1.RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted regression analyses performed in the totalgroup, VCAM-1 associated positively with IGFBP-3 (__=_0.21; p_<_.001) andnegatively with IGF-1/IGFBP-3 (__=_-0.18; p_<_.001).

Potential impact of Helicobacter pylori-related metabolic syndrome on upper and lower gastrointestinal tract oncogenesis.,/pubmed/29936174,"Both Helicobacter pylori infection and metabolic syndrome present significantglobal public health burdens. Metabolic syndrome is closely related to insulinresistance, the major underlying mechanism responsible for metabolicabnormalities, and Helicobacter pylori infection has been proposed to be acontributing factor. There is growing evidence for a potential associationbetween Helicobacter pylori infection and insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and related morbidity, including abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,dyslipidemia, hypertension, all of which increase mortality related tocardio-cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, nonalcoholic fattyliver disease and malignancies. More specifically, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia have been associated with upper and lowergastrointestinal tract oncogenesis. Apart from cardio-cerebrovascular,degenerative diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a number of studiesclaim that Helicobacter pylori infection is implicated in metabolicsyndrome-related Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma development,gastric and duodenal ulcers and gastric oncogenesis as well as lowergastrointestinal tract oncogenesis. This review summarizes evidence on thepotential impact of Helicobacter pylori-related metabolic syndrome ongastroesophageal reflux disease-Barrett's esophagus-esophageal adenocarcinoma,gastric atrophy-intestinal metaplasia-dysplasia-gastric cancer and colorectaladenoma-dysplasia-colorectal cancer sequences.

Cadmium affects blood pressure and negatively interacts with obesity: Findings from NHANES 1999-2014.,/pubmed/29936168,"Inconsistencies are noted regarding the association between cadmium exposure and blood pressure/hypertension and the interaction between cadmium and body massindex (BMI). This study aims to clarify these inconsistencies in a large sample(n_=_32,791) of adults age ³20_years from eight cycles of the US National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey (NHANES, 1999-2014). The cadmium levels in blood(BCd) and urine (UCd) were used as exposure biomarker. Multiple-linear/logisticregression models were built and stratified by sex, ethnicity and BMI category.The interaction between BCd and BMI was assessed on additive and multiplicativescales. A twofold increase in BCd was associated with 0.54_mm_Hg (95% CI: 0.49,0.58) and 0.05_mm_Hg (95% CI: 0.04, 0.06) increases in the systolic bloodpressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively, in black women. The SBP and DBP increased by 0.92_mm_Hg (95% CI: 0.73, 1.11) and 0.85_mm_Hg (95% CI: 0.65, 1.05), respectively, in Mexican-Am women. Significant associations werefound between BCd and hypertension in them (systolic risk per twofold BCd,OR_=_1.31; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.61; and diastolic risk per twofold BCd, OR_=_1.55; 95%CI: 1.17, 2.05). UCd was significantly associated with hypertension in allindividuals (OR_=_1.14 per twofold; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.21).

Profiling plasma N-Acylethanolamine levels and their ratios as a biomarker of obesity and dysmetabolism.,/pubmed/29935920,"OBJECTIVE: N-acylethanolamines play different roles in energy balance; anandamide(AEA) stimulates energy intake and storage, N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)counters inflammation, and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) mediates anorectic signals and lipid oxidation. Inconsistencies in the association of plasmaN-acylethanolamines with human obesity and cardiometabolic risk have emergedamong previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, andby unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterizechanges in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratiosassociated with obesity, menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define thesignificance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.METHODS: Adult, drug-free women (nÊ=Ê103 premenopausal and nÊ=Ê81 menopausal) andmen (nÊ=Ê144) were stratified according to the body mass index (BMI) into normal weight (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9Êkg/m2), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9Êkg/m2), andobese (OB; BMI ³30.0Êkg/m2). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters weredetermined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures forN-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independentinfluence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.RESULTS: BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women andmen, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directlyassociated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA andOEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resultedin increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances inpremenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directlyassociated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered withhypertension in elderly men. Insulin resistance was associated with changes inN-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA andOEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA andOEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels wereassociated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized byimbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination ofN-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identifiedin relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevanceaccording to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means formonitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears apromising target for intervention strategies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Beta-blockers in noncardiac surgery: Did observational studies put us back on safe ground?,/pubmed/29935568,"Based on landmark trials, international guidelines had for years promoted the useof beta-blockers in the setting of non-cardiac surgery. In 2011, concerns wereraised regarding the integrity of some of the landmark trials, as the DutchErasmus Medical Center found some of them to be scientifically incorrect. Basedon the remaining studies that were to be trusted, investigations showed that, in contrast to prior beliefs, the widespread use of perioperative beta-blockersmight be harmful. A call for further investigations into the matter ushered inseveral observational studies evaluating the safety of perioperative beta-blockertherapy in specific patient subgroups. Within this review, we discuss importantaspects for making these decisions, and compare the major observational studiesand specific estimates of risk in subgroups of interest. We conclude thatpatients at high risk with heavy co-morbidities, such as heart failure, maybenefit from beta-blocker therapy, whereas low-risk patients, such as patientswith uncomplicated hypertension, may be at increased risk with beta-blockertherapy. We provide a critical review of current perioperative guidelines in viewof the new observational data, suggesting that the recommended schematics, suchas the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, for risk stratification of patients in thissetting may be suboptimal. Further, we provide discussions of other aspects,including risk of sepsis, type of beta-blocker, and the potential ofperioperative beta-blocker withdrawal, which may be important in guiding futurestudies. Summarising the current evidence, we argue that, after a precariousdecade, we may just now, be back on safe ground.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mendelian randomisation in type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.,/pubmed/29935421,"Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension are associated withanthropometric and biomarker traits, including waist-to-hip-ratio, body massindex and altered glucose and insulin levels.

Theuse of human genetics can quantify the causal effects of long-term exposure tosubtle changes of modifiable risk factors. Mendelian randomisation (MR) useshuman genetic variants associated with the risk factor to quantify therelationship between risk factor and disease outcome.

Control of renal sympathetic nerve activity by neurotransmitters in the spinal cord in goldblatt hypertension.,/pubmed/29935157,"The role of spinal cord neurons in renal sympathoexcitation remains unclear inrenovascular hypertension, represented by the 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) model.Thus, we aimed to assess the influence of spinal glutamatergic and AT1angiotensin II receptors on renal sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA) in 2K1CWistar rats. Hypertension was induced by clipping the renal artery with a silver clip. After six weeks, a catheter (PE-10) was inserted into the subarachnoidspace and advanced to the T10-11 vertebral level in urethane-anaesthetized rats. The effects of intrathecally (i.t.) injected kynurenic acid (KYN) or losartan(Los) on blood pressure (BP) and rSNA were analysed over 2 consecutive hours. KYNinduced a significantly larger drop in rSNA among 2K1C rats than among control(CTL) rats (CTL vs. 2K1C: -8±3 vs. -52±9 spikes/s after 120'). Los also evoked a significantly larger drop in rSNA among 2K1C rats than among CTL rats starting at80' after administration (CTL vs. 2K1C - 80 min: -10±2 vs. -32±6_; 100 min: -15±4vs. -37±9_; 120 min: -12±5 vs. -37±8_ spikes/s). KYN decreased BP similarly inthe CTL and 2K1C groups; however, Los significantly decreased BP in the 2K1Cgroup only. We found upregulation of AT1 gene expression in the T11-12 spinalsegments in the 2K1C group but no change in gene expression for AT2 or ionotropicglutamate (NMDA, kainate and AMPA) receptors. Thus, our data show that spinalionotropic glutamatergic and AT1 receptors contribute to increased rSNA in the2K1C model, leading to the maintenance of hypertension; however, theparticipation of spinal AT1 receptors seems to be especially important in theestablishment of sympathoexcitation in this model. The origins of thoseprojections, i.e., the brain areas involved in establishing the activity ofspinal glutamatergic and angiotensinergic pathways, remain unclear.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Characterization of in vitro metabolites of three tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids in rat liver S9 by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.,/pubmed/29935083,"RATIONALE: Tetrahydroberberine (THB), tetrahydrocoptisine (THCP) andtetrahydrocolumbamine (THCB) belong to the tetrahydroprotoberberine (THPB)alkaloids. Most of them have been extensively studied because of theirpharmacological activities such as anti-hypertension, anti-arrhythmia,antimicrobial activity and antioxidant. However, limited information on thepharmacokinetics and metabolism of the three alkaloids has been reported. Thepurpose of the study was to investigate the in vitro metabolism of THB, THCP and THCB in rat liver S9 by using a rapid and accurate high-performance liquidchromatography-quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometry (HPLC/QqTOF-MS) method.METHODS: The incubation mixture was processed with 15% trichloroacetic acid.Chromatographic separations of three THPB alkaloids and their metabolites wasachieved by HPLC/QqTOF-MS and accurate mass measurements of metabolites wereautomatically performed through data-dependent acquisition in only a 30-minanalysis. The detailed structural elucidations of these metabolites wereperformed by comparing their changes in accurate molecular masses, elementalcompositions and product ions with those of the parent drug.RESULTS: Five, five and four metabolites of THB, THCP and THCB were identified inrat liver S9, respectively. The results show that tO-demethylenation of the9,10-vicinal methoxyl group was the main metabolic pathway of THB and THCB andthat t demethylenation of the two methylenedioxy groups was the main metabolicpathway of THCP. In addition, minor oxidation and methylation reactions couldoccur for these alkaloids in rat liver S9.CONCLUSION: This was the first ever investigation of in vitro metabolism of THB, THCP and THCB in rat liver S9 by using a sensitive and accurate HPLC/QqTOF-MSmethod. The tentatively proposed metabolic pathways of the three alkaloids willprovide a basis for further studies of the in vivo metabolism of the threecompounds in animals and humans.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pulmonary arterial stiffness assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is a predictor of mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.,/pubmed/29934885,"Early detection of mild pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) based on clinicalevaluation and echocardiography remains quite challenging. In addition toenhanced right ventricular (RV) assessment, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)imaging may accurately reflect deleterious remodeling and increased stiffness of the central pulmonary arteries based on pulsatility, or percent change of the PA during the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility ofmeasuring PA pulsatility by CMR as a potential early maker in PAH. We hypothesizethat pulsatility may help discriminate mild PAH from normal control subjects.Consecutive patients with PAH (n_=_51) were prospectively enrolled to receivesame day CMR and right heart catheterization (RHC). PA stiffness indicesincluding pulsatility, distensibility, compliance, and capacitance werecalculated. Comparisons were made between patients with varying severities of PAHand normal controls (n_=_18). Of the 51 subjects, 20 had mild PAH, and 31moderate-severe based on hemodynamic criteria. PA pulsatility demonstrated aprogressive decline from normal controls (53%), mild PAH (22%), tomoderate-severe PAH (17%; p_<_0.001). There was no difference in RV size,function or mass between mild PAH and normal controls. PA pulsatility below 40%had an excellent ability to discriminate between mild PAH and normal controlswith a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 94%.

The association between relevant comorbidities and dementia in patients with atrial fibrillation.,/pubmed/29934733,"Risk of dementia is increased in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimedtoÊstudy associations between relevant comorbidities and prevalent as well asincident dementia in AF patients. Study population included all adults(n_=_12,283) ³_45Êyears diagnosed with AF at 75 primary care centers in Sweden2001-2007. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95%confidence intervals (95% CI) for associations between comorbidities andprevalent dementia. In a subsample (n_=_12,096), (excluding patients withdementiaÊdiagnosed before AF onset), Cox regression was used to estimate hazardratios (HR) with 95% CIs for association between comorbidities, and incidentdementia, after adjustment for age, socioeconomic factors and anticoagulanttreatment. Totally 937 patients (7.6%), 388 men (5.8%) and 549 women (9.7%), werediagnosed with dementia. After adjustments, prevalent dementia was more common in(ORs, 95% CI) men with congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, and depression; inwomen with CHF and depression, and among women >_75Êyears with stroke, but lesscommon in women with hypertension. During a 5.6-year follow-up (standarddeviation 2.5), 750 patients (6.2%; 322 men, 4.9%, and 428 women, 7.8%) werediagnosed with incident dementia. An increased risk of incident dementia wasfound among men with diabetes and depression; a decreased risk among men andwomen with CHF, and among women with hypertension, myocardial infarctioncerebrovascular diseases. The findings regarding incident dementia need to beinterpreted with great caution, as they may have been subject to survival bias.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of the effects of tolvaptan and furosemide on renal water and sodium excretion in patients with heart failure and advanced chronic kidney disease: a subanalysis of the K-STAR study.,/pubmed/29934667,"BACKGROUND: Tolvaptan (TLV) is known to increase electrolyte-free waterclearance. However, TLV actions on renal electrolytes including urine sodium(uNa) excretion and its consequences are less well understood. This subanalysisinvestigated the effect of add-on TLV compared to increased furosemide (FUR) onboth electrolyte-free water and electrolyte clearance in patients with congestiveheart failure (CHF) complicated by advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).METHODS: The Kanagawa Aquaresis Investigators Trial of TLV on HF Patients withRenal Impairment (K-STAR) was a multicenter, open-labeled, randomized, andcontrolled prospective clinical study. Eighty-one Japanese patients with CHF and residual signs of congestion despite oral FUR treatment (³_40Êmg/day) wererecruited and randomly assigned to a 7-day add-on treatment with either²_40Êmg/day FUR or ²_15Êmg/day TLV. Electrolyte-free water clearance, electrolyteosmolar clearance and electrolyte excretion were compared between the two groups before and after therapy.RESULTS: The change (_) in electrolyte-free water clearance was significantlyhigher in the add-on TLV group than in the add-on FUR group. However,_electrolyte osmolar clearance was also higher in the add-on TLV group than inthe increased FUR group. This was primarily because _uNa excretion wassignificantly higher in the add-on TLV group than in the increased FUR group,since _urine potassium excretion was significantly lower in the add-on TLV group than in the increased FUR group.CONCLUSIONS: Add-on TLV may increase both renal water and Na excretion in CHFpatients with advanced CKD to a greater degree than increased FUR.",RCT,,,,Tolvaptan,Furosemide,,,Congestive heart failure complicated by advanced kidney disease,Electrolyte free water and electrolyte clearence,
"Trace proteinuria by dipstick screening is associated with metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes.",/pubmed/29934666,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine the association ofdipstick-determined trace proteinuria with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and itscomponents in each age, gender, and eGFR category among a large generalpopulation.METHODS: A total of 270,190 people (102,223 men and 167,967 women) aged40-74Êyears were included. Subjects were categorized as having negative, trace,and positive proteinuria by the dipstick method.RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS increased with increasing levels of proteinuriain any estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category (odds ratios for MetSrelative to negative proteinuria: 1.22, 1.23, and 1.25 for trace proteinuria, and2.19, 1.81, and 1.80 for positive proteinuria among subjects with eGFR of ³_90,60-89, and 45-59Êml/min/1.73Êm2, respectively). These associations werestatistically significant in each age and sex category. Among MetS components,the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased with increasing levels ofproteinuria (odds ratios for hypertension: 1.23 and 1.87, and odds ratios fordiabetes: 1.28 and 2.18 for trace and positive proteinuria, respectively), which were similarly observed in any eGFR category. There were little or no differencesin the prevalence of abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia (reduced HDL-cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides) between the levels of proteinuria.CONCLUSION: Subjects with dipstick-determined trace proteinuria showedintermediate risk of having MetS, hypertension, and diabetes between negative andpositive proteinuria in any eGFR category in a large general population. Thus,MetS components should be checked for subjects with trace proteinuria even inthose with normal eGFR for the early prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The optimal blood pressure target in diabetes mellitus: a quest coming to an end?,/pubmed/29934621,"The presence of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)substantially increases cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) decrease inthese individuals is associated with large reductions in cardiovascular morbidityand mortality, but the optimal BP levels in DM still remain a matter of importantcontroversy. For almost 20 years, guidelines recommended an office BP target of<130/80_mmHg in diabetic individuals, following evidence from trials randomizing patients to diastolic BP levels. When theaction-to-control-cardiovascular-risk-in-diabetes-blood-pressure (ACCORD-BP)study showed that systolic BP (SBP) <120_mmHg was associated with similar risk toSBP_<_140_mmHg in type 2 DM, all guidelines stepped back to recommend aSBP_<_140_mmHg, despite the obvious limitations of ACCORD-BP, including thesurprisingly low event rate and the actual average BP of 133.5/70.5_mmHg in the""standard-target"" arm. In contrast, thesystolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial (SPRINT) showed cardiovascularbenefits in hypertensive patients without DM randomized to SBP<120 versus<140_mmHg and many believed that absence of between-group differences inACCORD-BP was rather a matter of power and not of dissimilar cardiovascularprofile of diabetic patients. In this regard, theAmerican-College-of-Cardiology/American-Heart-Association 2017 BP guidelinesadvocated a BP target of <130/80 in all hypertensives, including those with DM.However, the 2018 American-Diabetes-Association recommendations were not in thesame direction, suggesting BP goal <140/90 for most patients, with the exception of those with ""high cardiovascular risk"", where a <130/80_mmHg target may apply. This review presents the evidence from old and recent trials relevant to optimal BP levels in DM, aiming to shed light in this major clinical question.",N,,,,,,,,,,
HIF stabilization inhibits renal epithelial cell migration and is associated with cytoskeletal alterations.,/pubmed/29934555,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and potentially lethal complication in the hospitalized patients, with hypoxic injury being as a major cause. The loss ofrenal tubular epithelial cells (TEC), one of the AKI hallmarks, is potentiallyfollowed by tubular regeneration process orchestrated by the remaining uninjured TECs that undergo proliferation and migration. In this study, we used humanprimary TEC to investigate the initiation of tubular cell migration andassociated cytoskeletal alterations in response to pharmacological HIFstabilization which resembles the pathophysiology of hypoxia. Tubular cells have been shown to migrate as cohorts in a wound healing assay. Importantly, cells of distal tubular origin moved faster than those of proximal origin. HIFstabilization impaired TEC migration, which was confirmed by live single celltracking. HIF stabilization significantly reduced tubular cell migration velocityand promoted cell spreading. In contrast to the control conditions, HIFstabilization induced actin filaments rearrangement and cell adhesion moleculesincluding paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. Condensed bundling of keratinfibers was also observed, while the expression of different types of keratins,phosphorylation of keratin 18, and the microtubule structure were not altered. Insummary, HIF stabilization reduced the ability of renal tubular cells to migrate and led to cytoskeleton reorganization. Our data suggested an importantinvolvement of HIF stabilization during the epithelial migration underlying themechanism of renal regeneration in response to AKI.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Overweight and obesity management strategies in survivors of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a systematic review protocol.,/pubmed/29934396,"INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common paediatric cancer.Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (SALL) are at risk ofobesity and related cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes,hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is important toaddress obesity in this population as this may help mitigate futurecardiometabolic comorbidities. In this systematic review, we aim to assesscurrent treatment strategies including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapyand bariatric surgery to manage overweight and obesity in SALL.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following databases for primary studies:CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register ofControlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition,unpublished primary studies will be searched in ClinicalTrials.gov as well asconference proceedings, presentations, abstracts, editorials and ProQuestDissertations and Theses A&I. Reviewers will perform title, abstract, andfull-text screening as well as data abstraction and risk of bias assessmentindependently with a third reviewer to be consulted to resolve disagreements.Searches will be run and updated through May 1st, 2018. The overall quality ofthe evidence will be determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,Development, and Evaluation criteria for each outcome. A meta-analysis will beperformed if two studies deploying similar interventions, populations, and designand outcomes are identified.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As individual patient data will not be included, we do not require ethics approval.

Association Between Hypertensive Disorders During Pregnancy and the Subsequent Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease: A Population-Based Follow-Up Study.,/pubmed/29934233,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (HDPs) areassociated with the subsequent development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).METHODS: The present study included 1 598 043 women who delivered in Canadianhospitals between April 1993 and March 2003. The baseline information was fromthe Canadian Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database.Women with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and other specificconditions were excluded. A follow-up study was conducted through a recordlinkage on their hospitalizations as of the 13th month after the deliverydischarge through March 31, 2013. The primary outcome of interest was subsequent hospitalization due to ESRD. Cox model was used to quantify the associationbetween HDPs and ESRD hospitalization.RESULTS: There occurred 9.9 and 1.7 ESRD hospitalizations per 100 000person-years in the follow-up of HDPs and non-HDP women, respectively. Anincreased risk of ESRD hospitalization was observed in pregnant women withpre-eclampsia/eclampsia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]_=_4.7, 95% CI 3.6-6.0),unspecified HDPs (aHR_=_4.6, 95% CI 2.8-7.7), or gestational hypertension(aHR_=_3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.1). Caesarean delivery, preterm delivery, IUGR, and deepvein thrombosis were identified as significant correlates with the subsequentESRD hospitalization. The risk of subsequent ESRD hospitalization appeared to be lower for women who had ³2 deliveries compared with those who had one deliveryduring the study period.CONCLUSION: Pregnancy complicated with HDPs was significantly associated with an increased risk of ESRD hospitalization in later life, and this association variedby HDP subtype and frequency of delivery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Parkinsonism in a population-based study of individuals aged 75+ years: The PietÌÊ study.,/pubmed/29934195,"INTRODUCTION: Parkinsonism is one of the most prevalent neurological syndromes inthe elderly. There are only a few epidemiological studies focusing onparkinsonism in oldest-old individuals, particularly in Latin America. This studyaims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of parkinsonism insubjects aged 75Ê+Êyears living in the community.METHODS: The Piet study is a population-based investigation on brain agingconducted in Caet, southeast Brazil. A sample composed of 610 community-dwellingindividuals aged 75Ê+Êyears (48.7% of the total population within this age range)underwent clinical, neurological, cognitive and functional assessments.RESULTS: The sample comprised mostly women (61.5%), with mean age of 83.3 yearsand mean schooling of 2.5 years. Parkinsonism was identified in 65 subjects(crude prevalenceÊ=Ê10.7%). Parkinson's disease, ParkinsonismÊ+Êdementiasyndrome, drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism and Lewy-body dementiawere identified in, respectively, 19 (29.2%), 19 (29.2%), 8 (12.3%), 4 (6.1%) and1 (1.5%) subjects. In 14 individuals (21.5%), the etiology of parkinsonism could not be determined. The most important vascular risk factor was hypertension(64.6%).

Body image (dis)satisfaction among low-income adult women.,/pubmed/29934132,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A better understanding of the factors that affectself-perception of body characteristics may play an important role in weightcontrol practices. The objective of this study was to analyze body weightperception and body image satisfaction in low-income adult women in SouthernBrazil.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study in a cohort of women recruitedfrom areas of social vulnerability in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. A randomsample (nÊ=Ê218) of women was interviewed, and socioeconomic and lifestylefactors, body image perception using the Stunkard Scale, body weight estimation, weight concern and duplicate anthropometric measurements were obtained.RESULTS: The average age of the low-income women was 56.3Ê±Ê9.5 years. Theprevalences of overweight and obese individuals were 34.1% and 52.5%,respectively. Among all women, 83.0% were dissatisfied with their body image, and68.9% of the women estimated their body weight correctly. In addition to BMI(body mass index), the proportions of women with a higher income (pÊ=Ê0.05),smoking history (pÊ<Ê0.01) and history of hypertension (pÊ=Ê0.04) weresignificantly different between groups according to body image satisfaction.Multivariate analyses using Poisson regression showed that black/mixed race,higher income, and underweight and obese women were more likely to bedissatisfied with their body image.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women know their body weight and have body imagedissatisfaction. Skin color, higher income and BMI were significantly associated with dissatisfaction. In addition, these women consider the ""healthiest"" bodyimage to be thinner than the ""ideal"" body image, and the ""ideal"" image is one of normal weight and not too thin.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Is there still a role for renal artery stenting in the management of renovascular hypertension - A single-center experience and where do we stand in 2018?,/pubmed/29934065,"BACKGROUND: Renal artery (RA) stenosis has been implicated in thepathophysiological mechanism for resistant hypertension. Despite the increasinglydiagnosed frequency of hemodynamically significant lesions, the value of RArevascularization remains controversial. Our group had previously demonstratedsignificant blood pressure (BP) reduction in a retrospective cohort ofappropriately selected patients undergoing RA stenting up to 18-months offollow-up. We herein present long-term clinical outcomes data 5-years postrevascularization on 26 subjects who continued follow-up at our institution.METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on subjects who underwent RAstenting at our institution for hemodynamically significant (³70%) RA stenosisand systolic hypertension on ³3 antihypertensive agents. Clinical outcome datafor systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), creatininelevel and number of antihypertensive drugs was assessed prior to and then laterat 6-12_months and 3-5_years post RA stenting.RESULTS: Mean age was 69_±_9_years; 27% (7/26) were male. Median follow-up was5.1_years. Blood pressure reduction was sustained at long-term follow-up(135/70_±_18/11_mmHg) compared to initial reduction noted at 6-months(136/69_±_16/8_mmHg; p_²0.01 for both) and from baseline (162/80_±_24/18_mmHg;p_²0.001 for both).

Mangiferin alleviates hypertension induced by hyperuricemia via increasing nitric oxide releases.,/pubmed/29934052,"Mangiferin, a natural glucosyl xanthone, was confirmed to be an effective uricacid (UA)- lowering agent with dual action of inhibiting production and promotingexcretion of UA. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of mangiferin on alleviating hypertension induced by hyperuricemia. Mangiferin (30, 60, 120Êmg/kg)was administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic rats induced by gavage withpotassium oxonate (750Êmg/kg). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum levels of UA,nitric oxide (NO), C-reactionprotein (CRP) and ONOO- were measured. The mRNA and protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), intercellularadhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CRP were also analyzed. Human umbilical veinendothelial cells (HUVECs) were used inÊvitro studies. Administration ofmangiferin significantly decreased the serum urate level and SBP at 8 weeks andlast to 12 weeks. Further more, mangiferin could increase the release of NO anddecrease the level of CRP in blood. In addition, mangiferin reversed the protein expression of eNOS, CRP, ICAM-1 and ONOO- in aortic segments in hyperuricemicrats. The results inÊvitro were consistent with the observed results inÊvivo.Taken together, these data suggested that mangiferin has played an important partin alleviating hypertension induced by hyperuricemia via increasing NO secretion and improving endothelial function.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pseudohyperaldosteronism due to mumijo consumption during pregnancy: a licorice-like syndrome.,/pubmed/29933704,"Herbal supplements are widely used during pregnancy, although there areinsufficient data regarding their efficacy and safety. Some of them have beenassociated with hypertension, including licorice, which induces the so calledmineralocorticoid-excess syndrome, a clinical picture resembling topseudohyperaldosteronism. This action is mediated via inhibition of11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-HSD2), leading to impairedinactivation of cortisol to cortisone, accumulation of cortisol, and finally toexcessive mineralocorticoid activity, especially in the distal and cumulativetubule of kidneys. This syndrome is characterized by hypertension andhypokalemia. Herein, we report a case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman, who wasreferred from obstetrics department to our department due to persistenthypertension and hypokalemia. She consumed a herbal supplement called ""mumijo""during the last 6_months. After a thorough diagnostic work-up, the diagnosis of a""licorice-like syndrome"" due to mumijo consumption was made. Potassiumsupplementation at the acute phase and discontinuation of mumijo were thetreatment of choice. This is the first report of pseudohyperaldosteronism due to mumijo consumption in literature. Clinicians should be aware of this side effect and this agent should be included in those causing pseudohyperaldosteronism.Besides all, our case highlights the undeniable value of a detailed medicalhistory.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Primary surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta in adolescents and adults: intermediate results and consequences of hypertension.,/pubmed/29933438,"OBJECTIVES: Coarctation of the aorta is known to present with hypertension inolder patients; we reviewed our experience and assessed the outcome ofhypertension following surgical correction.METHODS: From April 2004 to date, 43 patients above the age of 12 underwentcoarctation of the aorta repair. The mean age was 20.4_+_9.7_years (maximum56_years); 21 (48.8%) were older than 18_years and 28 (65.1%) were men. Thirty(69.8%) patients had hypertension. Fourteen (32.6%) had a bicuspid aortic valve; 11 (25.6%) had patent ductus arteriosus; 6 (14%) had myxomatous mitral valve; 4(9.3%) had ascending aortic aneurysms; and 2 (4.7%) had descending aneurysms.RESULTS: Surgical correction included resection and interposition of a tube graftin 31 (72.1%), an end-to-end anastomosis in 6 (14%) and patch aortoplasty in 3(7%). Three (7%) patients required an extra-anatomical bypass: 1 had a longsegment coarctation of the aorta, and 2 had a Bentall procedure with anascending-to-descending aortic bypass. Staged procedures were done forconcomitant disease in 4 (9.3%). There was 1 death: a 56-year-old woman died ofrefractory ventricular fibrillation during surgery. Thirty (69.8%) patients were discharged with antihypertensive medication. At a follow-up of 2.8_±_2.2_years(maximum 9.2_years), the number of hypertensive patients decreased (17/36; 47.2%)(P_=_0.042). Univariable predictors for persistence of hypertension revealed the use of an interpositional tube graft for repair (odds ratio 13.855, confidenceinterval 0.000-0.001; P_=_0.001) as an indicator, whereas there were noindependent predictors for persistence of hypertension.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention is warranted irrespective of age and helpscorrect and control hypertension better; however, significant numbers of patientsstill require antihypertensive medication and regular monitoring.

Factors Associated With Inadequate Intraoperative Baseline Lower Extremity Somatosensory Evoked Potentials.,/pubmed/29933262,"PURPOSE: Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring involves the use of variousmodalities, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), to assess theintegrity of the at-risk nervous system during surgeries. Reliable baselinetracings are important because they are data against which future tracings arecompared to detect potential injury. In some cases, adequate baselines may bedifficult to achieve. Therefore, we analyzed several patient-specific factors to determine which variables are associated with inadequate intraoperative SEPbaseline signals.METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective chart review of 631 consecutivepatients who underwent spine or cranial surgeries between 2010 and 2011.Variables analyzed included age, glucose levels, diabetes mellitus type 2,hypertension, hyperlipidemia, height, weight, sex, smoking, preexistingneurologic conditions, surgical history, lower extremity edema, and neurologicexamination findings. Association between these patient factors and baselinelower extremity SEP signals were analyzed.RESULTS: Height, weight, neurologic deficits, lower extremity edema, and history of neurologic disease are each associated with inadequate baseline lowerextremity SEPs after controlling for confounding variables. Baseline signals wereable to be acquired in 94.1% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Adequate baselines are paramount for successful intraoperativeneurophysiologic monitoring. However, certain patient-specific factors areassociated with inadequate baseline SEP signals. Physical examination findingsand a detailed chart review can be done to identify these factors and guideexpectations during monitoring. Further research related to patient-specificfactors amenable to modification can further improve our capacity to protect the nervous system during surgery.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Serum polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases in national US population.,/pubmed/29933236,"BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) as possible cardiovascular disruptersare universally detected in humans. However, evidence from epidemiologicalstudies appears insufficient and ambiguous.OBJECTIVES: We aim to examine the serum PFCs levels and their associations withthe prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related outcomes in generalUS population.METHODS: We investigated the serum levels of 12 major PFCs, includingperfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS),perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)acetate (EPAH), 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetate (MPAH),perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDE), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS),perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHP), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFSA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoic acid(PFDO), in 10,859 participants from the National Health and NutritionalExamination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014. Logistic regression models were used toestimate the associations between serum PFCs and 5 self-reported CVD outcomes,including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,heart attack, and stroke. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate thePFCs and their associations with 8 traditional CVD risk factors like serumtriglyceride and total cholesterol.RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted models, total PFCs were positively associated with total CVD (p for trend_=_0.0166), independent of traditional CVD riskfactors, such as smoking status, diabetes, hypertension and serum cholesterollevel. Compared with reference quartile of total PFCs levels, the multivariableadjusted odds ratios in increasing quartiles were 1.23 [95% confidence interval(CI): 0.91-1.66], 1.47 (95% CI: 1.14-1.89) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.06-1.98) for totalCVD. Similar positive associations were found if considering individual PFCsincluding PFOS, PFUA, MPAH, EPAH, PFDO, PFSA and PFBS. In addition, serum levels of MPAH and PFDO were positively associated with congestive heart failure; PFNA, PFDE, and PFUA were positively associated with coronary heart disease; PFUA andPFDO were positively associated with angina pectoris; and PFNA was positivelyassociated with heart attack.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that exposure to PFCs was positivelyassociated with risk of CVD. Further longitudinal studies are needed to increase our understanding about the role of PFCs exposure in the prevalence of CVD.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Treatment of cyclosporine induced hypertension: Results from a long-term observational study using different antihypertensive medications.,/pubmed/29933079,"Post-transplant hypertension (PTH) is a common complication in cyclosporineimmunosuppressed patients; however choosing the right antihypertensive medicationis challenging. In a long-term observational study (²13y) we examined differentantihypertensive medications on graft/patient survival of kidney recipients with pre-existing and PTH. Altogether thirty-three co-variables were analyzedincluding dose and type of immunosuppressive and antihypertensive medication,co-medications, serum biochemistries and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A Cox-proportional hazard multivariable survival model was developed to detect aHazard Ratio (HR) of 3.0 at the Bonferroni corrected level __=_0.0015.Importantly, a significant relationship between immunosuppressive cyclosporinedose/serum concentration, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and GFR (p_<_0.001) wasobserved with post-transplant hypertension being a major risk factor (HR6.1) for graft/patient survival. Although all medications lowered effectively elevated SBPthe risk of graft failure/death was significantly increased when hypertension wastreated with ACE inhibitors or _-blockers (HR3.3 and 3.1) but not withangiotensin receptor- and/or Ca-channel blockers. Antihypertensive medication wasassociated with a decline in GFR but _-blockers alone or in combination with ARB and/or CCB improved GFR. Neither BMI nor any of the drug combinations used inimmunosuppression, i.e. prednisolone, mycophenolic acid, azathioprine and/orsirolimus influenced patient and/or graft survival while decision tree analysesinformed on complex dependencies between immunosuppressive medications, dose ofanti-hypertensive drug and diuretics in the management of hypertension. Inconclusion, our study is suggestive for graft/patient survival to be influencedby the class of antihypertensive medication. A prospective randomized clinicaltrial is needed to confirm the results.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Saponins from sea cucumber and their biological activities.,/pubmed/29932674,"Sea cucumbers, belonging to the phylum Echinodermata, have been valued forcenturies as a nutritious and functional food with various bioactivities.

Thisreview summarizes current research on the structure and activities of seacucumber saponins based on the physiological and pharmacological activities from source, experimental models, efficacy and mechanisms, which may provide avaluable reference for the development of sea cucumber saponins.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Perinatal outcomes following labor induction with dinoprostone in pregnancies with borderline amniotic fluid index at term: A clinical observation study.,/pubmed/29932485,"AIM: To compare perinatal outcomes of dinoprostone for induced labor inpregnancies with a borderline versus normal amniotic fluid index (AFI) at term,and to investigate the related factors affecting outcomes of cesarean section.METHODS: The retrospective study was carried out in Hubei Maternal and ChildHealth Hospital with singleton pregnancies of 37-42_weeks' gestation from Januaryto August 2016. A total of 992 subjects were divided into two groups: borderline AFI group (n_=125) with 5_<_AFI_²_8 and normal AFI group (n_=_867) with8_<_AFI_²_24.RESULTS: Time to delivery (P_=0.004) and use of oxytocin augmentation (P_=_0.011)were significantly lower in pregnancies with borderline AFI. There were nosignificant differences between the two groups in terms of delivery mode, time toonset of labor, fetal distress, Apgar scores, meconium-stained amniotic fluid,birth weight, or incidences of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Gestational hypertension and birth weight were the major factors affectingoutcomes of cesarean section in the borderline group (odds ratio [OR]_=_13.61,95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96-94.49, P_=0.008 and OR_=_1.003, 95% CI1.001-1.005, P_=0.001, respectively). Maternal age (OR_=_1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19, P_<_0.001), parity (OR_=_7.57, 95% CI 3.05-18.76, P_<_0.001), biparietal diameter(OR_=_0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.91, P_=_0.021), and meconium-stained amniotic fluid(OR_=_1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.17, P_=_0.009) were related factors in the normalgroup.CONCLUSION: The perinatal outcomes of dinoprostone for induced labor arecomparable between the two groups. Gestational hypertension and birth weight are factors related to outcomes of cesarean section in the borderline group.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Comparison of flow diversion with clipping and coiling for the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms in 115 patients.,/pubmed/29932380,"OBJECTIVE Paraclinoid aneurysms represent approximately 5% of intracranialaneurysms (Drake et al. [1968]). Visual impairment, which occurs in 16%-40% ofpatients, is among the most common presentations of these aneurysms (Day [1990], Lai and Morgan [2013], Sahlein et al. [2015], and Silva et al. [2017]).Flow-diverting stents, such as the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED), areincreasingly used to treat these aneurysms, in part because of their theoretical reduction of mass effect (Fiorella et al. [2009]). Limited data on paraclinoidaneurysms treated with a PED exist, and few studies have compared outcomes ofpatients after PED placement with those of patients after clipping or coiling.METHODS The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 115 patients with ananeurysm of the cavernous to ophthalmic segments of the internal carotid arterytreated with clipping, coiling, or PED deployment between January 2011 and March 2017. Postoperative complications were defined as new neurological deficit,aneurysm rupture, recanalization, or other any operative complication thatrequired reintervention. RESULTS A total of 125 paraclinoid aneurysms in 115patients were treated, including 70 with PED placement, 23 with coiling, and 32with clipping. Eighteen (14%) aneurysms were ruptured. The mean aneurysm size was8.2 mm, and the mean follow-up duration was 18.4 months. Most aneurysms werediscovered incidentally, but visual impairment, which occurred in 21 (18%)patients, was the most common presenting symptom. Among these patients, 15 (71%) experienced improvement in their visual symptoms after treatment, including 14(93%) of these 15 patients who were treated with PED deployment. Completeangiographic occlusion was achieved in 89% of the patients. Complications wereseen in 17 (15%) patients, including 10 (16%) after PED placement, 2 (9%) aftercoiling, and 5 (17%) after clipping. Patients with incomplete aneurysm occlusion had a higher rate of procedural complications than those with complete occlusion (p = 0.02). The rate of postoperative visual improvement was significantly higheramong patients treated with PED deployment than in those treated with coiling (p = 0.01). The significant predictors of procedural complications were incompleteocclusion (p = 0.03), hypertension, (p = 0.04), and diabetes (p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS In a large series in which patient outcomes after treatment ofparaclinoid aneurysms were compared, the authors found a high rate of aneurysmocclusion and a comparable rate of procedural complications among patientstreated with PED placement compared with the rates among those who underwentclipping or coiling. For patients who presented with visual symptoms, thosetreated with PED placement had the highest rate of visual improvement. Theresults of this study suggest that the PED is an effective and safe modality for treating paraclinoid aneurysms, especially for patients who present with visualsymptoms.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Improved brachial artery shear patterns and increased flow-mediated dilation after low-volume high-intensity interval training in type 2 diabetes.,/pubmed/29932275,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Endothelial function isimpaired because of increased oscillatory and retrograde shear in patients withtype 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether low-volume high-intensity intervaltraining and continuous moderate intensity exercise can modulate oscillatory and retrograde shear, blood flow and flow-mediated arterial dilation in thesepatients. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that low-volumehigh-intensity interval training, by increasing anterograde shear and decreasing retrograde shear and oscillatory index, can increase nitric oxide production and consequently result in increased flow-mediated dilation and outward arterialremodelling in patients with type 2 diabetes.ABSTRACT: Atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes is characterized byendothelial dysfunction associated with impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD) andincreases retrograde and oscillatory shear. The present study investigatedendothelium-dependent vasodilation and shear rate in patients with type 2diabetes at baseline and follow-up after 12Êweeks of low-volume high-intensityinterval training (LV-HIIT) or continuous moderate intensity training (CMIT).Seventy five sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes and untreated pre- or stage I hypertension were randomly divided into LV-HIIT, CMIT and control groups. TheLV-HIIT group intervention was 12 intervals of 1.5Êmin at 85%-90% HRmax and 2Êminat 55%-60% HRmax . The CMIT group intervention was 42Êmin of exercise at 70%HRmax for 3 sessions per week during 12Êweeks. High-resolution Doppler ultrasoundwas used to measure FMD, arterial diameter, anterograde and retrograde blood flowand shear rate patterns. Brachial artery FMD increased significantly in theLV-HIIT group (3.83Ê±Ê1.13 baseline, 7.39Ê±Ê3.6% follow-up), whereas there wereno significant increase in the CMIT group (3.45Ê±Ê0.97 baseline, 4.81Ê±Ê2.36%follow-up) compared to the control group (3.16Ê±Ê0.78 baseline, 4.04Ê±Ê1.28%follow-up) (PÊ<Ê0.05). Retrograde shear in the LV-HIIT group decreasedsignificantly (PÊ<Ê0.05), and no significant decrease in retrograde shear wasseen in the CMIT group. Anterograde shear after LV-HIIT increased significantly(PÊ<Ê0.05) but was unchanged in the CMIT group. However, oscillatory shear index in both exercise groups decreased significantly (PÊ=Ê0.029). Nitrite/nitrate(NOx) level increased in both exercise groups, but the increase was greater inthe LV-HIIT group (PÊ<Ê0.001). Our results indicate that by increasing NOx, HIIT decreases the oscillatory shear-induced improvement in FMD and outward arteryremodelling in patients with T2D.

"Risk Factors for Advanced Colorectal Neoplasms in the Proximal Colon in 6,218 Subjects Undergoing Complete Colonoscopy.",/pubmed/29932241,"BACKGROUND: Proximal migration of colonic lesion has been observed; however, riskfactors of lesions in the proximal colon remain uncertain. This study aimed toinvestigate risk factors of lesions in the proximal colon.METHODS: Consecutive subjects with complete colonoscopy were included. Theprimary outcome was risk factors associated with advanced neoplasm (AN) andserrated lesion in the proximal colon. Age, gender, first degree relative (FDR)with colorectal cancer (CRC), smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index,hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease and the use of aspirin,non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and anticoagulants were fitted into a regression model, with reference to subjects without colonic finding. Results were measured by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).RESULTS: Among 6,218 subjects (mean age 56.65 ±6.15 years; 46.8% male), 352(5.7%) had AN; 809 (13.0%) had serrated lesions, and 3,648 (58.7%) had no colonicfinding. There were 148 (2.4%) and 235 (3.8%) subjects having AN and serratedlesion in the proximal colon. Age³50 (OR:13.30; 95%CI:1.85-95.76), male (OR:1.82;95%CI:1.26-2.62), FDR with CRC (OR:2.12; 95%CI:1.43-3.15) and hypertension(OR:1.86; 95%CI:1.30-2.68) were associated with AN in the proximal colon.

(-)-Epicatechin Reduces Blood Pressure and Improves Left Ventricular Function and Compliance in Deoxycorticosterone Acetate-Salt Hypertensive Rats.,/pubmed/29932135,"(&minus;)-Epicatechin (E) is a flavanol found in green tea and cocoa and has beenshown to attenuate tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;)-mediatedinflammation, improve nitric oxide levels, promote endothelial nitric oxidesynthase (eNOS) activation and inhibit NADPH oxidase. This study investigated theeffect of 28 days of low epicatechin dosing (1 mg/kg/day) on the cardiovascularfunction of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Wistarrats (n = 120, 8 weeks of age) underwent uninephrectomy and were randomised into four groups (uninephrectomy (UNX), UNX + E, DOCA, DOCA + E). DOCA and DOCA + Erats received 1% NaCl drinking water along with subcutaneous injections of 25 mg deoxycorticosterone-acetate (in 0.4 mL of dimethylformamide) every fourth day.UNX + E and DOCA + E rats received 1 mg/kg/day of epicatechin by oral gavage.Single-cell micro-electrode electrophysiology, Langendorff isolated-heartassessment and isolated aorta and mesenteric organ baths were used to assesscardiovascular parameters. Serum malondialdehyde concentration was used as amarker of oxidative stress. Myocardial stiffness was increased and leftventricular compliance significantly diminished in the DOCA control group, andthese changes were attenuated by epicatechin treatment (p < 0.05). Additionally, the DOCA + E rats showed significantly reduced blood pressure and malondialdehydeconcentrations; however, there was no improvement in left ventricularhypertrophy, electrophysiology or vascular function. This study demonstrates the ability of epicatechin to reduce blood pressure, prevent myocardial stiffeningand preserve cardiac compliance in hypertrophied DOCA-salt rat hearts.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Circulating levels of 3-hydroxymyristate, a direct quantification of endotoxemia in non-infected cirrhotic patients.",/pubmed/29931819,"BACKGROUND&AIMS: The quantification of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in biologicalfluids is challenging. We aimed to measure plasma LPS concentration using a newmethod of direct quantification of 3-hydroxymyristate (3-HM), a lipid componentof LPS, and to evaluate correlations between 3-HM and markers of liver function, endothelial activation, portal hypertension and enterocyte damage.METHODS: Plasma from 90 non-infected cirrhotic patients (30 Child-Pugh [CP]-A, 30CP-B, 30 CP-C) was prospectively collected. The concentration of 3-HM wasdetermined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with MassSpectrometry.RESULTS: 3-HM levels were higher in CP-C patients (CP-A/CP-B/CP-C: 68/70/103ng/mL, p=0.005). Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (n=16; 113 vs 74 ng/mL,p=0.012), diabetic patients (n=22; 99 vs 70 ng/mL, p=0.028) and those notreceiving beta-blockers (n=44; 98 vs 72 ng/mL, p=0.034) had higher levels of3-HM. We observed a trend towards higher baseline levels of 3-HM in patients withhepatic encephalopathy (n=7; 144 vs 76 ng/mL, p=0.45) or SIRS (n=10; 106 vs 75ng/mL, p=0.114). In multivariate analysis, high levels of 3-HM were associatedwith CP (OR=4.39; 95%CI=1.79-10.76) or MELD (OR=8.24; 95%CI=3.19-21.32) scores.Patients dying from liver insufficiency (n=6) during a 12-month follow-up hadhigher baseline levels of 3-HM (106 vs 75 ng/mL, p=0.089).CONCLUSIONS: In non-infected cirrhotic patients, 3-HM arises more frequently withimpairment of liver function, heavy alcohol consumption, diabetic status, non-useof beta-blockers, and a trend towards poorer outcome is also observed. The directmass-measurement of LPS using 3-HM appears reliable to detect transientendotoxemia and promising to manage the follow-up of cirrhotic patients. Thisarticle is protected by copyright.

Tackling Clinical inertia: The use of co-production to improve patient engagement.,/pubmed/29931752,"Clinical inertia is common in all chronic diseases including diabetes. Despitethe advent of newer agents for the management of hyperglycaemia, hypertension anddyslipidaemia, the number of people with diabetes hitting all three targetsremains small. The causes of clinical inertia are multifactorial, withcontributory elements from people with diabetes, physicians, and the systemwithin which they work. Every healthcare provider should havethe best interest oftheir patients at heart;most people with diabetes want to maintain their healthfor as long as possible; and the maintenance of good health is not only thepurpose of the system, but also the most cost-effective strategy. It is thethesis of this article that a potential reversible contributor to clinicalinertia is the communication amongthese individual elements, which can be called ""co-production"". The co-production model of open communication encouragesdiscourse, allowing the person with diabetes to understand their diagnosis andtherefore better engage in treatment options. Improving engagement allows thehealthcare team - including the physician and the person with diabetes - toestablish shared goalsthatare important to all team members, and to agree toacceptable side effects or risks of interventions in order to achieve thesegoals. Everyone needsto acknowledge that non-adherence exists and can be anissue, thereby allowing reasons to be explored. Only once the person withdiabetes is allowed to take full ownership of their disease and activelyparticipate in decision making can they take control of their disease, therebyimproving outcomes.

Evaluation of aortic stiffness by a new simplified 2D speckle tracking analysis.,/pubmed/29931554,"Arterial stiffness is a marker of cardiovascular damage and an independentpredictor of major cardiovascular events, usually assessed via Carotid-FemoralPulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV). The aim of this study was to test the feasibilityand usefulness of aortic strain analysis using a simplified transthoracicechocardiography (TTE) speckle-tracking (ST) based method. 60 consecutivepatients with normal blood pressure and aortic dimensions underwent TTE and cfPWVevaluation. Strain analysis was performed on the largest section of the ascendingaorta (aA) with a dedicated software; three couples of speckles were identifiedwithin the anterior and posterior aortic wall and transverse segments connecting each couple traced. Peak ascending Aorta Strain (PaAS) was defined as theaveraged peak percentage deformation of these segments during the cardiac cycle; aortic stiffness index _2 was defined as 100___Ln(SBP/DBP)/PaAS. 17 patients wereexcluded for suboptimal TTE images. In the 43 analyzed individuals (male 58%, age63 years) PaAS was 5.5 [3.7-8.6] % with excellent inter and intra observerreproducibility (ICC 95% for both). PaAS showed significant correlation with age (r_=_-_0.64), aA diameter (r_=_-_0.45), cfPWV (r_=_-_0.41), stroke volume(r_=_-_0.41) and heart rate (r_=_-_0.49). Age remained the only independentdeterminant of PaAS in a multivariate analysis. _2 (10.8 [5.9-15.0]) showedsignificant direct correlation with age, Pulse pressure, aA diameter and cfPWV. Asimplified strain analysis of the ascending aorta is technically feasible withgood reproducibility; PaAS and _2 index correlate well with establishedparameters of arterial stiffness and might represent a new index in evaluatingvascular biomechanics.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Discrepancies Between BMI and Classic Cardiovascular Risk Factors.,/pubmed/29931482,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is related to increased cardiovascular risk. It is unknownwhether increasing levels of obesity also increase levels of cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation. This study describes the relationship between classic cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory markers with BMI in a group of obese and non-obese subjects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Obese subjects (BMI ³_30Êkg/m2; n_=_576; mean ± SD BMI43.8_±_7.58Êkg/m2) scheduled for bariatric surgery were included. The referencepopulation consisted of non-obese volunteers (BMI < 30Êkg/m2; n_=_377, BMI25.0_±_2.81Êkg/m2). The relationship between BMI quintiles and the levels ofcardiovascular risk factors was analyzed. Adipose tissue volumetry was performed in 42 obese subjects using abdominal CT scans.RESULTS: The obese group included more women and subjects with type 2 diabetesmellitus, hypertension, and current smoking behavior. In obese subjects, HDL-Cand triglycerides decreased with increasing BMI. Systolic and diastolic bloodpressure, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apoB were not related to BMI in the obesegroup, in contrast to the non-obese group. Inflammatory markers CRP, leukocytecount, and serum complement C3 increased with increasing BMI in the obese group, while these relations were less clear in the non-obese group. The subcutaneousadipose tissue surface was positively correlated to BMI, while no correlation wasobserved between BMI and visceral adipose tissue.CONCLUSIONS: Markers of inflammation are strongest related to BMI in obesesubjects, most likely due to increased adipose tissue mass, while cardiovascular risk factors do not seem to deteriorate above a certain BMI level. Limitedexpansion capacity of visceral adipose tissue may explain these findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induced Hypertension.,/pubmed/29931399,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this paper is to identify commonly usedtyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are associated with hypertension,primarily, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway (VSP)inhibitors. We review the incidence, mechanism, and strategies for management of TKI-induced HTN. We hope to provide clinicians with guidance on how to managesimilar clinical scenarios.RECENT FINDINGS: Many of the newer VSP inhibitors are reviewed here, includingcediranib, axitinib, pazopanib, and ponatinib. Trials utilizing prophylactictreatment with angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs) are discussed as well asrecent data showing an improvement in overall survival and progression-freesurvival in patients on ASIs and TKI-induced hypertension. The incidence ofTKI-induced HTN among the VEGF inhibitors ranges from 5 to 80% and is dosedependent. Newer generation small-molecule TKIs has a lower incidence. Themechanism of action involves VSP inhibition, leading to decreased nitric oxideand increased endothelin production, which causes vasoconstriction, capillaryrarefaction, and hypertension. ASIs and calcium channel blockers are first-linetherapy for treatment and are associated with improved overall survival. Nitratesand beta-blockers are associated with in vitro cancer regression; however, there is a paucity of trials regarding their use as an anti-hypertensive agent in theTKI-induced HTN patient population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Osteoarthritis, Knee.",/pubmed/29939661,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage. It ismost common in elderly women and men. KneeÊosteoarthritisÊcan be divided into twotypes, primary and secondary. PrimaryÊosteoarthritisÊis articular degenerationwithout any apparent underlying reason. SecondaryÊosteoarthritisÊis theconsequence of either an abnormal concentration of force across the joint as withpost-traumatic causes or abnormal articular cartilage, such as rheumatoidarthritis (RA). OsteoarthritisÊis typically a progressive disease that mayeventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may varyfrom each individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time. The rate of progression also varies for eachindividual. Common clinical symptoms include knee pain that is gradual in onsetand worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain after prolongedsitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment forkneeÊosteoarthritisÊbegins with conservative methods and progresses to surgicaltreatment options when conservative treatment fails. While medications can helpslow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no provendisease-modifying agents for the treatment of kneeÊosteoarthritisÊcurrentlyexist.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma adiponectin levels are associated with circulating inflammatory cytokines in autoantibody positive first-degree relatives of rheumatoid arthritis patients.,/pubmed/29940013,"BACKGROUND: Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA),potentially due to systemic inflammation, include cardiovascular disease andsarcopenic obesity. Adiponectin, an adipose-derived cytokine, has been implicatedin inflammatory processes in RA, but little is known regarding its associationwith inflammation in a pre-clinical period. Therefore, we investigated whetheradiponectin was associated with inflammatory markers in individuals at risk forRA, and whether RA-related autoimmunity modifies these associations.METHODS: We analyzed samples from 144 first-degree relatives (FDRs) of RAprobands, of whom 23 were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodyand/or ³ 2 rheumatoid factor isotypes (IgM, IgG or IgA). We called this phenotypethe 'high risk autoantibody profile (HRP)' as it has been shown in prior work to be >96% specific for future RA. We measured adiponectin, cytokines, andhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Using linear mixed effects models,we evaluated interaction between HRP positivity and adiponectin on inflammatorymarkers, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, pack-years smoking, and use of cholesterol-lowering medications.RESULTS: In everyone, adiponectin concentration was inversely associated withhsCRP and IL-1_ in adjusted models, where a 1% higher adiponectin was associated with a 26% lower hsCRP (p = 0.04) and a 26% lower IL-1_ (p = 0.04). Significantinteractions between HRP and adiponectin for associations with GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-9 were detected in fully adjusted models (p = 0.0006, p = 0.006, p = 0.01,respectively). In HRP positive FDRs but not HRP negative FDRs, a 1% higheradiponectin was associated with 97% higher GM-CSF, 73% higher IL-6, and 54%higher IL-9 concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin associates with inflammatory markers, and theseassociations differ in individuals with a high-risk autoantibody profile comparedwith those without. The interaction between adiponectin and autoimmunity warrantsfurther investigation into the potential systemic effects of RA-relatedautoantibodies and adiponectin on inflammation in the absence of clinicallyapparent RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparison of Ultrasound, Radiography, and Clinical Investigations in the Diagnosis of Early Rheumatoid Synovitis in Patients with Nonspecific Musculoskeletal Symptoms: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.",/pubmed/29939979,"BACKGROUND Early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid synovitis can reduce theprogression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, in the early stages ofrheumatoid synovitis, patients may only have non-specific musculoskeletalsymptoms, and plain film radiographs may not detect early synovial changes. Theaim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasoundwith radiography, and clinical investigations in the detection of rheumatoidsynovitis in patients presenting with nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms.MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a non-randomized, cross-sectional, clinical studythat included 189 patients who had nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms. Allpatients underwent clinical investigations, postero-anterior and dorsalradiographic imaging, and bilateral grey-scale ultrasound examinations of thethird and second metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, the third and the secondproximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, the second and the fifthmetatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, and the wrist. RESULTS There was no clearpredictive value for detection of early synovitis by clinical investigationsalone. Plain film radiography of patients only provided accurate information ofjoint erosions but less information for synovitis. Grey-scale ultrasound was moreeffective at detecting early synovitis compared with clinical investigations(p=0.00015; q=4.548) and compared with plain film radiography (p=0.0002;q=4.537), and quantified the synovial changes.

"Placement of selected new FDA-approved drugs in Medicare Part D formularies, 2009-2013.",/pubmed/29939507,"OBJECTIVES: To assess formulary decisions by Part D plans for selected newlyapproved drugs.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.METHODS: Formulary placement and restrictions were identified for 33 drugs in 8therapeutic classes (antihyperglycemics, anticoagulants, antiplatelets,disease-modifying agents for multiple sclerosis [MS] and rheumatoid arthritis[RA], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] drugs, antiepileptics, andantipsychotics) in 863 Part D plans with continuous CMS contracts between 2009and 2013. Multivariable models estimated the impact of drug characteristics andPart D plan characteristics on probability of drug adoption and, for adopters,evaluated factors associated with months to adoption and requirements for priorauthorization (PA) or step therapy (ST).RESULTS: First Part D formulary placements varied from 2 to 14 months post FDAapproval. On average, 56.7% of plans placed each drug within 6 months and 64.1%placed within 1Êyear of the National Drug Code assignment date. The most rapidadoption was for antipsychotics and antiepileptics. TheÊslowest was for COPDdrugs. More than 90% of disease-modifying agents for MS and RA were subject toPA. ST was uncommon except for antihyperglycemic agents. In adjusted analyses,enhanced benefit plans had a 4% higher probability of formulary placement (P<.01), and each additional star in the CMS star rating system increased theprobability of adoption by 4% (P <.01). Overall, Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans had higher placement rates due to greater reliance on enhanced planofferings and higher star ratings.CONCLUSIONS: We found significant heterogeneity in formulary placement andrestrictions for 33 new drugs in the Part D marketplace between 2009 and 2013.Further research is necessary to determine whether this pattern applies to other drug classes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Rasch measurement in rheumatoid arthritis: deriving psychometrically optimal measures from the Rasch Everyday Activity Limitation item bank.,/pubmed/29939313,"Objective: Recently we developed the Rasch Everyday Activity Limitations (REAL)generic item bank for measuring physical function. In this study we evaluate the REAL item bank in 209 RA patients and demonstrate how computerized adaptivetesting (CAT) and Optimal Test Assembly methods can be used to derive measuresfrom the REAL item bank with superior measurement performance compared with theHAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI).Methods: Structural validity of the item bank was assessed using confirmatoryfactor analysis. The validity of the REAL score metric in RA was evaluated byexamining differential item functioning against the general populationcalibration sample. Besides the REAL-CAT, a 6-item short form (REAL-6) wasdeveloped using Optimal Test Assembly that was optimized with respect to commondisability levels in RA, content and reading ease. Measurement precision of thedifferent instruments was examined using item response theory methods. Construct validity was evaluated by testing hypothesized correlations with externalmeasures.Results: Good model-data fit was observed for a one-dimensional model and onlytwo items showed differential item functioning of substantial magnitude. TheREAL-CAT had superior measurement precision compared with HAQ-DI and REAL-6.REAL-6 outperformed HAQ-DI across all but the very lowest level of physicalfunction. All three instruments demonstrated good construct validity (>75% ofhypotheses affirmed) and only HAQ-DI had a ceiling effect (23.9%).Conclusion: This study supports the validity of the REAL item bank andillustrates the potential of CAT and OTA applications based on the REAL item bankfor assessing physical function in RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Combination Effect of Anti-Rheumatic Medications for Coronary Artery Diseases Risk in Rheumatoid Arthritis : A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.,/pubmed/29939099,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a combination of anti-rheumatic drugs isassociated with the risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD) on incident rheumatoidarthritis (RA) patients.METHODS: This population-based cohort study used administrative data to identify 6260 newly diagnosed patients with RA (age ³20 years) as the study group. Thestudy endpoint was occurrence of CAD according to the ICD-9-CM codes. Exposure todifferent combinations of drugs and the risk of CAD was assessed. These included different combinatiosn of celecoxib(Cx), hydroxychloroquine(HCQ),methotrexate(MTX), and sulfasalazine(SSZ). Patients who never used Cx, HCQ, MTX, or SSZ were used as a reference group. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of disease after controlling for demographicand other co-morbidities. When the proportionality assumption was violated, thespline curve of the Scaled Schoenfeld residuals was fitted to demonstrate theestimated effect on CAD over time for drug usage.RESULTS: Among RA patients, the adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) of CAD for ""Cx only"", ""Cx and HCQ ever"", and ""Cx, HCQ, MTX, and SSZ ever"", were 0.29 (0.19, 0.44), 0.46 (0.24, 0.88), and 0.42 (0.24, 0.75), respectively, during the firstperiod of 0-3, 4, or 7 years.

The adjusted HR (95% CI) of CAD for ""Cx, MTX, and SSZ ever""remains constant at 0.12 (0.02, 0.89).CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib-DMARDs drugs combinations were associated with reduced CADrisk on incident RA patients and some of them exhibited the time-varying drugeffect.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Reduction of CD83 expression on B Cells and the genetic basis for rheumatoid arthritis: Comment on the article by Thalayasingam et al.,/pubmed/29938925,"In ""CD4+ and B lymphocyte expression quantitative traits at rheumatoid arthritis risk loci in untreated early arthritis: implications for causal geneidentification,"" Thalayasingam etÊal (1) reported that the 6p23 locus, associatedwith rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has a B cell-specific eQTL effect on CD83. The B cell-specific eQTL effect at this locus is robust and has also been reported inother studies (2), and this locus presumably contributes to the pathogenesis ofRA by decreasing the expression of CD83 on B cells. Here, we sought to determine the basis for the B cell-specific eQTL effect and the mechanism by which thiseQTL effect contributes to the pathogenesis of RA.Publicly available epigenomicdata showed that the RA GWAS lead SNP, rs12529514 (3), resides near a DNasehypersensitivity site in B cells (4) (Figure 1A).

Prevalence and Characteristics of Persistent Clonal T-LGL Expansions in Rheumatoid Arthritis: a Comprehensive Analysis of 529 Patients.,/pubmed/29938921,"OBJECTIVE: Up to one third of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyteleukemia (T-LGL-leukemia) display symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). InCrohn's disease and in psoriasis treatment with TNF_-inhibitors is associatedwith hepatosplenic __T-cell-lymphoma and with clonal expansion of __T-cells,respectively. Here, we determine the prevalence of clonal T-LGL cells in patientswith RA and define risk factors for this rare hematologic malignancy.METHODS: 529 RA-patients were recruited between November, 2013 and August, 2015. Eight color flow cytometry (FACS) was performed to screen for aberrant T-cellpopulations of large granular lymphocytes. Molecular analysis of the T-cellreceptor was used to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suggestive FACSfindings. Electronic patient files were used to determine risk factors. Patients with clonal populations were monitored prospectively for up to 4 years.RESULTS: The median patient age was 61 years, 74% were female. The median diseaseduration of RA was 12.0 years. Median DAS28 was 2.8. 69.9% have ever been treatedwith biologic DMARDs. We identified clonal T-LGL expansions in 19 patientsequaling a prevalence of 3.5%. The T-LGL cell clone is constant over time in mostpatients and is significantly associated with the duration of the exposure toTNF_-blocking agents (p-value 0.01). No other risk factors could be detected.CONCLUSION: RA-patients with long term exposure to TNF_-blocking agents were at agreater risk of developing clonal expansions of large granular lymphocytes. This finding may prompt clinicians to refrain from using these substances in RApatients with known T-cell aberrations. This article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"LJ-1888, a selective antagonist for the A3 adenosine receptor, ameliorates the development of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia in apolipoprotein E knock-out mice.",/pubmed/29936931,"Cardiovascular diseases arising from atherosclerosis are the leading causes ofmortality and morbidity worldwide. Lipid-lowering agents have been developed inorder to treat hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis.However, the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing, indicating aneed to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop new treatment agents.Adenosine receptors (ARs) are emerging as therapeutic targets in asthma,rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, ischemia, and inflammatory diseases. This studyassessed whether LJ-1888, a selective antagonist for A3 AR, can inhibit thedevelopment of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE-/-) mice whoare fed a western diet. Plaque formation was significantly lower in ApoE-/- mice administered LJ-1888 than in mice not administered LJ-1888, without anyassociated liver damage. LJ-1888 treatment of ApoE-/- mice prevented westerndiet-induced hypercholesterolemia by markedly reducing low-density lipoproteincholesterol levels and significantly increasing high-density lipoproteincholesterol concentrations. Reduced hypercholesterolemia in ApoE-/- miceadministered LJ-1888 was associated with the enhanced expression of genesinvolved in bile acid biosynthesis. These findings indicate that LJ-1888, aselective antagonist for A3 AR, may be a novel candidate for the treatment ofatherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Rheumatoid factor isotype and Ro epitope distribution in primary SjÌ¦gren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.,/pubmed/29936570,"Primary Sjgren syndrome (pS) is associated with autoantibodies such asrheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies such as anti-Ro (SS-A) and/or La (SS-B). Recent developments within autoimmune diagnostics allow quantitationof RF subclasses and anti-Ro epitopes. Will this refinement by autoimmunediagnostics help predicting development of extraglandular manifestations (EGM) inpS patients? A cohort of pS and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients withkeratoconjunctivitis sicca (n_=_35 and 16, resp) was included. Of the pSpatients, 54% developed one or more EGM. Antibodies quantitated were IgM-RF,IgA-RF, IgG-RF, anti-Ro52, and anti-Ro60. Upon analysis of RF isotypes, pSpatients generally displayed higher IgA-RF concentrations than RA patients (126versus 49ÊU/ml, p_=_0.015), while the dominant RF isotype in RA patients wasIgM-RF (82.5 versus 38ÊU/ml, p_=_0.012). No differences were observed regardingIgG-RF concentrations. In pS without/with EGM, the median RF IgM concentrationswere similar, while RF IgA and IgG concentrations tended to be lower in pSpatients with EGM_>_1. Both Ro epitopes were strongly recognized by almost all pSpatients, independent from EGM, while these antibodies were absent in RApatients. Primary Sjgren syndrome and RA patients have distinct serologicalprofiles when analysing RF and Ro-specific antibodies. A longitudinal study ofswitched RF isotypes in pS patients is worthwhile from an immunological point of view, but its value is limited regarding identification of pS patients prone todeveloping EGM or RA patients prone to developing secondary sicca symptoms.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Methotrexate and BAFF interaction prevents immunization against TNF inhibitors.,/pubmed/29936438,"OBJECTIVES: TNF inhibitors (TNFi) can induce anti-drug antibodies (ADA) inpatients with autoimmune diseases (AID) leading to clinical resistance. Weexplored a new way of using methotrexate (MTX) to decrease this risk ofimmunisation.METHODS: We treated BAFF transgenic (BAFFtg) mice, a model of AID in whichimmunisation against biologic drugs is high, with different TNFi. We investigatedthe effect of a single course of MTX during the first exposure to TNFi. Wild-type(WT) and BAFFtg mice were compared for B-Cell surface markers involved inMTX-related purinergic metabolism, adenosine production and regulatory B-cells(Bregs).We translated the study to macaques and patients with rheumatoidarthritis from the ABIRISK cohort to determine if there was an interactionbetween serum BAFF levels and MTX that prevented immuniation.RESULTS: In BAFFtg but not in WT mice or macaques, a single course of MTXprevented immunisation against TNFi and maintained drug concentration for over 52weeks. BAFFtg mice B-cells expressed more CD73 and CD39 compared to WT mice. MTX induced adenosine release from B cells and increased Bregs and precursors. Use ofCD73 blocking antibodies reversed MTX-induced tolerance. In patients from theABIRISK cohort treated with TNFi for chronic inflammatory diseases, high BAFFserum level correlated with absence of ADA to TNFi only in patients cotreatedwith MTX but not in patients on TNFi monotherapy.CONCLUSION: MTX and BAFF interact in mice where CD73, adenosine and regulatory B cells were identified as key actors in this phenomenon.

In vivo exposure to hydroquinone during the early phase of collagen-induced arthritis aggravates the disease.,/pubmed/29935983,"Robust correlation between the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) andcigarette smoking has been clinically demonstrated. Nevertheless, cigarettecompounds responsible for this toxic effect and their mechanisms have not beendescribed. Considering that hydroquinone (HQ) is an abundant, pro-oxidativecompound of the matter particle phase of cigarette smoke, we investigated whetherHQ exposure during the initial phase of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) couldaggravate the disease. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were exposed toaerosolized HQ (25_ppm), saline or 5% ethanol solution (HQ vehicle) for 1_h perday during 14 days. CIA was induced through s.c. injection of bovine collagenType II (0.4_mg/100__L) at days seven and 14 of exposure. Clinical signs ofdisease and the cell profile and chemical mediators in the synovial fluid andmembrane were analysed at day 35 after the beginning of exposure. HQ exposureaggravated CIA-related paw edema and increased the cell infiltrate andinterleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the synovial fluid, promoted intense tissuecollagen deposition and enhanced synoviocyte proliferation and higher frequencyof aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR+) and interleukin (IL-17+) neutrophils in thesynovial membrane. in vitro data also highlighted that neutrophils expressedincreased levels of AhR, IL-17 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.However, only AhR expression and ROS generation were blocked by in vitrotreatment with AhR antagonist. Therefore, we conclude that in vivo HQ exposure atthe early phase of AR onset worsens RA, leading to high frequency of AhR/IL-17+neutrophils into the joint.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Associations between D3R expression in synovial mast cells and disease activity and oxidant status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29934747,"Dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) on immune cells is involved in the pathogenesis ofrheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mast cells (MCs) are currently identified as importanteffector cells in synovial inflammation of RA, but little is known about the roleof D3R on synovial MCs in the pathogenesis of RA. Several inflammatory cells inthe synovium induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation which are involved inthe progression of RA. However, it is unclear whether D3R on synovial MCs isrelated to the levels of ROS in RA patients. In this study, a total of 73patients with RA were divided into three groups according to disease activityDAS28 scores. The number of cases in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 19, 26,and 28, respectively. We examined D3R-positive MC numbers in the synovial fluidand ROS levels in each group of RA patients, and we also analyzed the associationof D3R-positive MC numbers with RA disease activity and ROS levels. MDA andprotein carbonylation in the serum and synovial fluid were measured to reflectthe level of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, respectively.Additionally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the serum andsynovial fluid were used to be markers of antioxidant levels. Our results showed that D3R-positive MCs in the synovial fluid showed a declining trend with theincreased disease activity DAS28 score in RA patients. There was negativecorrelation between D3R-positive MC numbers in the synovial fluid and diseaseseverity DAS28 score of RA patients. Moreover, D3R-positive MC numbers in thesynovial fluid were negatively correlated with the level of MDA and proteincarbonylation while were positively correlated with antioxidant levels such asSOD and CAT in RA patients. Our results suggested that D3R on MCs may be involvedin ROS-mediated pathogenesis of RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We defined 6-month remission according toDisease Activity Score, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-erythrocytesedimentation rate, American College of Rheumatology/European League AgainstRheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Boolean criteria, Simplified Disease Activity Index,Clinical Disease Activity Index and two ultrasound definitions (no power Doppler signal, grey scale score ²2). Two outcomes were defined: no radiographicprogression and good outcome (no radiographicprogression+physical_function³general_population median), both sustained 12-24months. We calculated the ORs of these outcomes for the remission definitions.RESULTS: Of 103 patients, 42%-82% reached remission at 6 months, dependent ondefinition.

"Integrin, alpha9 subunit blockade suppresses collagen-induced arthritis with minimal systemic immunomodulation.",/pubmed/29932925,"Integrin, alpha9 subunit (hereinafter, alpha9) has been identified as a novelputative therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Support for thistarget comes from the observations that alpha9 is overexpressed both in thejoints of RA patients and in animal models of arthritis. In the experimentalmodels, the increase in alpha9 expression precedes the onset of arthriticsymptoms. The current study presents data on the pharmacological profile of ananti-alpha9 antibody in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.Administration of an alpha9-blocking antibody in CIA mice suppressed thedevelopment of arthritis and significantly decreased plasma level of activatedfibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS)-derived biomarkers without reducing theformation of anti-type II collagen antibodies. While anti-alpha9 antibodyadministration significantly suppress the accumulation of immune cells inarthritic joints it had no effect on immune cell number in the spleen.Furthermore, in non-arthritic mice, alpha9 had no inhibitory effect in either amixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) or in a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)reaction. These results suggest that blocking alpha9 exerts its anti-arthriticeffect through suppression of FLS-activation via a non-immune mediated mechanism.Finally, therapeutic administration of anti-alpha9 antibody alleviatedestablished arthritis in CIA mice. Our data provide evidence that alpha9 blockadeis a promising therapy for joint inflammation with minimal systemicimmunomodulation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Fibrin patch influences the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1ë± and nuclear factor-ë¼Bp65 factors on ischemic intestinal anastomosis.,/pubmed/29932372,"The intestinal anastomotic failure is one of the most severe complications ingastrointestinal surgery. Despite the great surgical improvements during the lastdecade, anastomotic leak rates remain practically the same, with a dramaticallyhigh grade of morbidity for patients. Leakages are usually the final consequence of ischemia in the anastomosis, leading to tissue hypoxia. In response tohypoxia, the cell orchestrates a variety of coordinated responses in order torestore oxygen homeostasis. The molecular mechanism of hypoxia sensitivityinvolves oxygen sensing hydroxylases, prolyl-hydroxylases, orchestrating two maintranscription factors related to induction of inßammation and angiogenesis,namely nuclear factor-_B and hypoxia-inducible factors. The immunohistochemicalexpression of two transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factors-1_ and nuclear factor-_B p65 has already been described in several disorders, including woundhealing, asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis,cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute colitis. In the surgical field,fibrin sealants have been widely used to prevent leaks in lung surgery and theymight also be useful as a reinforcement of sutures in intestinal anastomosis. Thecommercial fibrin sealant patches are hemostatic and adhesive surgical agentsmainly derived from human plasma. We herein report the results of a prospectiverandomized experimental study on pigs. We performed a high-risk leakage model of bowel anastomosis, causing a significant devascularization of 10-15 cm of thebowel wall before performing a conventional colo-ileal anastomosis. We randomizedthe animals to receive a covering of the anastomosis with a fibrin patch (casegroup) or not (control group). We report the changes in the immunohistochemicalexpression of the proteins involved in tissue response to hypoxia in theexperimental model. Our results indicate that the fibrin patch delays the healingresponse, promoting a longer lasting inflammation in the surgical bed.Nevertheless, the fibrin patches effectiveness to reduce dehiscence shown inclinical practice suggests that this delay does not negatively affect patients'outcome. Impact statement The consequences of the anastomotic failure aredramatic for patients. Understanding how the ever-increasing use of fibrinsealant, that seems to have a beneficial effect on the anastomoses, interactswith the tissue and the healing process can help to justify its use and encourageresearch on how to improve this effect even more. We feel that the present workshows that the patch can improve healing by complex mechanisms other than themere contention and physical support of the intestine. Furthermore, research isneeded to confirm our preliminary findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we elucidated the potential mechanisms by which FSTL1contributes to the pathogenesis of RA. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) wereestablished from synovial tissues of RA patients and stimulated with humanrecombinant FSTL1. Protein and mRNA expression levels of select matrixmetalloproteinases (i.e., MMP1, MMP3, MMP13) in FLS were measured by,respectively, real-time RT-qPCR and ELISA. Activation of MAPK and other pathways that affect MMPs were evaluated by Western blotting. We also comparedconcentrations of MMPs in plasma in RA patients versus healthy controls (HC).Expression levels of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 were clearly stimulated by FSTL1 invitro. FSTL1 activated the inflammation-related NF-_B signaling pathway, as well as all three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the JAK/STAT3pathway. Moreover, select chemical inhibitors that target p38 (SB203580), Erk1/2 (SP600125), JNK (SCH772984), STAT3 (AG490), and NF-_B (BAY 11-7082) significantlyattenuated MMP expression. Inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 by compound TAK-242significantly abolished those effects of FSTL1. Importantly, elevated plasmaconcentrations of MMP3 were found to correlate with plasma FSTL1 levels in RApatients. These findings suggest that FSTL1 accelerates RA progression byactivating MAPK, JAK/STAT3, and NF-_B pathways to enhance secretion of different MMPs and this enhancement is via TLR4. Targeting FSTL1 may provide a promisingpharmacological drug therapy to ameliorate RA symptoms and perhaps reversedisease progression.",N,,,,,,,,,,

In placebo-controlled trials, sarilumab improved the signs and symptoms of RA, as well as physicalfunction and health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL), when administered incombination with conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) therapy in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate or an inadequate response to, orintolerance of, at least one tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor; benefitswere sustained over_²_3Êyears' therapy in an open-label extension. Sarilumab plusmethotrexate inhibited the progression of structural damage in patients who hadinadequately responded to methotrexate. As monotherapy in patients who wereinappropriate for continued treatment with methotrexate, sarilumab was moreeffective than adalimumab in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA and improving physical function. The safety profile of sarilumab was consistent with theanticipated effects of IL-6 inhibition. In the minority of patients who testedpositive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), ADAs did not impact efficacy orincrease adverse reactions. Thus, sarilumab extends the available treatmentoptions for adults with moderately to severely active RA who have respondedinadequately to, or are intolerant of, at least one DMARD.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Synovial fluid uric acid level aids diagnosis of gout.,/pubmed/29930806,"Examination of urate crystal in synovial fluid (SF) remains the gold standard fordiagnosis of gout, but is not universally available. SF uric acid (UA) level may be measured by the uricase method with an automated analyzer. The present studyaimed to evaluate the utility of SF to serum UA ratio (SSR) for diagnosis ofgout. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Center for Rheumatic Diseases, Nepal. Patients presenting with acute (<1 day) joint pain and/orswelling were included. Aspiration was performed in all patients and fluid wassubjected to testing for urate level, pH and cell counts and microscopy. Serumsamples were also assessed for urate levels, and the SSR was calculated for each patient. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine thecutoff value for indicating diagnosis of gout. The difference in SSR between goutand non-gout effusion was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. A total of181 patients were included of which 77 had gout. The remaining cases includedosteoarthritis, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. SSR was significantly higher in gout patients than in any other group (P<0.05). AnSSR of ³1.01 had the highest sensitivity and specificity at 89.6 and 66.3%,respectively, for identifying gout effusion. The present results indicated thatSSR may be used as an aid for gout diagnosis when polarizing microscopy is notavailable.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Stevens-Johnsons syndrome or drug-induced lupus - a clinical dilemma: A case report and review of the literature.,/pubmed/29930803,"Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are the first biological agents used in thetreatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to have yielded satisfactory results interms of clinical improvement and radiologic progression, but they are alsoassociated with the possibility of occurrence of a number of autoimmune systemic events [drug-induced lupus (DIL), vasculitis, sarcoidosis] and localized adverse events [uveitis, psoriasis, interstitial lung disease, erythema multiformeincluding the major form Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)]. During treatment withTNF inhibitors, many patients develop positivity for antinuclear, antihistone andanti-double stranded DNA antibodies, though only a minority of patients willdevelop clinical manifestations and approximately less than 1% will fulfill theclassification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. Mucocutaneousmanifestations are the most frequent manifestations of DIL following treatmentwith TNF inhibitors, and can be severe and occasionally difficult todifferentiate from erythema multiforme/SJS. Stopping the causative drug (the TNF inhibitor) and general supportive measures are usually sufficient in mild forms, but in moderate to severe forms, systemic glucocorticoids and sometimesimmunosuppressive drugs are required. The present report presents the case of apatient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed severe recurrent cutaneousreactions and positive autoantibodies during TNF inhibitor treatment, withdifficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment.

The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in rheumatic diseases.,/pubmed/29930301,"Rheumatic diseases are a collection of disorders defined by the presence ofinflammation and destruction of joints and internal organs. A common feature ofthese diseases is the presence of autoantibodies targeting molecules commonlyexpressed in neutrophils. These preformed mediators are released by neutrophilsbut not by other immune cells such as macrophages. Neutrophils, major players in the host innate immune response, initiate a cell death mechanism termedneutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a way to ensnare pathogens. NETsare also a source of released self-molecules found in rheumatic diseases.Subsequently, research on the role of NETs in the onset, progression andresolution of inflammation in rheumatic diseases has intensified. This Review hastwo aims. First, it aims to highlight the mechanisms required for the generation of NETs, the research landscape of which is rapidly changing. Second, it aims to discuss the role of neutrophils and NETs in systemic lupus erythematosus,vasculitis (specifically anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associatedvasculitis), rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Our goal is to clarify the field ofNET research in rheumatic diseases in the hope of improving the therapeuticapproaches utilized for these diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Obliterative bronchiolitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis: analysis of a single-center case series.,/pubmed/29929518,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune conditioncharacterized by erosive inflammation of the joints. One rare pulmonarymanifestation is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), a small airways diseasecharacterized by the destruction of bronchiolar epithelium and airflowobstruction.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients withrheumatoid arthritis-associated obliterative bronchiolitis (RA-OB) from01/01/2000 to 12/31/2015. Presenting clinical features, longitudinal pulmonaryfunction testing, radiologic findings, and independent predictors of all-causemortality were assessed.RESULTS: Forty one patients fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of RA-OB. There was notable female predominance (92.7%) with a mean age of 57_±_15Êyears. Dyspnea wasthe most common presenting clinical symptom. Median FEV1 was 40% (IQR 31-52.5) atpresentation, with a mean decline of -_1.5% over a follow-up period ofthirty-three months. Associated radiologic findings included mosaic attenuationand pulmonary nodules. A majority of patients (78%) received directed therapyincluding long-acting inhalers, systemic corticosteroids or otherimmunosuppressive agents, and macrolide antibiotics. All-cause mortality was 27% over a median follow-up of sixty-two months (IQR 32-113). No distinguishablepredictors of survival at presentation were found.CONCLUSIONS: RA-OB appears to have a stable clinical course in the majority ofpatients despite persistent symptoms and severe obstruction based on presentingFEV1.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of magnetic nanoparticles size on rheumatoid arthritis targeting and photothermal therapy.,/pubmed/29929166,"Nanoparticles based multifunctional system exhibits great potential in diagnosis and therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The size of nanoparticles plays anessential role in biodistribution and cellular uptake, in turn affects the drugdelivery efficiency and therapeutic effect. To investigate the optimal size forRA targeting, Fe3O4 nanoparticles with well-defined particle sizes (70-350_nm)and identical surface properties were developed as model nanoparticles. Thesynthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited excellent biocompatibility and showedhigher temperature response under irradiation of near infrared light.Size-dependent internalization was observed when incubated with inflammatorycells. Compared with large ones, small nanoparticles were more readily bephagocytized, leading to higher cytotoxicity in vitro. However, the in vivoexperiment in CIA mice demonstrated a quite different result that nanoparticleswith size of 220 nm exerted better accessibility to inflamed joint and resultedin higher temperature and better therapeutic effect under laser irradiation. Thisstudy not only offered a novel method for RA therapy but also a guideline for RA targeted drug carrier design.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Psychiatric comorbidity increases mortality in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.,/pubmed/29929117,"OBJECTIVE: We determined the association between any common mental disorder (CMD:depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder) and mortality and suicide inthree immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), versus age-, sex-and geographically-matched controls.METHODS: Using administrative data, we identified 28,384 IMID cases (IBD: 8695;MS: 5496; RA: 14,503) and 141,672 matched controls. We determined annual rates ofmortality, suicide and suicide attempts. We evaluated the association of any CMD with all-cause mortality and suicide using multivariable Cox regression models.RESULTS: In the IMID cohort, any CMD was associated with increased mortality. We observed a greater than additive interaction between depression and IMID status(attributable proportion 5.2%), but a less than additive interaction with anxiety(attributable proportion -13%). Findings were similar for MS and RA. In IBD, aless than additive interaction existed with depression and anxiety on mortalityrisk. The IMID cohort with any CMD had an increased suicide risk versus thematched cohort without CMD.CONCLUSION: CMD are associated with increased mortality and suicide risk in IMID.In MS and RA, the effects of depression on mortality risk are greater thanassociations of these IMID and depression alone.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Dual-functional lipid polymeric hybrid pH-responsive nanoparticles decorated with cell penetrating peptide and folate for therapy against rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29928978,"Methotrexate (MTX), as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), was first line drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, the severe side effect duringlong term and high dosage usage limit its application. The aim of this study was to develop dual-functional lipid polymeric hybrid pH-responsive nanoparticles to deliver MTX to inflamed joints selectively. The designed MTX loaded stearicacid-octa-arginine and folic acid decorated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-PK3-based lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles (Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/MTX) werecomposed of PK3, Folate-PEG-PLGA, egg PC, and Sta-R8. The nanoparticles exhibitedsmooth spherical morphology and particle size of 100_150 nm. The in vitro releasestudy indicated that MTX was released faster in phosphate buffered solution (PBS)of pH 5.0 than that in PBS of pH 7.4 from Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/MTX. The cellularuptake study revealed that Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/MTX were internalized through folate receptor mediated endocytosis into activated macrophages. Therapeutic effects on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats further confirm that Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/MTXcould be promising against rheumatoid arthritis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sialylated Autoantigen-Reactive IgG Antibodies Attenuate Disease Development in Autoimmune Mouse Models of Lupus Nephritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis.,/pubmed/29928274,"Pro- and anti-inflammatory effector functions of IgG antibodies (Abs) depend ontheir subclass and Fc glycosylation pattern. Accumulation of non-galactosylated(agalactosylated; G0) IgG Abs in the serum of rheumatoid arthritis and systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE) patients reflects severity of the diseases. Incontrast, sialylated IgG Abs are responsible for anti-inflammatory effects of theintravenous immunoglobulin (pooled human serum IgG from healthy donors),administered in high doses (2_g/kg) to treat autoimmune patients. However,whether low amounts of sialylated autoantigen-reactive IgG Abs can also inhibitautoimmune diseases is hardly investigated. Here, we explore whether sialylatedautoantigen-reactive IgG Abs can inhibit autoimmune pathology in different mouse models. We found that sialylated IgG auto-Abs fail to induce inflammation andlupus nephritis in a B cell receptor (BCR) transgenic lupus model, but insteadare associated with lower frequencies of pathogenic Th1, Th17 and B cellresponses. In accordance, the transfer of small amounts of immune complexescontaining sialylated IgG Abs was sufficient to attenuate the development ofnephritis. We further showed that administration of sialylated collagen type II(Col II)-specific IgG Abs attenuated the disease symptoms in a model of ColII-induced arthritis and reduced pathogenic Th17_cell and autoantigen-specificIgG Ab responses. We conclude that sialylated autoantigen-specific IgG Abs mayrepresent a promising tool for treating pathogenic T and B cell immune responses in autoimmune diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of Serological Biomarkers in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Their Combination to Improve Diagnostic Performance.,/pubmed/29928272,"Introduction: The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is based on a combinedapproach that includes serological markers such as rheumatoid factor (RF) andanti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA). The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of several RF and ACPA immunoassays for the diagnosis of RA, as well as the diagnostic value of a combinatory approach withthese markers.Methods: The study cohort included 1,655 patients from the Swiss Clinical QualityManagement registry with sera from 968 patients with RA and 687 disease controls,including patients with axial spondyloarthritis (n_=_450) and psoriatic arthritis(n_=_237). ACPA were determined by anti-CCP2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA), QUANTA Flash¨ CCP3 IgG [chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA)], andQUANTA Lite¨ CCP3 IgG ELISA. RF was determined by ELISA (QUANTA Lite¨ RF IgM, RF IgA, and RF IgG) and with two research use only CIAs (QUANTA Flash¨ RF IgM and RFIgA).Results: All three ACPA assays showed good discrimination between RA patients andcontrols and good clinical performance. Overall, CCP3 performed better than CCP2.More pronounced differences were observed between the RF assays. We observed thatCIA platforms for both RF IgM and RF IgA showed better performance than the ELISAplatforms. Excellent and good total agreements were found between ELISA and CIAfor CCP3 (total agreement 95.3%, kappa_=_0.90), and between CCP2 and CCP3 ELISA(total agreement 86.6%, kappa_=_0.73), respectively. RF IgM CIA and ELISA had agood qualitative agreement (86.5%, kappa_=_0.73); RF IgA CIA and ELISA showed amoderate total agreement (78.5%, kappa_=_0.53). When combinatory analyses wereperformed, the likelihood of RA increased with dual positivity and triplepositivity and combining different markers resulted in higher odds ratio than theindividual markers in all cases.Conclusion: ACPA and RF showed good clinical performance in this large Swisscohort of RA patients and controls. Overall, the performance of CCP3 was superiorto CCP2. The combination of these biomarkers in an interval model represents apotential tool for the diagnosis of RA patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A cytokine protein-protein interaction network for identifying key molecules in rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29928007,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the synovialjoints. Though the current RA therapeutics such as disease-modifyingantirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) andbiologics can halt the progression of the disease, none of these would eitherdramatically reduce or cure RA. So, the identification of potential therapeutictargets and new therapies for RA are active areas of research. Several studieshave discovered the involvement of cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease.These cytokines induce signal transduction pathways in RA synovial fibroblasts(RASF). These pathways share many signal transducers and their interactingproteins, resulting in the formation of a signaling network. In order tounderstand the involvement of this network in RA pathogenesis, it is essential toidentify the key transducers and their interacting proteins that are part of thisnetwork. In this study, based on a detailed literature survey, we have identifieda list of 12 cytokines that induce signal transduction pathways in RASF. Forthese cytokines, we have built a signaling network using the protein-proteininteraction (PPI) data that was obtained from public repositories such as HPRD,BioGRID, MINT, IntAct and STRING. By combining the network centrality measureswith the gene expression data from the RA related microarrays that are available in the open source Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we have identified 24 key proteins of this signaling network. Two of these 24 are already drug targets for RA, and of the remaining, 12 have direct PPI links to some of the currentdrug targets of RA. Therefore, these key proteins seem to be crucial in thepathogenesis of RA and hence might be treated as potential drug targets.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Acetyl-11-Keto-ë_-Boswellic Acid Promotes Osteoblast Differentiation by Inhibiting Tumor Necrosis Factor-ë± and Nuclear Factor-ë¼B Activity.,/pubmed/29927820,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -_ plays a crucial role in rheumatoid arthritis(RA)-related bone loss disease. The main mechanism of action of RA induced boneloss is the significant inhibitory effect of TNF-_ on osteoblast differentiation.TNF-_ inhibits osteoblast differentiation mainly by activating nuclear factor(NF) -_B signaling pathway. Owing to the crucial role of TNF-_ and NF-_B in theinhibition of osteoblast differentiation, they are considered as targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the NF-_Binhibitor Boswellic acid (BA) and its derivatives in the regulation of osteoblastdifferentiation and the molecular mechanism. Based on the cell model of TNF-_induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1, the regulatory roleof BAs was studied. The result of MTT assay indicated that bone morphogeneticprotein (BMP) -2, TNF-_, or acetyl-11-keto-_-BA (AKBA) impact no significanteffect for cell viability of MC3T3-E1. The results of alkaline phosphatase (ALPactivity assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that AKBAblocked TNF-_-induced inhibition of the expression of osteoblast markers,suggesting that AKBA rescued osteoblast differentiation from TNF-_-inducedinhibition. Additionally, AKBA stimulated the BMP-2-induced expression ofosteoblast markers, suggesting that AKBA promotes osteoblast differentiationdirectly. The results of western blotting and luciferase assay indicated thatN-_B signaling was activated by TNF-_. The overexpression of NF-_B component p65 in MC3T3-E1 was found to attenuate the positive effect of AKBA in osteoblastdifferentiation, suggesting that AKBA potentiates osteoblast differentiation byinhibiting NF-_B signaling. Collectively, AKBA promotes osteoblastdifferentiation by inhibiting TNF-_ and NF-_B. Our study revealed a new discoveryof AKBA in regulating osteoblast differentiation, and demonstrated that AKBA may be a potential anabolic agent in the treatment of RA-derived bone loss disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Case series: rheumatological manifestations attributed to exposure to Libby Asbestiform Amphiboles.,/pubmed/29927712,"An increased risk for Systemic Autoimmune Diseases (SAID) has been reported inLibby, Montana, where extensive exposures to fibrous amphiboles occurred due tomining and use of asbestos-laden vermiculite. In addition, positive antinuclearautoantibody tests are associated with exposure to Libby Asbestiform Amphiboles(LAA) in both humans and mice. Among 6603 subjects who underwent health screeningat the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases (CARD, Libby MT), 13.8% werediagnosed with an autoimmune disease, with prevalence values for the most common SAID being significantly higher than expected in the United States. Among theCARD screening population, serological and clinical profiles are diverse,representing symptoms and autoantibodies reflective of systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumaticsyndromes, including undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). Basedupon screening of medical records by physicians with rheumatology expertise, the evolving nature of rheumatological disease in these patients is often atypical,with mixed diagnostic criteria and with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio. Through theLibby Epidemiology Research Program, cases were identified that illustrateclinical autoimmune outcomes with LAA exposure. Our goal was to bettercharacterize SAID in Libby, MT in order to improve recognition of autoimmuneoutcomes associated with this exposure. In view of recent discoveries ofwidespread exposure to fibrous minerals in several areas of the U.S. andglobally, it is critical to evaluate rheumatologic manifestations in othercohorts so that screening, surveillance, and diagnostic procedures are able todetect and recognize potential autoimmune outcomes of asbestosexposure.ABBREVIATIONS: ANA, antinuclear autoantibody; ARD, Asbestos-RelatedDiseases; ATSDR, Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry; CARD, Center forAsbestos Related Diseases; CCP, Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; CREST,limited cutaneous form of scleroderma; CT, computed tomography; DIP, DistalInterphalangeal Joint; DLCO, Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for CO2; DMARD,Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs; ENA, Extractable Nuclear Antigenantibodies; FVC, Forced Vital Capacity; LAA, Libby Asbestiform Amphiboles; LERP, Libby Epidemiology Research Program; MCP, Metacarpal Phalangeal Joint; PIP,Proximal Interphalangeal Joint; PIP, rheumatoid arthritis; RV, Residual Volume;SAID, Systemic autoimmune diseases; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SSc,Systemic Sclerosis; TLC, Total Lung Capacity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Pathogenic citrulline-multispecific B cell receptor clades in rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29927106,"OBJECTIVE: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) have proven highly usefulas biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the composition andfunctionality of the associated autoreactive B cell repertoire have not beendirectly assessed. We aimed to selectively investigate citrullinatedautoantigen-specific B cell receptors (BCRs) involved in RA and initiate studies on their pathogenicity.METHODS: A University of Minnesota ACPA+ RA cohort (n = 89 subjects) providedblood samples. Tetramer sets bearing citrullinated filaggrin peptide CFC1 orcitrullinated _-enolase peptide CEP-1 were constructed to specifically captureautoreactive B cells from the unaltered, polyclonal repertoire of RA patients.Citrullinated peptide tetramer-bound B cells were subjected to flow cytometriccell sorting and single-cell IGH, IGK, and IGL gene sequencing for B cell lineagedeterminations. BCR gene sequences were also expressed as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for direct evaluation of citrullinated autoantigen binding and effector functionality.RESULTS: Using citrullinated peptide tetramer-enrichment to investigate singleautoreactive blood B cells, we identified biased V-region gene usage andconserved junction arrangements in RA subject BCRs. Parsimonious clustering ofrelated immunoglobulin gene nucleotide sequences revealed clonal expansions ofrare individual B cell clades in parallel with divergent sequence mutations.Correspondingly, recombinant mAbs generated from such BCR lineages demonstratedcitrulline-dependent cross-reactivity extending beyond the citrullinated peptidesused for B cell capture. A pair of citrullinated autoantigen-specific mAbs withcross-reactive binding profiles also promoted arthritis in mice.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that broad ACPA specificities in RA arise from arestricted repertoire of evolving citrulline-multispecific B cell clades withpathogenic potential.

Affinity Maturation Drives Epitope Spreading and Generation of Pro-inflammatory Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,/pubmed/29927104,"OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by anti-citrullinatedprotein antibodies (ACPAs), nevertheless, the origin, specificity, and functionalproperties of ACPAs remain poorly understood. To characterize the evolution ofACPAs, we sequenced the plasmablast antibody repertoire at serial timepoints insubjects with established RA.METHODS: Blood samples were obtained at up to four timepoints from eightanti-CCP+ individuals with established RA. We single-cell sortedCD19+CD3-IgD-CD14-CD20-CD27+CD38++ plasmablasts and co-stained withcitrullinated-peptide tetramers to identify ACPA-expressing plasmablasts.Cell-specific oligonucleotide barcodes were utilized followed by large-scalesequencing and bioinformatic analysis to obtain error-corrected, paired, heavyand light chain antibody gene sequences for each B cell.RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis revealed 170 persistent plasmablast lineages ofwhich 19% included multiple isotypes. Among IgG- and IgA-expressing plasmablasts,we observed significantly more IgA-expressing persistent lineages compared to IgG(P < 0.01). We identified shared CDR3 sequence motifs across subjects. A subsetof lineages comprised of later-timepoint derived members with divergent somatichypermutations encoded antibodies that bind an expanded set of citrullinatedantigens. Further, these recombinant, differentially mutated plasmablastantibodies formed immune complexes that stimulated higher levels of macrophageTNF-_ production compared to antibodies representing earlier-timepoint,less-mutated lineage members.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that established RA is characterized by apersistent IgA ACPA response that exhibits ongoing affinity maturation. Thisobservation suggests the presence of a persistent mucosal antigen thatcontinually promotes the production of IgA plasmablasts, and their affinitymaturation and epitope spreading to generate ACPAs that bind additionalcitrullinated antigens and more potently stimulate macrophage TNF-_ production.This article is protected by copyright.

"Effect of tildrakizumab (MK-3222), a high affinity, selective anti-IL23p19 monoclonal antibody, on cytochrome P450 metabolism in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis.",/pubmed/29926968,"AIMS: Tildrakizumab, an interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor, is indicated for thetreatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Although tildrakizumab is not metabolized by, and does not alter, cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression invitro, clinically-significant pharmacokinetic effects through changes in systemicinflammation, which alters CYP metabolism, have been well documented. At the timeof study conduct, the effect of modulation of inflammation/cytokines, includingIL-23 inhibition with tildrakizumab, on CYP metabolism, and therefore thepotential for disease-drug interactions, in psoriasis patients was unknown. Wetherefore assessed whether tildrakizumab alters CYP metabolism in subjects withmoderate to severe psoriasis.METHODS: This was an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period trial. In Period 1(Day 1), subjects received an oral CYP probe cocktail of up to five drugs(midazolam 2 mg [3A4], caffeine 200 mg [1A2], warfarin 10 mg [2C9], omeprazole 40mg [2C19] and dextromethorphan 30 mg [2D6]), followed by a 7-day washout. InPeriod 2, subjects received tildrakizumab 200 mg subcutaneously on Days 1 and 29 and a second CYP probe cocktail on Day 57. Substrate or metabolitepharmacokinetics, safety, and changes in Psoriasis Severity Area Index (PASI),interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), wereassessed.RESULTS: Twenty subjects (13 men, 7 women) were enrolled. Tildrakizumab had noclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of any of the probe substratestested. On Day 57 of Period 2, the median percent decrease from baseline in PASI score following tildrakizumab was ~93%. There were no clinically relevant changesin IL-6 or hs-CRP. Treatment with tildrakizumab was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSION: In subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, tildrakizumab 200 mgdid not have a discernible effect on CYP metabolism. The potential for clinicallysignificant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with tildrakizumab in patients withpsoriasis is low. The difference in the occurrence of DDIs seen withanti-inflammatory agents in rheumatoid arthritis patients compared with psoriasispatients may be due to the much greater extent of systemic inflammation inrheumatoid arthritis as compared to psoriasis.",Single arm,Y,,,,,,,,,
Metabolomic Analysis of Biochemical Changes in the Serum and Urine of Freund's Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Rats after Treatment with Silkworm Excrement.,/pubmed/29925785,"Silkworm excrement (SE), is used as a traditional antirheumatic medicine inChina. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of water fraction of SE (ST) and ethanol fraction of SE (CT) at two different doses on adjuvant induced arthritis (AA) rats. Arthritis severity was evaluated by bodyweight, paw thickness, histological changes and index of paws oedema and spleen. Serum samples were collected for estimation of biochemical indicators andcytokines. In addition, a metabonomic method based on the ultra-performanceliquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) had been established to investigate the holistic efficacy of SEby serum and urine. Multivariate statistical approaches, such as partialleast-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were built to evaluate thetherapeutic effects of SE and find potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways.Administration with SE significantly ameliorated the AA severity, including body weight loss, paw swelling, histological changes and the levels of biochemicalindex. 33 endogenous metabolites had been identified (10 in serum and 23 inurine) in the AA rats. Urinary and serum metabolic profiling revealed that themetabolites underpin the metabolic pathway including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; pentose and glucuronate interconversions; TCA cycle; beta-Alaninemetabolism; purine metabolism and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. The alteredmetabolites could be regulated closer to normal level after SE intervention. The results suggested SE possesses substantial anti-arthritic activity anddemonstrated that metabonomics is a powerful tool to gain insight in themechanism of SE formula in therapy.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder complicated by severe acute respiratory failure and ileal perforation: a case report.,/pubmed/29925726,"Lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) is a potentially severe adverse effect ofmethotrexate (MTX) administration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report a case of MTX-associated LPD (MTX-LPD) in a patient with RA who developed severe pulmonary failure complicated by perforation of the terminal ileum. A61-year-old woman with RA receiving MTX complained of dyspnea and abdominal pain.She was diagnosed with intestinal perforation and peritonitis, and underwentimmediate abdominal surgery. Pathological examinations of the specimen obtainedfrom the resected ileum and a bone marrow aspirate revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Steroid therapy failed to improve her respiratory failure, but hercondition improved after abdominal surgery and suspension of MTX. MTX-LPD canresult in multiple life-threatening conditions; however, the symptoms are highly variable.

The purpose of this study was to determine if ahistory of autoimmune diseases (AD) is associated with an increased risk of lateronset of schizophrenia.METHODS: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was used toidentify a total of 64,817 AD patients and an equal number of age-matched controlpatients. The incidence rates of schizophrenia with a maximum follow-up period of10_years between patients with and without AD were compared using a Coxproportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidenceinterval (95% CI).RESULTS: The main finding was the discovery of a higher incidence of subsequentschizophrenia in patients with AD (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.23-2.4) after adjustmentfor other demographic characteristics. Specifically, the risk of schizophreniawas observed to be a significant increase in systemic lupus erythematosus (3.73, 2.07-6.72), rheumatoid arthritis (2.89, 1.97-4.23), dermatomyositis (5.85,1.32-25.94) and autoimmune vasculitis (2.44, 1.17-5.06). Also, this studyrevealed some potential risk factors for developing schizophrenia, includingyounger age (less than or equal to 50_years) and some comorbidities(hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and alcohol use disorder). Conversely, this study found that steroid use was a potential protective factorfor the development of schizophrenia.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that AD were associated with an increased risk ofdeveloping schizophrenia, suggesting that the abnormal autoimmune process wasassociated with an increase in the expression of psychiatric disturbances.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Sirukumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: update on sirukumab, 2018.",/pubmed/29925278,"INTRODUCTION: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is well-known for its pro-inflammatoryproperties, has been proven to target a wide range of cells in the joint and has been implicated in extra-articular and articular manifestations in rheumatoidarthritis (RA). Tocilizumab (TCZ) is now widely used in patients with active RAand a number of additional agents that target the IL-6 pathways are underdevelopment, including sirukumab (SRK). Areas covered: SRK is a IgG1_ humananti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody which binds to IL-6 and prevents IL-6 mediateddownstream effects. Initial trial results in phase III studies in patients withRA seemed promising, showing improved results in patients with moderate to severeRA. Data derive from the phase II study and the various SIRROUND studies (phaseIII). Expert commentary: The available data show that SRK50 mg every 4 weeks or100 mg every 2 weeks will be effective in treating the RA population, withclinical improvements as early as week 2 and sustained over time. The adverseevent profile seems to be similar to TCZ, except for an increased mortality post open-label studies due to infections and cardiovascular events, our knowledge of which will be deepened with post-marketing surveillance and registry data.",N,,,,,,,,,,
[The efficacy of immunoadsorption with Infliximab theraepy on the modulation of disease activity in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis].,/pubmed/29925168,"Objective: To evaluated the efficacy of additional immunoadsorption therapy (2times) besides infliximab (IFX) ondisease remission in patients with severerheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: 90 patients with serve RA were included inthis study.There were 43 patients in the control group who were treated with IFX 3 mg/kg+ methotrexate (MTX) therapy, and other 47 patients were experimentalgroup, who were previous given 2 times additional immunoadsorption therapy beforeIFX 3 mg/kg+ MTX therapy.IFX 3 mg/kg was infused at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22 and30.Age, sex ration, mean disease duration and core index of disease activity intwo treatment groups were collected at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 30 weeks to compare the efficacy and safety of combined immunosorbent therapy in the treatment of severe RA. Results: The baseline age, sex ration and core indexes of disease activitywere comparable between the two treatment groups (P>0.05). After treatment, thecore indexes of disease activity of all patients decreased significantly comparedwith their baseline levels (P<0.05) and the difference of sustainable maintenanceto 30 weeks (P<0.05). After 2 and 6 weeks of treatment, patients' ACR20 remissionrates of the experimental group were 46.81% and 68.08%, significantly higher thanthe control group; after 30 weeks of treatment, patients' ACR20 remission ratesof the experimental group was more than 90%, while the number was 79.07% in thecontrol group.At the same time DAS28-ESR clinical remission and low diseaseactivity also reached 72.34% in the experimental group, higher than the controlgroup(P<0.05).

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4: a nuclear button triggering neutrophil extracellular traps in inflammatory diseases and aging.,/pubmed/29924943,"Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is a nuclear citrullinating enzyme that iscritically involved in the release of decondensed chromatin from neutrophils asneutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs, together with fibrin, are implicatedin host defense against pathogens; however, the formation of NETs (NETosis) hasinjurious effects that may outweigh their protective role. For example, PAD4activity produces citrullinated neoantigens that promote autoimmune diseases,such as rheumatoid arthritis, to which PAD4 is genetically linked and whereNETosis is prominent. NETs are also generated in basic sterile inflammatoryresponses that are induced by many inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines,hypoxia, and activated platelets. Mice that lack PAD4-deficient in NETosis-serve as an excellent tool with which to study the importance of NETs in diseasemodels. In recent years, animal and human studies have demonstrated that NETscontribute to the etiology and propagation of many common noninfectious diseases,the focus of our review. We will discuss the role of NETs in thrombotic andcardiovascular disease, the induction of NETs by cancers and its implications forcancer progression and cancer-associated thrombosis, and elevated NETosis indiabetes and its negative impact on wound healing, and will propose a linkbetween PAD4/NETs and age-related organ fibrosis.

Glucocorticoid exposure and fracture risk in a cohort of US patients with selected conditions.,/pubmed/29924418,"PURPOSE: We evaluated systemic glucocorticoid exposure and fracture amongpatients with newly-diagnosed inflammatory and immune-modulated conditions.METHODS: Using administrative data, inception cohorts of RA, asthma/COPD, IBD,MS, lupus, and sarcoidosis patients age 18-64 years with benefits coverage ³12months before diagnosis (1/1/2005-12/31/2012) were followed to clinical fracture,cancer diagnosis, or 12/31/2012. Glucocorticoid users were new to therapy.Fracture incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were stratified byprednisone equivalent doses. Cox's proportional hazards models assessed risk bydaily and cumulative dose, and by time since discontinuation, adjusted forbaseline characteristics.RESULTS: Most patients (72% of 403,337) had glucocorticoid exposure; 52% wereunder age 50. IR (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of any osteoporotic fracture waselevated at doses_<_5_mg/day, IR: 9.33 [7.29, 11.77] versus 0_mg/day, IR: 4.87[4.72, 5.02]). Fracture rates were elevated at doses_<_5_mg/day in patients_<_50 years and those ³ 50 years. In both age groups, fracture risk increased withincreasing cumulative exposure, being approximately 2.5-fold higher at cumulativedose ³ 5400_mg compared to_<_675_mg. At ³ 5400_mg, IR were 5.69 [4.32, 7.35] inpatients_<_50 years and 17.10 [14.97, 19.46] in older patients.

Usefulness of tocilizumab for treating rheumatoid arthritis with myelodysplastic syndrome: A case report and literature review.,/pubmed/29924032,"RATIONALE: Dysregulated immune function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might leadto the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations are increased in both RA and MDS patients.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old woman presented with severe RA. During a recent8-month period, the patient experienced swelling in multiple joints, dizziness,and severe anemia. The symptoms responded poorly to oral corticosteroids andmethotrexate (MTX). Even treatment of the patient's anemia by transfusion of red blood cells was ineffective. Laboratory tests showed high levels of IL-6(214.24_pg/mL).DIAGNOSES: Combining her medical history with clinical and laboratory parameters,especially those obtained by bone marrow aspiration, a diagnosis of RA with MDSwas made.INTERVENTIONS: MTX was discontinued and the patient was given tocilizumabintravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks and oral corticosteroids(15_mg/QD).OUTCOMES: The patient's serological, physical, and pathological abnormalitiesimproved significantly.LESSONS: We report a case of RA with MDS successfully treated with tocilizumab.To our knowledge, this is the first case of an RA patient with MDS that wassuccessfully treated with tocilizumab. In addition, our case emphasizes that IL-6plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA with MDS. Tocilizumab might be aneffective treatment for RA with MDS, especially in those with high levels ofIL-6, elevated C-reactive protein, and severe anemia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predictability of severity of disc degeneration and disc protrusion using horizontal displacement of cervical dynamic radiographs: A retrospective comparison study with MRI.,/pubmed/29924003,"The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of flexion-extension(dynamic) radiographs in evaluating the severity of disc degeneration and discprotrusion in cervical magnetic resonance image (MRI). Patients complaining ofneck or arm pain with no prior surgical history and who had undergone bothcervical MRI and dynamic radiographs were included in this study. The followingpatients were excluded: those who had any history of trauma, autoimmune diseasesuch as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, prior cervical fractureor prior cervical spine surgery. Based on these criteria, 161 patients whovisited our department for neck pain or upper extremity radicular symptoms wereinitially included retrospectively. Among them, 69 patients were excluded due to the lack of cervical MRI or dynamic radiographs. Therefore, a total of 92patients were included for analysis in this study. The maximal diameter of discprotrusion in sagittal or axial MRI, the severity of cervical disc degeneration, and segmental horizontal displacement in dynamic cervical radiographs are themain outcome measurements. In the results of this study, the extension radiographof C5/6 had the highest sensitivity (93.33%) and specificity (100%) in predictingcervical disc protrusion followed by C4/5 (sensitivity; 77.28%, specificity92.86%) among the dynamic radiographs. Segmental horizontal displacement at theC3/4, C4/5, and C5/6 level in the neutral and extension radiographs had asignificant correlation with the severity of cervical disc degeneration in MRI(P_<_.05). At the C6/7 level, however, only extension radiograph had asignificant correlation with the severity of cervical disc degeneration in theMRI (P_<_.05). In conclusion, if MRI is not available in a primary clinicalsetting, dynamic cervical radiographs may be useful in predicting the severity ofdegenerative disc and disc protrusion in cervical MRI. Among the dynamic cervicalradiographs, the extension radiograph was the most sensitive for predicting theseverity of cervical disc degeneration and disc protrusion, especially at theC3/4, C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7 levels in MRI.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effectiveness of foot orthoses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis related to disability and pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29922913,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies consistently report a 90% prevalence of foot pain. Mechanical and other non-pharmacological interventions such as orthoses andfootwear can play an important role in managing foot pathology in patients whose systemic disease is controlled. The effectiveness of treatment with insoles hasbeen examined in various randomised controlled trials, which have reportedimmediate clinical improvements, with reduced foot pain and disability andenhanced functionality. The aim of this systematic review is to determine theeffectiveness of foot orthoses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), incomparison with other treatments, in terms of enhanced disability and reducedpain.METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of a number ofrandomised controlled trials focusing on patients with RA. The search wasconducted in Cochrane, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Cuiden, by means of an independent peer review. The Mesh terms and fields used were foot, ankle, joint, RA, foot, orthosis, insole and foot orthosis.RESULTS: Of the initial 118 studies considered, 5 were included in the finalsystematic review and meta-analysis. These five studies had enrolled a total of301 participants, with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 36Êmonths. Althoughthe use of orthoses seems to alleviate foot pain, our meta-analysis did notreveal statistically significant differences between control and interventiongroups regarding long- and short-term pain relief and/or reduced disability.CONCLUSIONS: Foot orthoses can relieve pain and disability and enhance patients, but no significant differences were found between control and interventiongroups.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Wrist Arthroscopy in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: A Review of Current Literature and Future Implications.,/pubmed/29922493,"Introduction _Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most commonrheumatological condition in children and frequently affects the wrist.

Methods _Systematicliterature review of relevant publications from 1990 to present in the CochraneLibrary, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, DynaMed, PEMSoft, NICE Guidance, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. Results _We found no publications detailing the use ofarthroscopy or AS specifically in patients with JIA involving the wrist. There isevidence that AS reduces pain, improves function, and induces remission inpatients with rheumatoid arthritis resistant to medical management. Discussionand Conclusion _Although there is paucity in evidence for the use of AS in thewrists of patients with JIA, studies suggest it to be safe and effective, andcould be applied to patients with refractive JIA. It is possible that earlyidentification of patients suffering from JIA with extensive joint destructionand little symptoms could benefit from AS, delaying joint destruction andpreserving function.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Vascular Morphogenesis in the Context of Inflammation: Self-Organization in a Fibrin-Based 3D Culture System.,/pubmed/29922175,"Introduction: New vessel formation requires a continuous and tightly regulatedinterplay between endothelial cells with cells of the perivascularmicroenvironment supported by mechanic-physical and chemical cues from theextracellular matrix. Aim: Here we investigated the potential of small fragments of synovial tissue to form de novo vascular structures in the context ofinflammation within three dimensional (3D) fibrin-based matrices in vitro, andassessed the contribution of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-immune cellcross-talk to neovascularization considering paracrine signals in a fibrin-based co-culture model. Material and Methods: Synovial tissue fragments from patientswith rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA) werecultivated within 3D fibrin matrices for up to 4 weeks. Cellular and structuralre-arrangement of the initially acellular matrix were documented by phasecontrast microscopy and characterized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy oftopographically intact 3D cultures and by immunohistochemistry. MSC-peripheralblood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-cultures in the 3D fibrin system specificallyaddressed the influence of perivascular cell interactions to neo-vessel formationin a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Cytokine levels in the supernatants ofcultured explant tissues and co-cultures were evaluated by the Bio-Plex cytokine assay and ELISA. Results: Vascular outgrowth from the embedded tissue into thefibrin matrix was preceded by leukocyte egress from the tissue fragments.Neo-vessels originating from both the embedded sample and from clusters locallyformed by emigrated mononuclear cells were consistently associated with CD45+leukocytes. MSC and PBMC in co-culture formed vasculogenic clusters. Clusters andcells with endothelial phenotype emerging from them, were surrounded by acollagen IV scaffold. No vascular structures were observed in control 3Dmonocultures of PBMC or MSC. Paracrine signals released by cultured OA tissuefragments corresponded with elevated levels of granulocyte-colony stimulatingfactor, vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 secreted by MSC-PBMCco-cultures. Conclusion: Our results show that synovial tissue fragments withimmune cell infiltrates have the potential to form new vessels in initiallyavascular 3D fibrin-based matrices. Cross-talk and cluster formation of MSC with immune cells within the 3D fibrin environment through self-organization andsecretion of pro-angiogenic paracrine factors can support neo-vessel growth.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Metabolic syndrome in adults with a history of juvenile arthritis.,/pubmed/29922101,"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of obesity andmetabolic syndrome in adults with a history of juvenile arthritis (JA).Methods: Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we compared the characteristics of respondents with arthritis (JA vs rheumatoidarthritis [RA]) to those of the control group without arthritis. We used logisticregression analyses, controlling for age, race, and gender, to determine the ORs for metabolic syndrome.Results: Obesity was increased in the JA group with 67% respondents having bodymass index ³30 kg/m2 vs 55% respondents in the no arthritis cohort (p=0.004). In unadjusted analyses, there was increased odds of metabolic syndrome in JA (OR6.2, p=0.001) and RA groups compared to those without arthritis (OR 7.7,p=0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and race, the odds of metabolicsyndrome remained increased in JA (OR 5.2, p=0.001) and RA (OR 3.2, p=0.001)groups.Conclusion: Adults with a history of JA have a significantly increased risk ofmetabolic syndrome compared to those without arthritis. These findings areimportant because metabolic syndrome has been associated with an increased riskof cardiovascular disease and death in other populations.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Factors correlated with the improvement of endothelial dysfunction during Abatacept therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29922080,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis patients are exposed to a high risk ofcardiovascular morbidity and mortality even in the early phases of the disease.Methods: We evaluated carotid common carotid intimal media thickness (ccIMT)intimal thickness and brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of 45 rheumatoidarthritis patients without known cardiovascular risk factors or heart disease on a stable dose of prednisone 5.2±1.2 mg/day and Methotrexate 11.5±2.1 mg atbaseline (T0) and after 12 months (T1) of treatment with Abatacept 125 mg/week.The comparison between T0 and T1 (t- and Mann-Whitney test), correlation(Spearman r), and predictivity (linear regression) of FMD, ccIMT vs clinical and laboratory parameters (disease activity 28 score, tumor necrosis factor alpha[TNF_], interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+, CD19+(B), CD20+(B), NK CD3-CD56+CD16+, CD14+ HLA DR+,CD4+CD28+, CD4+CD28, rheumatoid factor IgM, IgA, RF IgG, anti-citrullinatedpeptide antibodies) were also evaluated.Results: During Abatacept treatment, ccIMT and FMD remained stable and diseaseactivity 28 score, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6decreased significantly (p=0.0001, 0.002, 0.0002, 0.0001 respectively).

Current treatment options for psoriatic arthritis: spotlight on abatacept.,/pubmed/29922065,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of joints, tendonsheaths, and entheses affecting patients with established skin psoriasis, or,less frequently, patients without a personal history of psoriasis with a positivefamilial history. Many treatment options are now available to deal with thedifferent aspects of the disease, including traditional and biologicaldisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the recently released targetedsynthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However, ~40% of patients still fail to achieve a meaningful clinical response to first-line biologic therapyadvocating the development of novel medications. It is now well accepted thatT-cells participate in the immunopathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. Forthis reason, the potential intervention on T-cells represented an attractivetherapeutic target for a long time, becoming a clinical reality with thedevelopment of abatacept. Abatacept is a biologic agent selectively targeting theT-cell costimulatory signal delivered through the CD80/86-CD28 pathway and wasapproved in December 2005 by the US Food and Drug Administration and in May 2007 by European Medicines Agency for the treatment of patients with rheumatoidarthritis in combination with methotrexate. Based on the relevant role of T-cellsin PsA pathogenesis and following the positive results obtained in a phase IIIclinical trial, abatacept recently received approval for treatment of patientswith PsA.

Dietary Long-Chain n-3 Fatty Acid Intake and Arthritis Risk in the Women's Health Initiative.,/pubmed/29921541,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of arthritis in the United States is substantial andon the rise. Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which haveanti-inflammatory properties, have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit toarthritis patients; however, to date few have examined these associations witharthritis risk.OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to examine the associations of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoidarthritis (RA) risk among postmenopausal women.DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study.PARTICIPANTS: The sample for this analysis consisted of 80,551 postmenopausalwomen, aged 55 to 79 years and with no history of arthritis, recruited into theWomen's Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials cohort between 1993 and 1998. Women completed a 120-item food frequency questionnaire atbaseline.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: After a median follow-up of 8 years, 22,306 incident OAand 3,348 RA cases were identified.STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Adjusted Cox regression models were used toestimate hazard ratios and 95% CI for the associations between dietary LCn-3PUFA intake and OA and RA risk.RESULTS: Individual and total long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(Quintile 5 vs Quintile 1: hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.09 for OA; hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13 for RA) were not associated with OA and RA risk. Further, no associations were observed between n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acidsintake and either arthritis outcome.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine associations of long-chain n-3polyunsaturated fatty acids intake with OA risk and the largest to examineassociations with RA risk.

Presence of hepatitis B virus in synovium and its clinical significance in rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29921328,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have revealed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infectionmay be related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but there are no studies on thepresence of HBV antigens or nucleic acid in synovium from patients with RA withHBV infection. In the present study, we investigated the presence of HBV in thesynovium and its clinical significance in RA.METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive patients with active RA (Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment based on C-reactive protein ³_2.6) and available synovialtissue who had completed 1 year of follow-up were recruited from a prospectivecohort. The patients were divided into chronic HBV infection (CHB, n_=_11) andnon-CHB groups according to baseline HBV infection status. Clinical data werecollected at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Radiographicchanges of hand/wrist at baseline and month 12 were assessed with the Sharp/vander Heijde-modified Sharp score (mTSS). HBV in synovium was determined byimmunohistochemical staining for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) and by nested PCR for the HBV S gene.RESULTS: HBcAg was found in the synovium of patients with RA with CHB (7 of 11,64%), which was confirmed by PCR for the HBV S gene. Compared with the non-CHBgroup, more CD68-positive macrophages, CD20-positive B cells, and CD15-positiveneutrophils infiltrated the synovium in the CHB group (all p_<_Ê0.05). There weresmaller improvements from baseline in most disease activity indicators mainly at month 12, and a significantly higher percentage of CHB patients experienced1-year radiographic progression (_mTSS ³_0.5 unit/yr, 64% vs. 26%, p_=_0.024).Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CHB status (OR 14.230, 95% CI 2.213-95.388; p_=_0.006) and the density of synovial CD68-positive macrophages(OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.001-1.003; p_=_0.003) were independently associated with1-year radiographic progression.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of HBV in RA synovium may be involved in thepathogenesis of local lesions and exacerbate disease progression in RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Patient-reported outcomes from a randomized phase III trial of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29921318,"BACKGROUND: The phase III MONARCH randomized controlled trial (NCT02332590)demonstrated that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sarilumab(anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody) monotherapy is superior toadalimumab monotherapy in reducing disease activity and signs and symptoms of RA,as well as in improving physical function, with similar rates of adverse andserious adverse events. We report the effects of sarilumab versus adalimumab onpatient-reported outcomes (PROs).METHODS: Patients with active RA intolerant of, or inadequate responders to,methotrexate were randomized to sarilumab 200Êmg plus placebo every 2Êweeks (q2w;n_=_184) or adalimumab 40Êmg plus placebo q2w (n_=_185). Dose escalation toweekly administration of adalimumab or matching placebo was permitted at week 16.PROs assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24 included patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGA), pain and morning stiffness visual analogue scales(VASs), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic IllnessTherapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID), andrheumatoid arthritis-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS-RA).

Treatment effect of CDKN1A on rheumatoid arthritis by mediating proliferation and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes cells.,/pubmed/29920650,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of CDKN1A in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).METHODS: Related gene expression data screened from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)were processed with network analysis. Protein-protein interaction was analyzedthrough string database. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure mRNA and microRNA expressions. Cellproliferation and cell cycle were tested by MTT assay and flow cytometryrespectively. Transwell migration and invasion assay was used to test cellmigration and invasion.RESULTS: CDKN1A screened by bioinformatics methods showed differential expressionin RA cells compared with healthy controls (HC), and was at an important positionin protein-protein interaction network of RA. Compared with HC group, CDKN1A was down-regulated in human RA synovium tissues and human fibroblast-likesynoviocytes (HFLS). Contrary to CDKN1A silencing, CDKN1A overexpressionsignificantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HFLS-RA, arrestedHFLS-RA in G0/G1 phase, and down-regulated the expressions of TNF_ and IL6 while up-regulated the expression of IL10. CDKN1A overexpression could also suppresspSTAT1 expression. MiR-146a, highly expressed in RA tissues, could negativelyregulate CDKN1A. Anti-146a suppressed cell proliferation and invasion, and at thesame time enhanced IL10 expression but inhibited IL6, TNF_ and pSTAT1 expression.CONCLUSION: The results indicated that CDKN1A overexpression, which could beenhanced by miR-146a suppression, inhibited the proliferation, invasion inHFLS-RA. This was probably a result of suppressed pSTAT1, IL6 and TNF_ expressionand enhanced IL10 expression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The microbiome in autoimmune diseases.,/pubmed/29920643,"The microbiome is represented by microorganisms which live in a symbiotic waywith the mammalian. The microorganisms have the ability to influence differentphysiological aspects such as the immune system, metabolism and behaviour. In thelast years, several studies have highlighted the role of the microbiome in thepathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Notably, in systemic lupus erythematosus an alteration of the intestinal flora (lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio) wasdescribed. On the other hand, changes to the gut commensal and periodontaldisease were proposed as important factors to the pathogenesis of rheumatoidarthritis. At the same time, other autoimmune diseases (i.e. systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome) shared modifications of themicrobiome in the intestinal tract and oral flora as well. Herein, we describethe role of the microbiome in the maintenance homeostasis of the immune systemand then the alterations of the microorganism that occur in systemic autoimmunediseases. Finally, we will consider the use of probiotics and fecaltransplantation as a novel therapeutic targets. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical utility of bone markers in various diseases.,/pubmed/29920402,"Measurements of bone markers (BMs) in peripheral blood or urine are a pivotalpart of bone research within modern clinical medicine. In recent years the use ofBMs increased substantially as they can be useful either to diagnose bone(related) disease and to follow its natural history, but also to monitor theeffects of interventions. However, the use of BMs is still complicated mainly dueto (pre)analytical variability of these substances, limited accessibility ofassays, variable cut-off values in different countries and laboratories andheterogeneous results with regard to clinical implications of measuring BMs inseveral studies. This review will provide the clinician with a practical guide,based on current evidence, in which circumstances to test which bone markers for optimal diagnostic purposes, in order to improve patient care in different areas of bone diseases including Paget's disease, primary osteoporosis, tumor inducedosteomalacia, hypophosphatemic rickets, van Buchem disease, chronic kidneydisease, rheumatoid arthritis, neoplasma/multiple myeloma, type 2 diabetesmellitus and primary hyperparathyroidism. The clinician should consider fastingstate, recent fractures, aging, menopausal status, concomitant liver and kidneydisease when ordering and interpreting BM measurements as these factors mightresult in misleading BM concentrations. We found that BMs are clearly useful inthe current diagnosis of tumor induced osteomalacia, van Buchem disease, Paget's disease and hypophosphatemic rickets. In addition, BMs are useful to monitordisease activity in chronic kidney disease, Paget's disease and are useful tomonitor treatment adherence in osteoporosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,

EG aqueous ethanolic extract (30:70)and its aqueous, n-butanol and ethyl acetate fractions at 200mg/kg were orallyadministered from day 0, 30min prior to adjuvant injection and sustained for 28days. Paw volume/diameter, arthritic score, body weight, and hematological (WBC, RBC, ESR, Hb and Platelet count) and biochemical (AST, ALT, ALP, urea,creatinine, CRP and RF) parameters were observed. The mRNA expression levels ofCOX-2, IL-1_, IL-6, NF-kB, TNF-_, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by real timereverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) while, PGE2 and TNF-_levels in serum samples were measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Moreover, radiographs of hind paws and histological changes in anklejoint were analyzed in adjuvant injected rats. In addition, anti-oxidant activityof plant extract and fractions was also evaluated using DPPH and reducing powerassays. Also, preliminary phytochemistry and total phenolic and flavonoidcontents were investigated in most active fraction (aqueous fraction).RESULTS: EG extract and fractions (notably aqueous fraction) significantlysuppressed paw swelling and arthritic score, prevented cachexia and remarkablyameliorated hematological and biochemical changes. Furthermore, theoverproduction of PGE2, COX-2, IL-1_, IL-6, NF-kB and TNF-_ were remarkablyattenuated in all EG treated rats, however, IL-4 and 10 were markedly increased. The radiographic and histopathologic improvement in joint architecture was alsoobserved in EG treated rats. Piroxicam, used as reference drug, alsosignificantly suppressed arthritis. Additionally, plant exhibited notableanti-oxidant activity and phytochemical analysis revealed the presence ofalkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins and glycosides.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that EG extract and fractions significantlyattenuated adjuvant arthritis in rats by decreasing the levels of aforementioned pro-inflammatory and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory mediators. Thissuggests that Ephedra gerardiana aerial parts might be used as a therapeuticagent for treating human arthritis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-inflammation and joint lubrication dual effects of a novel hyaluronic acid/curcumin nanomicelle improve the efficacy of rheumatoid arthritis therapy.,/pubmed/29920067,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, which cancause endless suffering to the patients and severely impact their normal lives.To treat RA, the drugs in use have many serious side effects, high cost or onlyfocus on their anti-inflammatory mechanisms without taking joint lubrication intoconsideration. Therefore, in this study, we aim to construct a novel anti-RA drugcomposed of hyaluronic acid/curcumin (HA/Cur) nanomicelle to resolve theseproblems. Characterizations show that Cur is bound to HA by ester linkages, andself-assembles to form a spherical nanomicelle with a diameter of around 164 nmunder the main driving of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces. The nanomicelleenjoys excellent biocompatibility that effectively promotes the proliferation of chondrocytes. When injected to the RA rats, the nanomicelle significantly lowers the edema degree of the arthritic rats compared to other groups; more critically,a dramatic decrease in friction between the surfaces of cartilage around thejoints has been found, which protects the cartilage from the RA-induced damage.Additionally, systematic mechanism investigation indicates that the nanomicellediminishes the expression of related cytokines and vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF), finally leading to the excellent performance. The newfoundnanomicelle has potential for clinical practice of RA therapy, which willcontribute significantly to alleviating the pain of patients and improving thequality of life for them.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Acute Glaucoma Following Cyanoacrylate Glue Patch for Corneal Perforation.,/pubmed/29916996,"PURPOSE: To describe a case of acute glaucoma after cyanoacrylate gluing for anon-traumatic central corneal perforation.METHODS: A 55-year-old woman with history of rheumatoid arthritis and severe dry eye presented to emergency with a right central corneal perforation. She wastreated successfully with the use cyanoacrylate glue patch but iridocornealadhesions remained. The next day she presented with ocular pain, headaches andvomiting. On examination she had shallow anterior chamber with no aqueous leakagebut her intraocular pressure was 56_mm Hg measured with rebound tonometry. Ananterior segment OCT scan showed a 360 degrees central iris adhesion with shallowAC. Topical and oral treatment for acute glaucoma was given that decreased herintraocular pressure. She then underwent urgent surgery to release theiridocorneal adhesions and restore aqueous flow that was achieved withoutreplacing the glue patch.RESULTS: One day postoperatively her right eye was comfortable and her IOPmeasurement remained within normal limits. The anterior chamber was deep with no iridocorneal adhesions.CONCLUSIONS: Close monitoring of the intraocular pressure is recommendable incentral corneal perforations with iris adhesions managed with cyanoacrylate glue due to the potential developing of aqueous blockage.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Rates of Neuropsychological Dysfunction in Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis: An Automated Clinical Rating Approach.,/pubmed/29916966,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome of unknownetiology that can include subjective cognitive symptoms and variable evidence of cognitive dysfunction. Rates of occurrence and severity of cognitive impairmentremain unclear. Additionally, comparison of this group with other pain conditionshas been limited. The current cross-sectional study sought to identify rates ofclinically significant cognitive impairment in FM and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)using an automated clinical rating approach.METHODS: A total of 62 females (32 with FM, 29 with RA) completed a comprehensiveneuropsychological (NP) battery and an assessment of personality andpsychological distress. All study measures were completed in one visit and allparticipants were recruited over the span of 3 years. Demographically correctedNP scores were used to compare participants with normative expectations and asummary score was calculated to compare groups on NP impairment.RESULTS: Compared to normative expectations using a 1 standard deviation cutoff, moderately increased rates of cognitive deficits were observed in both groups (FM= 23.3%, RA = 34.5%), with most test scores in affected individuals falling inthe mild to moderate ranges of impairment. Compared to RA, FM participantsendorsed higher and significant levels of psychological symptoms overall. Thesewere not associated with cognitive performance in either patient group.CONCLUSIONS: Increased rates of cognitive dysfunction as well as psychologicaldistress exist in both FM and RA compared to a normative sample. However,psychological distress was unrelated to cognition in both groups. These findings have implications regarding the clinical presentation of individuals with FM and RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"The NRF2ÛÔPGCÛÔ1ë_ pathway activates kynurenine aminotransferase 4 via attenuation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, synoviolin, in a cecal ligation/perforationÛÔinduced septic mouse model.",/pubmed/29916549,"Sepsis_associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome of which the precise associated mechanisms remain unclear. Synoviolin(Syvn1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in conditions associated with chronic inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, fibrosis and livercirrhosis. However, the role of Syvn1 in acute inflammation is not clear. The aimof the present study was to investigate the role of Syvn1 in a septic mouse modelinduced by cecal ligation/perforation (CLP). Metabolome analysis revealed thatkynurenine (KYN), a key factor for the development of neuroinflammation, wasincreased in CLP_induced septic mice. Notably, KYN was not detected inCLP_induced septic Syvn1_deficient mice. KYN is converted to kynurenic acid(KYNA) by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), which has a neuroprotectiveeffect. The expression of KAT4 was significantly increased in Syvn1_deficientmice compared to that in wild_type mice. Promoter analysis demonstrated thatSyvn1 knockdown induced the KAT4 promoter activity, as assessed by luciferasereporter activity, whereas Syvn1 overexpression repressed this activity in adose_dependent manner. Furthermore, the KAT4 promoter was significantly activatedby the transcriptional factors, NF_E2_related factorÊ2 and peroxisomeproliferator_activated receptor coactivatorÊ1_, which are targets ofSyvn1_induced degradation. In conclusion, the results of the current studydemonstrates that the repression of Syvn1 expression induces the conversion ofneurotoxic KYN to neuroprotective KYNA in a CLP_induced mouse model of sepsis,and that Syvn1 is a potential novel target for the treatment of SAE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Montelukast inhibits RANKLÛÔinduced osteoclast formation and bone loss via CysLTR1 and P2Y12.,/pubmed/29916540,"Osteoclasts (OCs) are resorptive cells responsible for bone erosion in diseases, including osteoporosis, periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) antagonist clinically used for thetreatment of asthma. In the present study, the role of CysLTR1 on OC formationand bone loss was investigated using montelukast. Montelukast inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor__B ligand (RANKL)_induced OC formation in cultures ofmouse bone marrow macrophages. Additionally, montelukast suppressed actin ringformation and bone resorption activity of differentiated OCs. The inhibitoryeffect of montelukast was associated with impaired activation of extracellularsignal_regulated kinase, AKT serine/threonine kinase, and/or phospholipase C_2signaling pathways downstream of RANK, followed by decreased expression ofnuclear factor of activated T cells c1. Notably, OC formation was efficientlyrestored by addition of adenosine diphosphate, a P2Y12 agonist, as well as byaddition of CysLT. Furthermore, similar to montelukast, P2Y12 blockade by apharmacological inhibitor or siRNAs suppressed OC differentiation. These dataindicate the involvement of the P2Y12 receptor in the inhibitory effect ofmontelukast on osteoclastogenesis. InÊvivo, montelukast significantly inhibitedinflammation_induced osteoclastogenesis in the calvarial model. Montelukast also served a protective role in a murine ovariectomy (OVX)_ and unloading_inducedbone loss model. Altogether, these results confirmed that the CysLTR1 antagonist exerted an inhibitory effect on OC formation inÊvitro and inÊvivo.

Identifying markers of sustained remission in rheumatoid arthritis patients on long-term tapered biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,/pubmed/29915991,"To identify features associated with long-term persistent remission in rheumatoidarthritis (RA) patients on tapered biological disease-modifying antirheumaticdrugs (bDMARD) (tap-bDMARD) therapy. We carried out a 40-month (m) extensionfollow-up study of 77 RA patients from a previous 12Êm tap-bDMARD study. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 3 months. Doppler US investigation of42 joints for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode synovial hypertrophy (SH)and synovial power Doppler signal (i.e., Doppler synovitis) was performed before starting the tap-bDMARD strategy by a rheumatologist blinded to clinical andlaboratory data. At the 40Êm mark, 44 (57.1%) patients failed the tap-bDMARDstrategy, while 33 (42.9%) succeeded. Patients who presented a failed tap-bDMARD had significantly longer disease duration, a longer time from symptom onset tosynthetic (s) DMARD start, longer duration of sDMARD treatment, a greater number of sDMARDs, and a higher baseline DAS28 and SDAI than patients with successfultap-bDMARD at 40 months. In logistic regression analysis, the presence ofbaseline Doppler synovitis, a DAS28_³_2.2, and the presence of rheumatoid factor were identified as predictors of tap-bDMARD failure at 40Êm. In those patientswho succeed tap-bDMARD at 12Êm, a smoking habit was significantly more frequentlyfound in tap-bDMARD failures at 40Êm.

Stable expression of infliximab in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BAK1-deficient CHO cells.,/pubmed/29915899,"OBJECTIVES: To establish stable infliximab-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)cells with high tolerance to serum-free culture.RESULTS: Bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1), which is a key mediator of theapoptosis pathway, was disrupted, and infliximab, which is a broadly usedmonoclonal antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and otherautoimmune diseases, was incorporated into the BAK1 locus of the CHO chromosomeusing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas genome-editing technique. The activating effects of serum starvation on BAK1 and cytochrome C (CytC) were suppressed in the genome-edited cells, and the abilityof the cells to resist the serum starvation-induced loss of mitochondrialmembrane potential and apoptosis was increased, as indicated by the results ofpolymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Inaddition, during subsequent passages, infliximab could be stably produced in the genome-edited CHO cells, and the recombinant antibody could effectivelyantagonize the cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis factor _ (TNF_).CONCLUSIONS: A CHO cell line capable of stably expressing infliximab and adaptingto serum-free culture was constructed.

However, it remains unclear how the activation of Tfh cells is driven in autoimmune diseases. Here, we report that in patients withrheumatoid arthritis (RA), excessive generation of CXCR5+PD-1+ memory Tfh cellswas observed and the frequency of memory Tfh cells correlated with diseaseactivity score calculator for RA (DAS28). The differentiation of Tfh cells isdependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the key transcription factor downstream of cytokine signal pathways.

The present studyevaluated systemic and articular effects of Kava-241 in an infective arthritismurine model triggered by P.gingivalis bacterial inoculation and primed withcollagen antibody cocktail (CIA) to induce joint inflammation and tissulardestruction. Clinical inflammation score and radiological analysis of the pawswere performed continuously while histological assessment was obtained atsacrifice.

Materials and methods: We studied 43 pSjSpatients fulfilling the AECG criteria and 30 age/sex-matched healthy controls, aswell as 39 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as a disease control group. ESSDAI scores were less than seven in all patients with pSjS, indicating low diseaseactivity. Quantitative analyses were made in serum and whole saliva samples.

In the pSjS group, those parameters did not show anycorrelation with disease duration, seropositivity, and smoking. Conclusion:Despite low disease activity, saliva TNF-_ and caspase-1 levels were found to be significantly higher in the pSjS group, which may suggest a possible advantage oflocal anticytokine treatments in selected cases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"The effect of glucocorticoids on bone mineral density in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.",/pubmed/29913256,"PURPOSE: The role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is widely debated. Impairment of bone formation may be counter-balanced byreduced systemic inflammation. This review aims to assess the effect ofprednisolone/prednisone on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with RAanalyzed in randomized, controlled trials.METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search and identified randomized,double-blinded placebo-controlled studies including patients with RA and usingprednisolone or prednisone as the intervention. We selected studies that measuredBMD by DXA at baseline and at least once thereafter. Two authors independentlyperformed reference review, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Primary outcome was mean change in BMD from baseline to follow-up. Secondary endpointsincluded radiographic scores, RA disease activity indices and fractures. We ratedthe quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes were standardized for meta-analyses and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.RESULTS: We identified 7 studies and included previously unpublished data.Studies were similar regarding study population and intervention. Standard meandifference (SMD) in change in BMD from 0 to 24_months was -0.02 (95%CI -0.16,0.12) at the lumbar spine and -0.11 (95% CI -0.25, 0.02) at the hip (both highquality evidence) between patients treated with prednisolone/prednisone or not.Data completeness was low in some studies, concomitant treatment of RA differedbetween studies and differences in use of anti-osteoporotic medication may haveinfluenced the results. However, sensitivity analyses excluding studies in which participants used either the most or the least potent concomitant RA treatment orused anti-osteoporotic therapies did not alter the estimates.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early and active RA, we found no difference inchange in BMD between patients treated with prednisone/prednisolone versusplacebo, suggesting that at least through 24_months, the suppression ofinflammation by glucocorticoids may counterbalance their adverse effects on bone remodeling.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Associations between swallowing disorders,medical factors, RA disease severity, and quality of life were examined.RESULTS: Forty-one percent of participants reported a current swallowing disorderthat began gradually and was longstanding (most experiencing symptoms on a daily basis for at least 4 years). Symptoms compatible with solid food dysphagiacontributed disproportionately to reporting a current swallowing disorder. Riskfactors for dysphagia included a self-reported voice disorder, thyroid problems, esophageal reflux, and being physically inactive. Swallowing disorders increased with self-reported RA disease severity and contributed to a significantly greaterburden on overall quality of life.CONCLUSION: Chronic, longstanding swallowing disorders are common in individuals with RA and appear to increase with disease severity.

Leptin is historically one of most relevant adipokines, withimportant physiological roles in the central control of energy metabolism and in the regulation of metabolism-immune system interplay, being a cornerstone of the emerging field of immunometabolism. Indeed, leptin receptor is expressedthroughout the immune system and leptin has been shown to regulate both innateand adaptive immune responses.

Treatments included corticosteroids (CS), hyaluronicacid (HA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Weextracted study details, patient demographics, treatment characteristics,efficacy outcomes, and safety. When feasible, data from RCTs were meta-analyzedusing a random-effects model and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: We identified 27 studies (1085 patients). Ankle OA, rheumatoid arthritis(RA), and hemophilic arthropathy populations were examined. The majority ofstudies were observational (20 studies); the only RCTs were those evaluating HA. Case series demonstrated favorable results in terms of symptomatic relief withCS, HA, PRP, and MSC injections; however, the effects of CS may only be shortterm and the evidence on MSCs was limited to 1 study with 6 ankle OA patients.Pooled results (3 RCTs, 109 patients) suggested significantly improved AnkleOsteoarthritis Scale scores with HA over saline at 6 months, with a meandifference of 12.47 points (95% CI 1.18-23.77, P = .03).CONCLUSION: Evidence from small trials favors HA and PRP injections for thetreatment of pain associated with ankle osteoarthritis.

Glycosylation as new pharmacological strategies for diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis.,/pubmed/29909237,"Angiogenesis is a complex process describing the growth of new blood vessels fromexisting vasculature, and is triggered by local pro-angiogenic factors, such asvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which increase the metabolism ofendothelial cells (ECs). Angiogenesis takes part in various physiologicalconditions such as embryogenesis, placental growth, and in pathologicalconditions such as tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ischemic diseases. Current therapies against excessive angiogenesis targetvascular growth signaling. However, tumors often counteract these therapiesthrough adaptive mechanisms, thus novel alternative anti-angiogenic strategiesare needed. Targeting metabolism is a new anti-angiogenic paradigm, especiallythrough the inhibition of energy metabolism and glycosylation, with theperspective of maintaining the delicate balance between the beneficial anddeleterious effects of excessive angiogenesis in patients. Recent studiesdescribed a role for EC glycolysis and its main regulator6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in the regulationof angiogenesis, but only few studies are related to the role of the hexosaminebiosynthesis pathway during angiogenesis. Glycosylation allows the formation ofglycoproteins, glycolipids and proteoglycans and impacts many pathways. Theaddition of glycans to N-linked proteins is catalyzed by the enzymatic activityof N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnTs), which regulates the glycosylationstatus of key angiogenic factors such as VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Notch. Inaddition, glycan-galectin (Gal) interactions regulate vascular signaling programsand may contribute to tumor adaptations to anti-angiogenic strategies. Herein, wereview novel pharmacological strategies targeting glycosylation, which could beused to decrease excessive angiogenesis in pathological conditions.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Exposures to nebulized HQ (25_ppm), saline solution or HQvehicle solution (5% ethanol in saline) were carried out for 1 h, once a day, on days 21-27 after CIA induction. On day 27, animals were euthanized and sampleswere collected for further analyses. Exposure to HQ caused loss of weight,intensified paw edema, enhanced levels of tumor necrosis factor-_ (TNF-_) andanti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) in the serum; augmented synoviocyteproliferation and influx of aril hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) positive cells intothe synovial membrane, altered collagen fibre rearrangement in the synovia, andsynoviocytes isolated from HQ exposed rats secreted higher levels ofpro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-_ and interleukin-1_. Associated, we point out HQas an environmental pollutant that aggravates RA, suggesting its participation onworsening RA in smoking patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Delivery System for Budesonide Based on Lipid-DNA.,/pubmed/29908939,"Budesonide is a hydrophobic glucocorticoid with high anti-inflammatory activityfor the treatment of asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.A micellar drug-delivery system based on lipid-DNA may provide a strategy tomaximize its drug efficacy and reduce adverse effects. In this work, we reportthe use of lipid-DNA (UU11mer), featuring two hydrophobic alkyl chains andforming micelles at a comparatively low critical micelle concentration, to renderbudesonide water-soluble with a high loading capacity (LC). The inhibition ofinterleukin-8 (IL-8) release shows that the new delivery system retains theinhibitory activity in cell-based assays. In conclusion, this research provides anovel approach to formulate and administer budesonide in a non-invasive manner,which dramatically improves its water-solubility while retains itsbioavailability.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Ferulic acid, a dietary polyphenol suppresses osteoclast differentiation and bone erosion via the inhibition of RANKL dependent NF-ë¼B signalling pathway.",/pubmed/29908722,"AIMS: Bone erosion induced by enhanced osteoclast formation is a debilitatingpathological phenomenon in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent finding has revealedthat ferulic acid is associated with reduced osteoclast differentiation and bone erosion. However, the underlying mechanism through which ferulic acid inhibitedosteoclast differentiation and bone erosion still remains to be elucidated. This study assessed the therapeutic effects of ferulic acid on osteoclastdifferentiation and bone erosion by targeting RANKL dependent NF-_B pathway.MAIN METHODS: RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells were left untreated/treatedwith 25, 50 and 100__M ferulic acid prior to stimulation with/without RANKL andM-CSF. Osteoclast differentiation and formation was assessed by SEM and TRAPanalysis whereas its functional activity of bone erosion was determined by pitformation assay. Crucial transcription factors (NF-_Bp-65, NFATc1 and c-Fos) and osteoclast specific genes (TRAP, MMP-9 and Cathepsin K) were evaluated byquantitative RT-PCR. Further, the protein level expression of NF-_Bp-65, NFAtc1, c-Fos and MMP-9 was assessed using western blot analysis.KEY FINDINGS: Our results demonstrated that ferulic acid significantly attenuatedRANKL induced osteoclast differentiation as evidenced from SEM and TRAP staining analysis. A remarkable decrease in the bone resorption activity of osteoclastswas also noticed upon ferulic acid treatment. In addition, the down-regulation ofRANKL induced NF-_B activation and its associated downstream factors like NFATc1,c-Fos, TRAP, Cathepsin K and MMP-9 was also observed upon ferulic acid treatment.SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, our findings evidence the anti-stimulatory andanti-resorptive role of ferulic acid via the inhibition of RANKL dependent NF-_B signalling pathway.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Determination of serum bone-related minerals during denosumab treatment in osteoporosis patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Mineral change by denosumab in osteoporosis with rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29908683,"OBJECTIVES: This study included 51 osteoporosis patients with rheumatoidarthritis (RA) who were treated with anti-resorption drug, denosumab. To date,there has been no report on the changes of bone-related minerals afteranti-resorption drug therapy.METHODS: Fifty one osteoporotic patients with RA were retrospectively enrolled.Serum Zinc (Zn), Magnesium (Mg), Iron (Fe), and Copper (Cu) were examined at 1week, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 months. Lumbar spine (L1-4) bone mineral density(L-BMD), and bilateral total hip BMD (H-BMD) were examined before and at 6 and 12months after treatment commencement.RESULTS: Serum Fe gradually increased except at 4 and 10 months, andsignificantly increased at 12 months. Serum Mg slightly decreased at 1 week and 1month, then increased up to 4 months, then gradually decreased to 8 months, then increased thereafter. Serum Zn significantly increased at every time point exceptat 1 week during the period. Serum Cu increased during the period but slightlydecreased at 2, 8, and 12 months. L-BMD as well as H-BMD significantly increased at 12 months (5.1% and 5.1%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab might be a good option to improve bone-related minerals inOP patients with RA even without dietary supplement. Serum Fe and Mg valuesbecame approximately within normal range after the therapy. On the other hand,serum Zn significantly increased for 12 months, however, the Zn values showedstill low status after the treatment. Thus, Zn supplementation and/or nutritioneducation are basically required for OP patients with RA, even though denosumabincreases serum Zn level.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We did this study to further assess the safety andefficacy of upadacitinib in patients with an inadequate response to biologicdisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).METHODS: We did this double-blind, randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 153sites in 26 countries. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had activerheumatoid arthritis and previous inadequate response or intolerance to bDMARDs, and were receiving concomitant background conventional synthetic DMARDS(csDMARDs). We randomly assigned patients (2:2:1:1) by interactive responsetechnology to receive once-daily oral extended-release upadacitinib 15 mg or 30mg or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg from week 12 onwards. The two separate primary endpoints were the proportions of patientsachieving a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 12 and the proportion of patients achieving a 28-joint disease activityscore using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3á2 or less at week 12. Efficacyand safety analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population ofall patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Data are presented up to week 24 of this ongoing study. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov(NCT02706847).FINDINGS: Between March 15, 2016, and Jan 10, 2017, 499 patients were randomlyassigned (n=165 upadacitinib 15 mg; n=165 upadacitinib 30 mg; n=85 placebo thenupadacitinib 15 mg; and n=84 placebo then upadacitinib 30 mg) and one patient waswithdrawn from the 15 mg upadacitinib group before the start of study treatment. Mean disease duration was 13á2 years (SD 9á5); 235 (47%) of 498 patients hadreceived one previous bDMARD, 137 (28%) had received two, and 125 (25%) hadreceived at least three; 451 (91%) patients completed treatment up to week 12 and419 (84%) patients completed treatment up to week 24.

Up to week 12, overall numbers ofpatients with adverse events were similar for the placebo group (95 [56%] of 169)and the upadacitinib 15 mg group (91 [55%] of 164), but higher in theupadacitinib 30 mg group (111 [67%] of 165). At week 12, the most common adverse events occurring in at least 5% of patients in any treatment group were upperrespiratory tract infection (13 [8%] of 169 in the placebo group; 13 [8%] of 164 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; ten [6%] of 165 in the upadacitinib 30 mggroup), nasopharyngitis (11 [7%]; seven [4%]; nine [5%]), urinary tract infection(ten [6%]; 15 [9%]; nine [5%]), and worsening of rheumatoid arthritis (ten [6%]; four [2%]; six [4%]). The number of patients with serious adverse events washigher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group (12 [7%]) than in the upadacitinib 15 mggroup (eight [5%]); no serious adverse events were reported in patients receivingplacebo. More patients in the upadacitinib 30 mg group had serious infections,herpes zoster, and adverse events leading to discontinuation than in theupadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups. During the placebo-controlled phase of thestudy, one case of pulmonary embolism, three malignancies, one major adversecardiovascular event, and one death were reported in patients receivingupadacitinib; none were reported in patients receiving placebo.INTERPRETATION: Both doses of upadacitinib led to rapid and significantimprovements compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with refractoryrheumatoid arthritis.",RCT,,,,Upadacitinib,Placebo,,,Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis refractory to biologic disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs,Proportions of patients achieving a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria at week 12 and the proportion of patients achieving a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein of 3.2 or less at week 12,

Biocompatible PEGylated Gold nanorods function As cytokinesis inhibitors to suppress angiogenesis.,/pubmed/29908342,"Pathological angiogenesis is driven by uncontrolled growth of endothelial cells(ECs), which could lead to retinopathy, tumor and rheumatoid arthritis, etc. ECs must experience multiple cell division process to grow, and cytokinesis is thefinal step. The present study shows that PEGylated GNRs (PEG-GNRs) specificallytarget ECs cytokinesis process which results in high ratio of binucleated cells, and these binucleated ECs lose the ability to proliferate. Further data show thatPEG-GNRs do not induce toxicity inÊvitro and inÊvivo. PEG-GNRs could inhibit ECs proliferation, migration, tube formation and inhibit angiogenesis in exÊvivomodel. Oxygen induced retinopathy and tumor angiogenesis model further show that PEG-GNRs can inhibit angiogenesis inÊvivo. Gene expression profiles reveal thatPEG-GNRs mainly affect ECs cell division process, and PEG-GNRs treated ECs arearrested in G2/M phase. The mechanism is that PEG-GNRs could disrupt TGF_pathway, and subsequently suppress the assembly of actin filaments in contractilering site. These findings indicate that PEG-GNR is a novel cytokinesis inhibitor which can be used to interfere with retinal angiogenesis and tumor.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Genotypes, phenotypes and treatment with immunomodulators in the rheumatic diseases.",/pubmed/29908080,"The autoimmune rheumatological diseases rheumatoid arthritis (RA),spondyloarthritis (SpA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are treated withconventional immunosuppressive agents and with modern biologicalimmunomodulators. The latter group of medications have brought about a majorchange in our ability to control RA and SpA, with more modest results for SLE.The biologicals are very specific in their mechanisms of action, targeting onespecific cytokine or one particular cellular marker. Because of this, theirefficacy can readily be linked to a single immunomodulatory mechanism. Thisobservation has fueled hopes that the efficacy of these agents can be predictedat the individual level based on the patient's genetic predisposition,immunological profile, or disease phenotype. While the biologic therapies haveimproved the prospects for patients with these disease very significantly, thehope that they could be targeted to the patient in an individualized manner hasnot competely born fruit. In this review I will argue that we are witnessingimportant progress in this field, and that justified hope exists for trueadvances in precision medicine in the autoimmune diseases in the coming years.This article is protected by copyright.

Randomized controlled trials of biologic treatment with methotrexate in RA may not reflect real world practice: A systematic review and assessment of pragmaticism.,/pubmed/29908014,"OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist along a spectrum, fromexplanatory, designed to evaluate interventions under ideal conditions, topragmatic, designed to reflect usual care. This study assessed the pragmaticismof RCTs of advanced therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify RA RCTs comparing biologicor targeted synthetic therapy in combination with methotrexate, to placebo or anyother DMARD(s). Trials were rated using the PRECIS-2 (PRagmatic ExplanatoryContinuum Indicator Summary-2) tool in 9 domains, each rated from 1 (veryexplanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic). Latent class and regression analyses examinedthe heterogeneity in PRECIS-2 scores and relationship to trial characteristics.RESULTS: 96 trials were included. Eligibility, follow-up, and flexibility ofdelivery of the intervention were rated as explanatory, with mean (SD) PRECIS-2scores of 2.0 (0.7), 2.0 (1.1), and 2.1 (0.7), reflecting strict inclusioncriteria, intensive follow-up and rigid protocols. Studies were rated aspragmatic in setting (3.6 (1.5)) as many were international, multi-centre trials,and in primary analysis (4.1 (1.3)) as most used intention-to-treat analyses. In latent class analyses, two groups were identified; the majority (74%) were rated as explanatory for most domains assessed. These trials had larger sample sizes,were more likely to be industry-funded, and enrolled patients with higher DAS-28 and HAQ-DI scores, but were less likely to be at high risk of bias.CONCLUSION: RCTs of biologic DMARD treatment in combination with methotrexate forRA were rated as predominantly explanatory, which may affect the generalizabilityof trial results to clinical practice.

Patient-Reported Disease Activity and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.,/pubmed/29908013,"OBJECTIVES: While increased rheumatic disease activity during pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, this activity is typically assessedby the physician. Little is known, however, about the association betweenpatient-reported measures of disease activity and pregnancy outcomes.METHODS: Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess therelationship between patient and physician-reported measures of disease activity and adverse pregnancy outcomes in 225 patients with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis(RA) enrolled in a prospective registry at a single academic center from2008-2016.RESULTS: In women with RA, patient-reported disease activity is associated withpreterm birth (OR 5.9 (1.5-23.9)), and gestational age (beta -1.5 weeks (-2.6,-0.4 weeks)). The physician assessment of disease activity also predicted preterm(OR 2.1 (1.2-3.5)), small for gestational age births (OR 1.8 (1.03-3.1), andgestational age in weeks (beta -0.6 weeks (-0.9, -0.02 weeks)). On the otherhand, SLE patient-reported disease activity measures, including the HAQ, pain or global health measures, are not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.However, physician measures of SLE disease activity are associated with pretermbirth (OR 2.9 (1.-6.3)), cesarean delivery (OR 2.3 (1.0-5.3)), and preeclampsia(OR 2.8 (1.3-6.3)). The results do not appear to be driven by lupus nephritis or antiphospholipid syndrome.CONCLUSIONS: For women with RA, patient-reported measures of disease activity maybe useful adjuncts to physician-reported measures in identifying pregnancies atgreater risk. In contrast, in SLE, no patient-reported measures were associatedwith adverse outcomes while physician measures of disease activity helped predictseveral adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Metabolite assignment of Ultra-Filtered Synovial Fluid extracted from knee joints of Reactive Arthritis patients using High Resolution NMR spectroscopy.,/pubmed/29907975,"Currently, there are no reliable clinical biomarkers available that can aid earlydifferential diagnosis of reactive arthritis (ReA) from other inflammatory joint diseases. Metabolic profiling of synovial fluid (SF) -obtained from jointsaffected in ReA- holds great promise in this regard and will further aidmonitoring treatment and improving our understanding about disease mechanism. As a first step in this direction, we report here the metabolite specific assignmentof 1 H and 13 C resonances detected in the NMR spectra of SF samples extractedfrom human patients with established ReA. The metabolite characterization hasbeen carried out on both normal as well as on ultra-filtered (deproteinized) SFsamples of eight ReA patients (n=8) using high resolution (800 MHz) 1 H and 1H-13 C NMR spectroscopy methods such as one-dimensional (1D) 1 H CPMG andtwo-dimensional (2D) J-resolved1 H NMR and homonuclear 1 H-1 H TOCSY andheteronuclear1 H-13 C HSQC correlation spectra. Compared to normal SF samples,several distinctive 1 H NMR signals were identified and assigned to metabolitesin the 1 H NMR spectra of ultra-filtered SF samples. Overall, we assigned 53metabolites in normal filtered SF and 64 metabolites in filtered pooled SF samplecompared to non-filtered SF samples for which only 48 metabolites (includinglipid/membrane metabolites as well) have been identified. The established NMRcharacterization of SF metabolites will serve to guide future metabolomicsstudies aiming to identify/evaluate the SF based metabolic biomarkers ofdiagnostic/prognostic potential or seeking biochemical insights into diseasemechanisms in a clinical perspective.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Recognition and control of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",/pubmed/29907885,"Absolute cardiovascular risk of an individual with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) isgreater when compared to the general population, and several factors have proven to be important for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in thesepatients, including factors related to the underlying disease, such as thesystemic inflammatory response, drugs used in its treatment, and a higherprevalence of traditional risk factors for CAD. Our aim is to describe therecognition and control frequencies of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH),dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM) in RA patients. Patients with RAanswered a questionnaire focused on their general knowledge of the risk factorsfor CAD, as well as on the recognition of the risk factors that they possess. Thepatient's information, collected from a structured medical record, was reviewedto evaluate the control of risk factors. Hundred and thirty-four patients wereincluded in the study. One patient was excluded due to the impossibility ofreviewing her medical records. Therefore, 133 patients remained in the study.Patients had a mean (SD) age of 57.3 (12.9) years. SAH was diagnosed in 88subjects, with a recognition frequency of 89.8%, and 63.3% had desirable bloodpressure control. Seventy-two patients were diagnosed with dyslipidemia; 68.1%recognized that they had dyslipidemia and 69.4% achieved desirable LDL-c control.Twenty-two patients had DM; 90.9% admitted being diabetic and 40.9% had desirableglycemic control.

Feasibility of Measurement and Adherence to System Performance Measures for Rheumatoid Arthritis in 5 Models of Care.,/pubmed/29907674,"OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of reporting on 4 national performancemeasures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 5 different models ofcare.METHODS: The following performance measures were evaluated in 5 models of care:waiting time (WT) to rheumatologist consultation, percentage of patients seen in yearly followup (FU), percentage taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs(DMARD), and time to starting DMARD. All models aimed to improve early access andcare for patients with RA.RESULTS: A number of feasibility issues were encountered in performance measureevaluation because of differences in site data collection and/or the duration of the model of care. For example, while 4/5 programs maintained clinical orresearch databases, chart reviews were still required to report on WT. Median WT for care in 2015 varied by site between 21 and 75 days. Yearly FU rates couldonly be calculated in 2 sites (combined owing to small numbers) and variedbetween 83% and 100%. Percentage of patients taking a DMARD and time to DMARDcould be calculated in 3 models, and rates of DMARD use were between 90% and100%, with median time to DMARD of 0 days in each.CONCLUSION: Our review has shown that even in models of care designed to improve access to care and early treatment, data to document improvements are oftenlacking. Where data were available for measuring, deficits in WT performance werenoted for some centers. Our results highlight a need to improve reportingprocesses to drive quality improvement.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sex-associated Treatment Differences and Their Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Results from the METEOR Register.,/pubmed/29907672,"OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in initial treatment and treatment response inmale and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in daily clinicalpractice.METHODS: The proportion of patients with RA starting different antirheumatictreatments (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; DMARD) and the response totreatment were compared in the international, observational METEOR register. All visits from start of the first DMARD until the first DMARD switch or the end offollowup were selected. The effect of sex on time to switch from first to second treatment was calculated using Cox regression. Linear mixed model analyses wereperformed to assess whether men and women responded differently to treatments, asmeasured by Disease Activity Score (DAS) or Health Assessment Questionnaire.RESULTS: Women (n = 4393) more often started treatment with hydroxychloroquine,as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or a glucocorticoid, andmen (n = 1142) more often started treatment with MTX and/or sulfasalazine. Timeto switch DMARD was shorter for women than for men. Women had a statisticallysignificantly higher DAS over time than men (DAS improvement per year _ -0.69,95% CI -0.75 to -0.62 for men and -0.58, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.55 for women).Subanalyses per DMARD group showed for the conventional synthetic DMARDcombination therapy a slightly greater decrease in DAS over time in men (-0.89,95% CI -1.07 to -0.71) compared to women (-0.59, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.51), butthese difference between the sexes were clinically negligible.CONCLUSION: This worldwide observational study suggests that in daily practice,men and women with RA are prescribed different initial treatments, but there wereno differences in response to treatment between the sexes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Methylglyoxal modified IgG generates autoimmune response in rheumatoid arthritis.,/pubmed/29906533,"The detection of autoantibodies generated against modified proteins thatstimulate cellular and humoral immune response has developed a lot of interest inthe recent years and a search for biomarkers for the early detection of diseases has increased. IgG protein has earned attention for its possible modificationsunder hyperglycaemic conditions in rheumatoid arthritis, wherein dicarbonylstress has been reported to alter the structural integrity of the protein. Thisreport suggests that the interaction of the methylglyoxal with the IgG hasconsequences in the autoimmunopathology of rheumatoid arthritis. Our moleculardocking analysis of methylglyoxal and IgG revealed a close interaction betweenthe two molecules. TNBS studies confirmed the interaction by showing a decline infree lysine-arginine content post-MG modifications in IgG. The modified IgG wasthermally more stable and showed the generation of glycation adductsN-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine. Rheumatoid arthritis patients showed enhancedcarbonyl stress which was expected to induce structural changes in the epitopemakeup of IgG. The ELISA studies and gel retardation assay confirmedauto-antibodies against MG modified IgG (MG-IgG) pointing towards the generation of neoepitopes upon IgG after interaction with MG. This study establishes the IgGmodification in RA patients under alter carbonyl concentrations.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed toexplore if increased circulating myeloid cells is associated with impairedatherosclerotic lesion regression or altered progression in RA.Methods and results: Using flow cytometry, we noted prominent monocytosis,neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis in two mouse models of RA. This was due toenhanced proliferation of the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) inthe bone marrow and the spleen. HSPCs expansion was associated with an increasein the cholesterol content, due to a down-regulation of cholesterol efflux genes,Apoe, Abca1, and Abcg1. The HSPCs also had enhanced expression of key myeloidpromoting growth factor receptors. Systemic inflammation was found to causedefective cellular cholesterol metabolism. Increased myeloid cells in mice withRA were associated with a significant impairment in lesion regression, eventhough cholesterol levels were equivalent to non-arthritic mice. Lesions fromarthritic mice exhibited a less stable phenotype as demonstrated by increasedimmune cell infiltration, lipid accumulation, and decreased collagen formation.In a progression model, we noted monocytosis, enhanced monocytes recruitment tolesions, and increased plaque macrophages. This was reversed with administration of reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL). Furthermore, RA patients haveexpanded CD16+ monocyte subsets and a down-regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1.Conclusion: Rheumatoid arthritis impairs atherosclerotic regression and altersprogression, which is associated with an expansion of myeloid cells and disturbedcellular cholesterol handling, independent of plasma cholesterol levels. Infusionof rHDL prevented enhanced myelopoiesis and monocyte entry into lesions.Targeting cellular cholesterol defects in people with RA, even if plasmacholesterol is within the normal range, may limit vascular disease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells in a rheumatoid arthritis rat model.,/pubmed/29905411,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of increased importance because of their capacity to counteract inflammation and suppress host immune responses.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of MSCs andhematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paw swelling was assessed by measuring the thickness of thehind paws using a caliper. Cytokines - interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosisfactor-alpha (TNF-_), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-_), and IL-10 - andrheumatoid factor (RF) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) kits. Oxidative stress biomarkers - malondialdehyde (MDA) and reducedglutathione (GSH) were assessed. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-_B) was detected bythe western blot technique. Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), matrixmetalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-1 (COMP-1)gene expression were assessed by the real-time quantitative analysis. Mesenchymalstem cells were isolated from the bone marrow (BM) of rats and HSCs were isolatedfrom human umbilical cord blood (UCB).RESULTS: Paw edema, RA score, RF, cytokine assay, antioxidant state, NF-_B,TLR-2, MMP3, and COMP-1 showed improvement in the group that received MSCscompared to the group that received HSCs and the group that receivedmethotrexate.CONCLUSIONS: Mesenchymal stem cells are very effective in reducing RAinflammation; they are superior to HSC and methotrexate treatment. Mesenchymalstem cells could become a better therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of Biqi capsule in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,/pubmed/29904406,"Biqi capsule is a Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation for treatingrheumatoid arthritis (RA), and clinical studies have indicatedthat its effect maybe more beneficial than that of Western medicine. The present study aimed toestimate the efficacy and safety of Biqi capsule alone or combined withmethotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX alone for treating RA by performing ameta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. Asystematic literature search of studies published until March 2017 was performed.References from relevant studies were screened to obtain additional articles. Theresults were independently evaluated for relevance, and full-text studies wereassessed for eligibility. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochranecollaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. Out of 558 citations that wereinitially retrieved, a total of 5 studies comprising 522 patients met theinclusion criteria. The risk of bias of these trials was generally unclear orhigh. Meta-analysis indicated that Biqi capsule had better effects on C-reactive protein [standardized mean difference (SMD), -7.05; 95% CI -(10.77-3.33)] andtender joint count [SMD, -3.02; 95% CI, -(3.81-2.22)] and fewer adverse effects(AEs) than MTX [relative risk (RR), 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.43]. Biqi capsule plusMTX was superior to MTX in terms of the total effect (RR, 1.17; 95% CI,1.06-1.28), rheumatoid factor [SMD, -12.54; 95% CI, -(16.87-8.20)], swollen jointcount [SMD, -1.50; 95% CI, -(1.99-1.01)], score of joint swelling [SMD -2.07; 95%CI, -(2.76-1.38)], tender joint count [SMD, -2.16; 95% CI, -(2.86-1.47)] andscore of joint tenderness [SMD, -4.69; 95% CI, -(5.92-3.47)]. There was nodifference in AEs between Biqi capsule plus MTX and MTX (RR, 0.71; 95% CI,0.34-1.50). In conclusion, the present study indicated that compared with MTX,Biqi capsule plus MTX appeared to have more benefits but that Biqi capsule alone was not better for RA patients than MTX. In the other words, Biqi capsule plusMTX is more effective and has fewer AEs compared to MTX. However, the trialsselected in the present meta-analysis have various limitations, including thelack of blinding and the short duration of the treatment; therefore, theconclusions are not sufficiently definitive. More randomized controlled trialsare necessary to evaluate the use of Biqi capsule for managing RA.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Disease Activity Score 28-joint counterythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) decreased from 5.0 to 2.9 after 24months (p<0.0001) in patients with RA, and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis DiseaseIndex score decreased from 5.1 to 2.4 (p<0.0001) in patients with AS. Responserate calculated in patients with PsA by modified Psoriatic Arthritis ResponseCriteria was 67.9% after 24 months. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate nature, and no new safety signals were detected. According to the physicians'clinical assessments, treatment with GLM was successful (no adverse drug reactionand a clear or moderate therapeutic effect in an individual patient) in55.0%-56.6% of patients with RA, PsA and AS, respectively, at month 3, increasingfrom 74.5% to 76.1% at month 24.CONCLUSIONS: GLM subcutaneously once monthly led to substantial improvements inclinical effectiveness in patients with various inflammatory rheumatic diseaseswho could be followed up in a real-life setting in Germany. The treatment waswell tolerated, and the safety profile of GLM was consistent with that observedin the previous randomised controlled trials.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01313858.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,

"Kampo, A Japanese Traditional Medicinal System for Psychiatric Conditions: A Narrative Review.",/pubmed/29940662,"INTRODUCTION: Kampo is a Japanese traditional medicinal system and is representedby unity of mind and body. It is originally based upon Chinese traditionalmedicine but has uniquely developed in Japan.METHODS: A narrative review on the use of Kampo for psychiatric conditions isprovided.RESULTS: Kampo formula is a combination of several crude ingredients; most derivefrom natural plants and some from animals and minerals. These Kampo formulae are widely prescribed in almost all medical disciplines, including psychiatry, inJapan; they have been used for various psychiatric disorders such as dementia,schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, andpersonality disorders. Kampo is a versatile traditional medicine with a varietyof positive effects on mental states with relatively benign side effect profiles.Kampo formulae can be adjunctively combined with or substituted for the Westernpsychotropic drugs, which will provide more treatment options to patients withpsychiatric conditions.DISCUSSION: This review summarizes the current knowledge on Kampo for psychiatricconditions, highlighting a paucity of data and a need for further good-qualityevidence on these medications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Aldosterone and aldosterone/cortisol ratio is higher in serum of long-term compared to first episode schizophrenia patients: A pilot study.,/pubmed/29940461,"We have previously shown that patients with severe depressive episode exhibithigher aldosterone concentrations compared to those with moderate depressiveepisode. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that circulatingconcentration of aldosterone reflect the clinical state in patients withschizophrenia. The sample consisted of 36 hospitalized patients (25 men, 11women) with the first episode or long-term course of schizophrenia. The severity of psychopathology was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS). Samples for measurement of serum aldosterone were obtained immediatelyafter awakening. The results showed that serum aldosterone concentrations werelower in patients with the first episode compared to those in patients withlong-term course of schizophrenia. Importantly, lower aldosterone concentrations observed in patients with the first episode were associated with more severeclinical symptoms as indicated by all subscales of PANSS. Serum cortisolconcentrations did not differ between the groups, while the aldosterone/cortisol ratio showed similar pattern as aldosterone concentrations. The present pilotstudy suggests that circulating aldosterone in patients with schizophrenia mayreflect the severity of clinical symptoms but in an opposite direction than inpatients with major depressive disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Premorbid adjustment predictors of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29940456,"Premorbid adjustment (PA) in academic and social domain is a key-predictor ofcognitive performance in schizophrenia. Prior studies provided inconsistentfindings regarding the differential relationships of PA domains with post-illnesscognition. Multivariate associations of academic and social PA in eachdevelopmental stage (childhood, early and late adolescence) with post-onsetcognitive variables were explored. Furthermore, possible differentialrelationships of PA domain deterioration courses with post-onset cognitivedysfunction were investigated. Seventy-five schizophrenia patients were evaluatedwith Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). General cognitive ability, verbal IQ,verbal memory and learning, processing speed, working memory, executive function and premorbid IQ were assessed. Canonical Correlation Analyses revealed thatpoorer academic PA across childhood and early adolescence was related to worsepost-onset verbal IQ, working memory, verbal learning and executive function,while academic PA deterioration between early and late adolescence was associatedwith poorer verbal learning and executive function and, as further analysisindicated, predicts IQ decline. Academic PA was exclusively associated withpost-onset cognitive impairment. New evidence emerged for the specificity of eachdevelopmental period in constructing academic PA in its relation to post-illness cognition. Early premorbid academic maladjustment possibly constitutes the onset of a cognitive dysmaturational process which results to post-diagnosis impairedcognition.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Overview of the clinical implementation of a study exploring social withdrawal in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.,/pubmed/29940238,"Trans-diagnostic, domain- or symptom-focused approaches have been heralded asadvancing psychiatric research, but relatively few clinical research programmeshave been undertaken to leverage their potential. In this manuscript we describe the approach and protocol for an exploratory study, PRISM (Psychiatric Ratingsusing Intermediate Stratified Markers), that will be conducted to explore thebiomarkers in schizophrenia (SZ) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may be relatedto a common symptom, social withdrawal. Patient participants (N_=_72 SZ andN_=_72 AD study completers), will complete a series of fMRI, EEG, and behaviouralparadigms, as well as contributing blood-derived (e.g. epigenetic) and smartphonedata related to social behaviour. Self- as well as caregiver- andresearcher-reported assessments will be provided to characterise socialwithdrawal. Normative data will also be collected from a group of healthycontrols (N_=_48 study completers), half of whom will be matched in terms of age and gender distribution to the SZ and AD group, respectively. Thus we willexplore both differentiation and cross-diagnostic overlap in the biomarkersassociated with different levels of social withdrawal in SZ and AD. In this waywe aim to provide a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings ofsymptomatology common to both disorders, and provide insights into noveltreatment targets and future drug development approaches.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Efficacy of PRIME, a Mobile App Intervention Designed to Improve Motivation in Young People With Schizophrenia.",/pubmed/29939367,"The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development ofsocial relationships and functional independence. As such, interventions thattarget the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functionaldecline and restore functioning to pre-illness levels.

Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) ortreatment-as-usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessmentsat baseline, post-trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks, WL participants received PRIME,resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME,participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtualcommunity of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well asmotivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME conditionhad significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression, defeatistbeliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptomspost-trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end oftrial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greaterimprovements in components of social motivation post-trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure).

The Multiple Dimensions of Insight in Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders.,/pubmed/29939361,"The concept of insight is used to indicate the propensity of patients withschizophrenia and other severe mental disorders to recognize their illness andengage in treatment. Thus, insight may have notable consequences for the illindividual: Those who lack insight are at higher risk of nonadherence totreatments, negative clinical outcomes, and worse community functioning. Althoughinsight is an intuitive concept, its essence remains difficult to capture.However, many rating scales are available to aid assessment, both for clinicaland research purposes. Insight cannot be reduced to a symptom, a psychologicalmechanism, or a neuropsychological function. It is likely to have dynamicrelationships with all these dimensions and with responses to personal events andcontextual factors. In particular, social consequences of mental illness andexplanatory models that are alternative to the medical model may fundamentallyshape insight and treatment choice. Moreover, the cultural or individualstigmatization of mental illness may turn the acquisition of insight into apainful event and increase the risk of depression. Clinicians need to carefullyevaluate and promote insight through a personalized approach to aid patientprocess of care and personal growth.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Brain Connectivity Deviates by Sex and Hemisphere in the First Episode of Schizophrenia""-A Route to the Genetic Basis of Language and Psychosis?",/pubmed/29939349,"Schizophrenia is genetic in origin and associated with a fecundity disadvantage. The deficits in schizophrenia have been attributed to variation related to thehuman capacity for language or brain laterality. How sex influences the relative connectivity of the 2 hemispheres is a route to understanding these 2 functions. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we searched for sex- and hemisphere-specific changes in whole-brain functional-connectivity inmulti-site datasets (altogether 672 subjects including 286 patients, allright-handed) in the first-episode schizophrenia (illness duration ² 1 year,mostly drug naive) and in chronic stages of schizophrenia (illness duration > 1year), respectively. We used meta-analyses to integrate data from differentsources concerning individuals at the same illness stage. We found first-episode male patients are predominantly left-lateralized in aberrant connectivity with a focus on Broca's area. Female patients show a lesser degree of lateralizationthan males, but to the right particularly in orbital frontal cortex. In thechronic stage, the focus of aberrant connectivity shifted from anterior toposterior structures with prominent involvement of the thalamus and pre- andpost-central gyri bilaterally and in both sexes. While the ""deviant connectivity""is right-sided in both the first-episode and the chronic stages in females, inmales there is a shift between stages from the left to the right hemisphere. Wehypothesized that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia may lie in the interactionbetween sex and lateralization, ie, in genetic mechanisms located on the X and Y chromosomes, intrinsic to the evolution of language.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Disconnected and Hyperactive: A Replication of Sensorimotor Cortex Abnormalities in Patients With Schizophrenia During Proactive Response Inhibition.,/pubmed/29939338,"Inhibitory failure represents a core dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia(SP), which has predominantly been tested in the literature using reactive (ie,altering behavior after a stimulus) rather than proactive (ie, purposefullychanging behavior before a stimulus) response inhibition tasks. The current studyreplicates/extends our previous findings of SP exhibiting sensorimotor cortex(SMC) hyperactivity and connectivity abnormalities in independent samples ofpatients and controls. Specifically, 49 clinically well-characterized SP and 54matched healthy controls (HC) performed a proactive response inhibition taskwhile undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state datacollection. Results indicated that the majority of SP (84%) and HC (88%)successfully inhibited all overt motor responses following a cue, eliminatingbehavioral confounds frequently present in this population. Observations of left SMC hyperactivity during proactive response inhibition, reduced corticalconnectivity with left SMC, and increased connectivity between left SMC andventrolateral thalamus were replicated for SP relative to HC in the currentstudy. Similarly, negative symptoms (eg, motor retardation) were again associatedwith SMC functional and connectivity abnormalities. In contrast, findings of anegative blood oxygenation level-dependent response in the SMC of HC did notreplicate. Collectively, current and previous findings suggest that SMCconnectivity abnormalities may be more robust relative to evoked hemodynamicsignals during proactive response inhibition. In addition, there is strongsupport that these SMC abnormalities are a key component of SP pathology, alongwith dysfunction within other sensory cortices, and may be associated withcertain clinical deficits such as negative symptoms.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Examining the reliability and factor structure of the Malay version of the Recovery Self-Assessment in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29939040,"OBJECTIVE: Without a reliable and valid tool, it is neither possible to gaugerecovery orientation of persons with serious mental illness nor to evaluatewhether existing mental health system encourages recovery in both its policiesand current practice in Malaysia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examinethe reliability and factor structure of the Malay version of the RecoverySelf-Assessment (RSA-PIRV-M) in a psychiatric sample.METHOD: Psychiatric patients were eligible for recruitment to the study, whenthey fulfilled the following criteria: a diagnosis of schizophrenia, were agedbetween 18- and 65-years-old, and were able to give consent themselves. Werecruited 118 individuals with schizophrenia. They were selected via systematicrandom sampling technique. All RSA-PIRV-M items were derived from the parentscale. These items were translated based on established procedures. Thereliability estimates of the RSA-PIRV-M were based on Cronbach's alpha. Weperformed confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure of theRSA-PIRV-M.RESULTS: All Cronbach's alphas for the RSA-PIRV-M subscales were at least .70.With respect to the factor structure of the RSA-PIRV-M, our structural equationmodeling findings suggest a five-factor model encompassing life goals,involvement, diversity of treatment options, choice, and individually-tailoredservices.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The interpretation of our findings is limited by small sample size, unique sample characteristics, and lack of further evidence for convergent validity. Notwithstanding these limitations, theRSA-PIRV-M is a promising tool in bridging gaps between our knowledge on recoveryorientation and existing mental health service provision in Malaysia.

Atypical Antipsychotic Administration in Schizophrenic Patients Leads to Elevated Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 Levels and Increased Cardiovascular Risk: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,/pubmed/29938908,"The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is higher in patients withschizophrenia than in the general population. We aimed to investigate whetheratypical antipsychotics (AAP) increase the levels of lipoprotein-associatedphospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), thereby increasing the risk of CVD. The data werefrom inpatients aged 18 to 60 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia accordingto ICD-10 at The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University whounderwent physical examination between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2016. Aretrospective cohort study was used to analyse the correlation between AAP andLp-PLA2 levels, the CVD risk (it was determined that Lp-PLA2 values > 200 ng/mLwas high CVD risk) in patients treated with monotherapy olanzapine, clozapine or quetiapine. Data were collected for 452 patients with eligible schizophrenia: 163treated with clozapine, 186 treated with olanzapine, 47 treated with quetiapineand 56 receiving no medication. Compared with the no-medication patients, AAPadministration patients with olanzapine, clozapine or quetiapine had higher serumLp-PLA2 levels when age, sex, BMI and fasting glucose level were matched. AAP wassignificantly associated with serum Lp-PLA2 level by Spearman correlationcoefficients. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that AAPadministration was an independent factor of CVD risk when adjusted by potentialconfounding factors. This study is the first to confirm that AAP administration, especially clozapine and olanzapine, could increase Lp-PLA2 levels and CVD risk, independent from drug-induced weight gain in schizophrenia. The extent and thefactors of increasing Lp-PLA2 level and CVD risk in olanzapine, clozapine andquetiapine are discrepant. The possible effects of atypical antipsychotics onLp-PLA2 in schizophrenia patients are involved in pro-inflammatory cytokines and hormones. This article is protected by copyright.

An Experimental Investigation into the Effect of State-Anxiety on State-Paranoia in People Experiencing Psychosis.,/pubmed/29938626,"BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence to suggest that anxiety is associated withparanoia in clinical and non-clinical samples. However, no research to date hasdirectly manipulated anxiety to investigate if state-anxiety has a causal role instate-paranoia in clinical populations.AIMS: To investigate whether an anxious-mood induction leads to greater paranoia than a neutral-mood induction in people experiencing psychosis and paranoia and, if so, whether this is predicted by anxiety over and above other variables.METHOD: 22 participants with a psychosis-spectrum diagnosis took part in a twocondition cross-over experimental design. Participants underwent a neutral-moodand an anxious-mood induction with levels of state-anxiety, state-affect andstate-paranoia being measured before and after each condition.RESULTS: State-paranoia was significantly higher after the anxious conditioncompared with the neutral condition. State-anxiety and negative-affect weresignificant predictors of levels of state-paranoia after the anxious condition.When both predictors were included in a regression model, only negative-affectwas a significant predictor of state-paranoia after the anxious condition. There were a number of methodological limitations.CONCLUSIONS: State-anxiety and negative-affect may both be involved in themaintenance of paranoia in clinical populations, as predicted by cognitivemodels. Negative-affect may be the strongest predictor of state-paranoia inclinical populations. Reasons for this are discussed, as well as theimplications. Interventions that seek to reduce negative state-affect may bebeneficial in managing state-paranoia. Further research is warranted to explorethe suggested clinical and theoretical implications of these findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Plasma and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and their association with neurocognition in at-risk mental state, first episode psychosis and chronic schizophrenia patients.",/pubmed/29938562,"OBJECTIVES: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in numerouscognitive processes. Since cognitive deficits are a core feature of psychoticdisorders, the investigation of BDNF levels in psychosis and their correlationwith cognition has received increased attention. However, there are no studiesinvestigating BDNF levels in individuals with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Hence, the aims of the present study were: (1) assessing peripheralBDNF levels across different (potential) stages of psychosis; (2) investigatingtheir association with cognition.METHODS: Plasma and serum BDNF levels and neuropsychological performance wereassessed in 16 ARMS, six first-episode psychosis (FEP), and 11 chronicschizophrenia (CS) patients. Neuropsychological assessment covered intelligence, verbal memory, working memory, attention and executive functioning.RESULTS: Both plasma and serum BDNF levels were highest in CS, intermediate inFEP and lowest in ARMS. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significantpositive association of plasma BDNF levels with planning ability across allgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The lower peripheral BDNF levels in ARMS compared to FEP and CSmight point towards an important drop of this neurotrophin prior to the onset of frank psychosis. The associations of peripheral BDNF with planning-abilitiesmatch previous findings.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Community-Based Psychosocial Treatment Has an Impact on Social Processing and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29937739,"Schizophrenic patients have serious impairments in social cognition, which often persists after significant reduction in clinical symptoms. Community-basedpsychosocial treatments aim to recover social functioning for mentally illindividuals. Our aim was to examine prospective changes in social cognition andfunctional outcomes in two groups of schizophrenic patients involved in two formsof community-based psychosocial treatments namely case management (CM) andcommunity-based club (CC) compared to a matched, treatment as usual (TAU) groupof patients. We hypothesized that CC and CM groups would exhibit betterfunctional and social cognitive outcomes after a 6-month long psychosocialtreatment period. Seventy-five patients participated either in CC, CM or TAU.Both CC and CM took part in community-based psychosocial treatment programsincluding trainings, such as communication and assertiveness trainings. Inaddition, CC provided group therapeutic treatments and a continuously availableday care where patients had the possibility to participate in various socialinteractions. All participants were in remission, and on maintenanceantipsychotic treatment. Participants were assessed on all study variables at twotime points: baseline and after 6 months with a battery of questionnaires thatexamined affective face perception, affective prosody perception, pragmaticlanguage comprehension and ToM. Our results showed that functional outcomesimproved significantly in the CC as well as in the CM groups, in contrast to the TAU group. While analyzing summary scores of social cognition, it was found that only the CC group increased its performance in social cognition. In addition, asignificant between-group difference in social cognitive function was found after6 months between the three groups, with the CC group performing best. Wheninvestigating associations between changes in social cognition and changes infunctional outcomes during a 6-month long treatment period, we found significant correlations between the two variables both in the CC and in the CM groups. Basedon our results, we suggest that a rich interpersonal network and social supporthave highly beneficial effects on social cognition and we would like to emphasizethe necessity of offering community-based psychosocial treatments besideantipsychotic medications as early as possible as a crucial part of the complextherapy of schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Social aversive conditioning in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis and with psychosis: An ERP study.,/pubmed/29937326,"BACKGROUND: Social cognition and emotion processing are compromised inschizophrenia. Disruptions in these domains may also be present during thepsychosis-risk state. Aversive conditioning is an established translationalresearch paradigm to investigate affective reactivity and learning. Using anaversive conditioning ERP paradigm with social cues, we examined whetherpsychosis patients and at-risk youths differentially respond to aversivelyconditioned faces.METHODS: Participants (ages 10-30) were enrolled into threedemographically-matched groups: clinical risk for psychosis (CR, n_=_32),psychosis (PS, n_=_26), and healthy control (HC, n_=_33). EEGs were recordedduring a delay aversive conditioning task in which three neutral faces werepaired with an aversive tone at 100%, 50% and 0% contingencies. Analysis focused on group differences in ERP peaks representing visual processing (occipitalP120), emotional valence (frontal VPP), and directed attention(parietal-occipital P300), for dimensions of aversiveness (100% vs. 0%) andunpredictability (50% vs. 100%_+_0%).RESULTS: HC, but not CR or PS, showed increased P300 amplitude to aversive vs.non-aversive conditioned stimuli. CR, but not PS or HC, showed increased VPPamplitude to unpredictable vs. predictable stimuli.CONCLUSIONS: PS and CR both fail to allocate appropriate salience to social cues that are predictably aversive. CR, but not PS exhibit heightened emotionalreactivity to social cues that are of uncertain salience. Clinical risk forschizophrenia may involve neural abnormalities distinct from both healthy andfully-established disease states.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cognitive deterioration in schizophrenia: aging and cerebrovascular disease.,/pubmed/29936917,"Today, cognitive dysfunction is accepted as a feature of schizophrenia.

Prospective memory in clinical populations.,/pubmed/29936902,"OBJECTIVE: Prospective memory (PM) has emerged as a form of episodic memory that is frequently impaired in a variety of clinical populations. Neuropsychologistswho routinely evaluate these populations are often unaware of the possibility of PM deficits or the impact these deficits may have on everyday functioning. Theobjective of this special issue is to provide an overview of the nature ofprospective deficits in a range of clinical populations, to discussneuropsychological assessment techniques, and to critically evaluate managementstrategies.METHOD: We solicited papers from established researchers and issued a generalcall for papers for the special issue on PM in clinical populations.RESULTS: We received submissions from the nine authors that we solicited. Thesesubmissions range from developmental disorders, including autism, attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia; to disorders of adulthood, such as schizophrenia, HIV, brain injury, and multiple sclerosis; and finally disordersthat tend to occur at older ages, such as Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment. In addition, we have included four original research articles thatprovide novel data on other populations. These are children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia,individuals with mild brain injury, and individuals with idiopathic REM sleepbehavioral disorder.CONCLUSIONS: The issue highlights the need for clinical neuropsychologists to be aware of the possible existence of deficits in PM in a variety of clinicalpopulations and the importance of both assessment and management strategies toreduce the impact on daily life.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Community pharmacists' attitudes and opinions towards supplying clozapine.,/pubmed/29936642,"Background Clozapine is very effective for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, butits use has been limited due to the risk of agranulocytosis. From July 2015,clozapine has been accessible from Australian community pharmacies followingregulatory changes, but pharmacists' attitudes towards these changes remainunknown. Objective To explore pharmacists' perspectives and experiences insupplying clozapine. Setting Australian community pharmacists. Methods Across-sectional study with a mixed methods approach involving two phases. Anonline survey containing Likert-type and open-response questions was distributed to community pharmacists (n_=_134) via ClopineCentralª (clozapine monitoringsystem). Participants were then invited to participate in semi-structuredtelephone interviews (n_=_12) regarding clozapine supply. Quantitative data were statistically analysed, while qualitative responses were thematicallycontent-analysed. Main outcome measures Pharmacists' responses to surveys andinterviews. Results Community pharmacists were supportive towards supplyingclozapine as it increased access for consumers. Better patient-pharmacistrelationships and holistic care approach were identified to benefit bothconsumers and pharmacists. Pharmacists reported to be confident (89.6%), haveadequate support (73.1%), knowledge (86.6%) and skills (93.3%) in dispensingclozapine. Training and support received facilitated pharmacists' roles, whereas administrative issues, especially in obtaining valid haematology results, posedchallenges. Educational and technical improvements were suggested to improveservice provision. Conclusion Community pharmacists welcomed the regulatorychanges positively and were confident in supporting consumers taking clozapine.Despite challenges present, benefits and facilitators identified supported thefeasibility of this service in community pharmacies. Future research shouldexplore other aspects of clozapine supply, such as attitudes of otherstakeholders, to improve current supply systems.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Community pharmacists' experiences and people at risk of suicide in Canada and Australia: a thematic analysis.,/pubmed/29936597,"PURPOSE: To explore Canadian and Australian community pharmacists' practiceexperiences in caring for people at risk of suicide.METHODS: We conducted a thematic analysis of 176 responses to an open-endedextension question in an online survey.RESULTS: Four themes were identified and include referrals and triage,accessibility for confiding, emotional toll, and stigma. Subthemes includedgatekeeping the medication supply, sole disclosure, planning for end of life,concerns of support people, assessing the validity of suicidality, gaps in thesystem, not directly asking, ill-equipped, resources in the pharmacy, relying on others to continue care, and attention seeking.CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacists are caring for patients at risk of suicidefrequently, and often with patients seeking the help of pharmacists directly.Pharmacists engage in activities and actions that would be considered outside of the traditional dispensing roles and provide support and intervention to peopleat risk of suicide through collaboration and other mechanisms. Further researchto determine appropriate education and training and postvention supports isrequired.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Chronic Adolescent CDPPB Treatment Alters Short-Term, but not Long-Term, Glutamatergic Receptor Expression.",/pubmed/29936568,"Dysfunction of the glutamatergic system is believed to underlie manyneurodevelopmental disorders including autism, Rett syndrome and schizophrenia.Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) positive allosteric modulators (PAM)potentiate glutamatergic signaling, particularly indirectly via the NMDAreceptor. Preclinical studies report mGluR5 PAMs can improveschizophrenia-relevant behaviours. Furthermore, adolescent administration hasshown to prevent cognitive induced deficits in adult rodents. However, there islimited understanding of the short- and long-term neurochemical effects of mGluR5PAMs, which may underlie their therapeutic effects. We examined the effect of7-day adolescent (PN28-34) treatment with the mGluR5 PAM, CDDPB (30Êmg/kg), onglutamatergic receptor expression at adolescence (PN35) and adulthood (PN96).Immunoblot analysis revealed that 7-day adolescent CDPPB treatment increasedprotein expression of glutamatergic receptors including the NMDA receptorsubunits, NR1 and NR2A and the AMPA subunits (GluA1 and GluA2) in the adolescent hippocampus, changes that did not extend to adulthood. In contrast, there were nochanges in the adolescent frontal cortex, however elevated mGluR5 proteinexpression was observed at adulthood following adolescent CDPPB treatment. Thepresent study indicates adolescent CDPPB treatment may cause brain regiondependent effects on the glutamatergic system, which do not persist intoadulthood. These findings may have implications for the preclinical developmentof mGluR5 PAMs for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Association Between Population Density and Genetic Risk for Schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29936532,"Importance: Urban life has been proposed as an environmental risk factoraccounting for the increased prevalence of schizophrenia in urban areas. Analternative hypothesis is that individuals with increased genetic risk tend tolive in urban/dense areas.Objective: To assess whether adults with higher genetic risk for schizophreniahave an increased probability to live in more populated areas than those withlower risk.Design, Setting, and Participants: Four large, cross-sectional samples ofgenotyped individuals of European ancestry older than 18 years with knownaddresses in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands were included in the analysis. Data were based on the postcode of residence at the time of lastcontact with the participants. Community-based samples who took part in studiesconducted by the Queensland Institute for Medical Research Berghofer MedicalResearch Institute (QIMR), UK Biobank (UKB), Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), or QSkin Sun and Health Study (QSKIN) were included. Genome-wide associationanalysis and mendelian randomization (MR) were included. The study was conducted between 2016 and 2018.Exposures: Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia derived from genetic data(genetic risk is independently measured from the occurrence of the disease).Socioeconomic status of the area was included as a moderator in some of themodels.Main Outcomes and Measures: Population density of the place of residence of theparticipants determined from census data. Remoteness and socioeconomic status of the area were also tested.Results: The QIMR participants (15_544; 10_197 [65.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 54.4[13.2] years) living in more densely populated areas (people per squarekilometer) had a higher genetic loading for schizophrenia (r2_=_0.12%;P_=_5.69___10-5), a result that was replicated across all 3 other cohorts (UKB:345_246; 187_469 [54.3%] women; age, 65.7 [8.0] years; NTR: 11_212; 6727 [60.0%] women; age, 48.6 [17.5] years; and QSKIN: 15_726; 8602 [54.7%] women; age, 57.0[7.9] years). This genetic association could account for 1.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.2%)of the schizophrenia risk. Estimates from MR analyses performed in the UKB samplewere significant (b_=_0.049; P_=_3.7___10-7 using GSMR), suggesting that thegenetic liability to schizophrenia may have a causal association with thetendency to live in urbanized locations.Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study appear to support thehypothesis that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live inurban/dense areas and suggest the need to refine the social stress model forschizophrenia by including genetics as well as possible gene-environmentinteractions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Alterations in cortical interneurons and cognitive function in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29936230,"Certain clinical features of schizophrenia, such as working memory disturbances, appear to emerge from altered gamma oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex(PFC). Given the essential role of GABA neurotransmission in both working memory and gamma oscillations, understanding the cellular substrate for theirdisturbances in schizophrenia requires evidence from in vivo neuroimagingstudies, which provide a means to link markers of GABA neurotransmission to gammaoscillations and working memory, and from postmortem studies, which provideinsight into GABA neurotransmission at molecular and cellular levels ofresolution. Here, we review findings from both types of studies which converge onthe notions that 1) inhibitory GABA signaling in the PFC, especially betweenparvalbumin positive GABAergic basket cells and excitatory pyramidal cells, isrequired for gamma oscillatory activity and working memory function; and 2)disturbances in this signaling contribute to altered gamma oscillations andworking memory in schizophrenia. Because the PFC is only one node in adistributed cortical network that mediates working memory, we also reviewevidence of GABA abnormalities in other cortical regions in schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A positive take on schizophrenia negative symptom scales: Converting scores between the SANS, NSA and SDS.",/pubmed/29935887,"AIMS: To provide quantitative conversions between commonly used scales for theassessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.METHOD: Linear regression analyses generated conversion equations between symptomscores from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), theSchedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS), or the Negative Symptoms Assessment (NSA) based on a cross sectionalsample of 176 individuals with schizophrenia. Intraclass correlations assessedthe rating conversion accuracy based on a separate sub-sample of 29 patients who took part in the initial study as well as an independent sample of 28 additional subjects with schizophrenia.RESULTS: Between-scale negative symptom ratings were moderately to highlycorrelated (r_=_0.73-0.91). Intraclass correlations between the original negativesymptom rating scores and those obtained via using the conversion equations were in the range of 0.61-0.79.CONCLUSIONS: While there is a degree of non-overlap, several negative symptomsscores reflect measures of similar constructs and may be reliably convertedbetween some scales.

Low plasma concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits as a possible biomarker for psychosis.,/pubmed/29935886,"BACKGROUND: N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been largely implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other psychosis. Aiming to evaluate theirpotential as peripheral biomarkers for psychosis, we quantified the plasmaconcentrations of NR1 and NR2 NMDAR subunits of first-episode psychosis patients in their first contact with mental health services due to psychotic symptoms,compared with siblings and matched community-based controls.METHODS: The quantifications of NR1 and NR2 plasma concentrations were performed by ELISA. Data were analysed by nonparametric tests and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: We included 166 first-episode psychosis patients (meanage_=_30.3_±_12.2_years; 64% men), with the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum(n_=_84), bipolar disorder (n_=_51) and psychotic depression (n_=_31), 76siblings (mean age_=_31.5_±_11.0_years; 30.3% men) and 166 healthycommunity-based controls (mean age_=_31.4_±_12.0_years; 63.9% men). NMDARsubunits were significantly lower in patients compared with siblings and controls(p_<_0.001), except by NR1 plasma concentrations of bipolar patients comparedwith siblings and controls. NR1 plasma concentrations lower than 17.65_pg/ml(AUC_=_0.621) showed sensitivity of 42.8%, specificity of 84.3%, positivepredictive value (PPV) of 73.2% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 59.6%.Individuals with NR2 plasma concentrations lower than 2.92_ng/ml (AUC_=_0.801)presented a 10.61-fold increased risk of psychosis, with a sensibility of 71.9%, specificity of 80.6%, PPV of 79.0% and NPV of 73.9%.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the measurement and the reduction of NR1 and NR2 NMDAR subunits plasma concentrations in psychiatric disorders. In particular, the NR2 subunit may be a possible plasma biomarker for psychosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Service utilization and suicide among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.,/pubmed/29935885,"OBJECTIVE: To compare individuals with and without schizophrenia spectrumdisorders (SSD) (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disordernot otherwise specified) who die by suicide.METHOD: This is a retrospective case control study which compared all individualswho died by suicide in Ontario, Canada with (cases) and without (controls) SSDbetween January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. Cases (individuals with SSD) were compared to controls on demographics, clinical characteristics, and healthservice utilization proximal to suicide. A secondary analysis compared thecharacteristics of those with SSD and those with severe mental illness (definedas those without SSD who have had a psychiatric hospitalization within thefive-years before suicide (excluding the 30_days prior to death)).RESULTS: Among 5650 suicides, 663 (11.7%) were by individuals with SSD. Compared to other suicides, SSD suicides were significantly more likely to be between the ages of 25-34. SSD suicide victims were significantly more likely to reside inthe lowest income neighbourhoods and to reside in urban areas. SSD victims werealso significantly more likely to have comorbid mood and personality disordersand all types of health service utilization, including outpatient mental healthservice contact in the 30_days prior to death, even when compared only with thosewho had a history of mental health hospitalization.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder account for over 1 in 10 suicide deaths, tend to be younger, poorer, urban, more clinically complex,and have higher rates of mental health service contact prior to death. Thedemographic and service utilization differences persist even when the SSD groupis compared with a population with severe mental illness that is not SSD. Suicideprevention strategies for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder shouldemphasize the importance of clinical suicide risk assessment during clinicalencounters, particularly early in the course of illness.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The impact of intrinsic motivation on session attendance and reliable cognitive improvement in cognitive remediation in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29935884,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive remediation (CR) is considered a potentially effectivemethod of improving cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. Few studies,however, have explored the role of intrinsic motivation on treatment utilization or training outcomes in CR in this population. This study explored the impact of task-specific intrinsic motivation on attendance and reliable cognitiveimprovement in a controlled trial comparing CR with a computer game (CG) playing control.METHODS: Forty-nine participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, allocated to 10_weeks of group-based CR (n_=_25) or CG control (n_=_24), providedcomplete outcome data at baseline. Forty-three participants completed theirassigned intervention. Cognition, psychopathology and intrinsic motivation weremeasured at baseline and end-treatment. Regression analyses explored the relativecontribution of baseline motivation and other clinical factors to sessionattendance as well as the association of baseline and change in intrinsicmotivation with the odds of reliable cognitive improvement (calculated usingreliable change indices).RESULTS: Baseline reports of perceived program value were the only significantmultivariable predictor of session attendance when including global cognition andpsychiatric symptomatology. The odds of reliable cognitive improvementsignificantly increased with greater improvements in program interest and valuefrom baseline to end-treatment. Motivational changes over time were highlyvariable between participants.CONCLUSION: Task-specific intrinsic motivation in schizophrenia may represent an important patient-related factor that contributes to session attendance andcognitive improvements in CR. Regular evaluation and enhancement of intrinsicmotivation in cognitively enhancing interventions may optimize treatmentengagement and the likelihood of meaningful training outcomes.",RCT,,,,Group based cognitive remediation,Computer game control,,,Schizophrenia,"Cognition, psychopathology, and intrinsic motivation",
Tractography-based classification in distinguishing patients with first-episode schizophrenia from healthy individuals.,/pubmed/29935206,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has been characterized as a neurodevelopmental disorderof brain disconnectivity. However, whether disrupted integrity of white mattertracts in schizophrenia can potentially serve as individual discriminativebiomarkers remains unclear.METHODS: A random forest algorithm was applied to tractography-based diffusionproperties obtained from a cohort of 65 patients with first-episode schizophrenia(FES) and 60 healthy individuals to investigate the machine-learningdiscriminative power of white matter disconnectivity. Recursive featureelimination was used to select the ultimate white matter features in theclassification. Relationships between algorithm-predicted probabilities andclinical characteristics were also examined in the FES group.RESULTS: The classifier was trained by 80% of the sample. Patients weredistinguished from healthy individuals with an overall accuracy of 71.0% (95%confident interval: 61.1%, 79.6%), a sensitivity of 67.3%, a specificity of75.0%, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 79.3%(_2 p_<_0.001). In validation using the held-up 20% of the sample, patients were distinguished from healthy individuals with an overall accuracy of 76.0% (95%confident interval: 54.9%, 90.6%), a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of75.0%, and an AUC of 73.1% (_2 p_=_0.012). Diffusion properties ofinter-hemispheric fibres, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and the longassociation fibres were identified to be the most discriminative in theclassification. Higher predicted probability scores were found in youngerpatients.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the widespread connectivity disruptionobserved in FES patients, especially in younger patients, might be consideredpotential individual discriminating biomarkers.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Early human brain development: Starring the subplate.,/pubmed/29935204,"This review summarizes early human brain development on the basis ofneuroanatomical data and functional connectomics. It indicates that the mostsignificant changes in the brain occur during the second half of gestation andthe first three months post-term, in particular in the cortical subplate andcerebellum. As the transient subplate pairs a high rate of intricatedevelopmental changes and interactions with clear functional activity, two phasesof development are distinguished: a) the transient cortical subplate phase,ending at 3 months post-term when the permanent circuitries in the primary motor,somatosensory and visual cortices have replaced the subplate; and subsequently,b) the phase in which the permanent circuitries dominate. In the associationareas the subplate dissolves in the remainder of the first postnatal year. Duringboth phases developmental changes are paralleled by continuous reconfigurationsin network activity. The reviewed literature also suggests that disruption ofsubplate development may play a pivotal role in developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder and schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term effects of iloperidone on cerebral dopamine receptor subtypes.,/pubmed/29935022,"The atypical antipsychotic drug iloperidone has high affinity for a wide range ofneurotransmitter receptors including dopaminergic (DA), serotonergic andadrenergic receptors. We examined the long-term effects of multiple doses ofiloperidone on DA D1 , D2 , D3 and D4 receptor subtypes. Sprague-Dawley adultrats (n=8/group) received daily intraperitoneal injections of iloperiodone (0.5, 1, or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. Receptor autoradiography quantified thelevels of DA receptors in medial prefrontal cortex (MPC), dorsolateral frontalcortex (DFC), caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hippocampus(HIP). Four weeks of iloperidone treatment at 5 mg/kg significantly increased D1 receptors in NAc (36%) and CPu (38%). Iloperidone (1.5 and 5 mg/kg)dose-dependently increased D2 receptors in MPC (37% and 47%) and HIP (32% and40%). Only the high dose of iloperidone (5 mg/kg) increased D2 receptors in NAc(39%) and CPu (38%). Repeated treatment with iloperidone (1.5 and 5 mg/kg)increased D4 receptors in the NAc (39% and 78%), CPu (42% and 83%) and HIP (54%and 72%). The three doses of iloperidone failed to alter D3 receptors in thebrain regions examined in this study. These results suggest that iloperidoneexerts region- and dose-specific effects on forebrain DA receptor subtypes, whichmay contribute to its therapeutic benefits in improving the positive and negativesymptoms of schizophrenia with minimal extrapyramidal side effects.

Executive dysfunctions differentially predict amotivation in first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder: a prospective 1-year follow-up study.,/pubmed/29934845,"Amotivation is a major determinant of functional outcome in schizophrenia but it is understudied in the early course of illness. There is a paucity oflongitudinal research investigating predictors of amotivation. In this study, we aimed to examine baseline cognitive and clinical predictors of amotivation at 6and 12Êmonths of follow-up in patients aged 18-55Êyears presenting withfirst-episode DSM-IV schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (FES). Of 145 patientsrecruited at intake, 116 and 113 completed assessments at 6- and 12-monthfollow-up, respectively. Amotivation was measured by avolition-apathy andanhedonia-asociality subscale scores of the Scale of the Assessment of NegativeSymptoms. Cognitive assessment was administered at baseline. As executivedysfunction has been more consistently found to be associated with negativesymptoms and amotivation in prior literature, we adopted fractionated approach tosubdivide executive function into distinct components encompassing switching and flexibility, response initiation, response inhibition, planning and strategyallocation, sustained attention and working memory. Our results showed thatbaseline amotivation (p_=_0.01) and switching and flexibility (p_=_0.01) werefound to independently predict amotivation at 6Êmonths follow-up. Baselineamotivation (p_<_0.01) and switching and flexibility (albeit with trend-wisesignificance, p_=_0.06) were also retained in final multivariate regression modelfor 12-month amotivation prediction. No other executive components or cognitivedomains predicted amotivation at follow-up. Findings of our study thus indicateamotivation at initial presentation as a critical determinant of subsequentmotivational deficits over 1Êyear of treatment for FES patients. Cognitiveflexibility might be specifically related to the development of amotivation inthe early stage of illness.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Education and employment trajectories from childhood to adulthood in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.,/pubmed/29934817,"22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common known microdeletion inhumans occurring in 1 out of 2000-4000 live births, with increasing numbers ofindividuals with the microdeletion living into adulthood. The aim of the studywas to explore the education and employment trajectories of individuals with22q11.2DS from childhood to adulthood in a large cohort composed of twosignificant samples. 260 individuals with 22q11.2DS, 134 male and 126 female,aged 5-59Êyears (mean age 21.3_±_10.8Êyears) were evaluated at two sites, Geneva (GVA) and Tel Aviv (TA). Psychiatric comorbidities, IQ score, and adaptivefunctioning were assessed using gold-standard diagnostic tools. Demographicfactors, such as data about education, employment, marital status, and livingstatus, were collected. Children entering elementary school (5-12Êyears) weresignificantly more likely to attend a mainstream school, while adolescents weresignificantly more likely to attend special education schools (p_<_0.005).Cognitive abilities, and not adaptive functioning, predicted school placement.Among adults with 22q11.2DS (n_=_138), 57 (41.3%) were unemployed, 46 (33.3%)were employed in open market employment, and 35 (25.4%) worked in assistedemployment. In adulthood, adaptive functioning more than cognitive abilitiespredicted employment. Surprisingly, psychotic spectrum disorders were not foundto be associated with employment. Individuals with 22q11.2DS are characterized byheterogeneity in educational and employment profiles. We found that cognitiveabilities and adaptive functioning, and not the presence of psychiatricdisorders, are key factors in school placement and employment. These factorsshould, therefore, be taken into account when planning optimal development ofindividuals with 22q11.2DS.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Glutathione and glutamate in schizophrenia: a 7T MRS study.,/pubmed/29934548,"In schizophrenia, abnormal neural metabolite concentrations may arise fromcortical damage following neuroinflammatory processes implicated in acuteepisodes. Inflammation is associated with increased glutamate, whereas theantioxidant glutathione may protect against inflammation-induced oxidativestress. We hypothesized that patients with stable schizophrenia would exhibit areduction in glutathione, glutamate, and/or glutamine in the cerebral cortex,consistent with a post-inflammatory response, and that this reduction would bemost marked in patients with ""residual schizophrenia"", in whom an early stagewith positive psychotic symptoms has progressed to a late stage characterized by long-term negative symptoms and impairments. We recruited 28 patients with stableschizophrenia and 45 healthy participants matched for age, gender, and parentalsocio-economic status. We measured glutathione, glutamate and glutamineconcentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula, and visualcortex using 7T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Glutathione andglutamate were significantly correlated in all three voxels. Glutamineconcentrations across the three voxels were significantly correlated with eachother. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced three clear components: anACC glutathione-glutamate component; an insula-visual glutathione-glutamatecomponent; and a glutamine component. Patients with stable schizophrenia hadsignificantly lower scores on the ACC glutathione-glutamate component, an effect almost entirely leveraged by the sub-group of patients with residualschizophrenia. All three metabolite concentration values in the ACC weresignificantly reduced in this group. These findings are consistent with thehypothesis that excitotoxicity during the acute phase of illness leads to reducedglutathione and glutamate in the residual phase of the illness.",N,,,,,,,,,,
NMDA-receptor inhibition and oxidative stress during hippocampal maturation differentially alter parvalbumin expression and gamma-band activity.,/pubmed/29934499,"Dysfunction of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons is thought to underliethe alterations of gamma-band oscillations observed in schizophrenia. Althoughthe pathomechanisms of this disease remain unclear, oxidative stress induced byNMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction and decreased glutathione (GSH) synthesizingcapacity have been shown to lead to PV-loss and aberrant oscillatory activity.However, the individual contributions of NMDAR-inhibition and GSH-depletion tothe developmental alterations observed in schizophrenia are largely unknown. Wetherefore investigated each condition in isolation using hippocampal slicecultures wherein interneuron maturation occurs entirely in vitro. Although bothtreatments caused oxidative stress, NMDAR-inhibition led to an immediatereduction in gamma oscillation frequency and a delayed loss of PV. In contrast,GSH-depletion immediately decreased PV expression and increased power, withoutaffecting frequency. Hence, although disturbances of PV-expression and gammaoscillations coexist in schizophrenia, they can arise from separate pathological processes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical evaluation of functional capacity in treatment resistant schizophrenia patients: Comparison and differences with non-resistant schizophrenia patients.,/pubmed/29934250,"Treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is defined by poor or non-response toconventional antipsychotic agents. Functional capacity is defined as the baselinepotential of a patient to function in the community, irrespective of actualachievements gained, and has never been studied in TRS. Here, we screened 182patients with psychotic symptoms and separated them in TRS (n_=_28) and non-TRS(n_=_32) ones, to evaluate whether they exhibited differential extents andpredictive clinical variables of functional capacity. Functional capacity wasmeasured by the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). Psychoticsymptoms by PANSS, social functioning by PSP and SLOF, clinical severity of theillness, cognitive functioning, and neurological soft signs (NSS) were assessed. TRS patients had non-significant lower UPSA scores compared to non-TRS (t-test:p_>_0.05). In TRS, UPSA score correlated with multiple clinical variables. Thehighest effect sizes were observed for PANSS negative score (r_=_-0.67,p_<_0.005); SLOF Area1 score (r_=_0.66, p_<_0.005); NSS severity (r_=_-0.61,p_<_0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that main predictors of UPSA score inTRS patients were PANSS negative score, education years, NSS, Problem Solvingperformances, and PSP score (F_=_11.12, R2_=_0.75, p_<_0.0005). These variableswere not predictive of UPSA score in non-TRS patients. Hierarchical analysisfound that variance in UPSA score mainly depended on negative symptoms, NSS, and problem solving (F_=_15.21, R2_=_0.65, p_<_0.0005). Path analysis individuatedtwo separate paths to UPSA score. These results delineate a limited andindependent group of candidate predictors to be putatively accounted fortherapeutic interventions to improve functional capacity, and possibly socialfunctioning, in TRS patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Aspects of Additional Psychiatric Disorders in Severe Depression/Melancholia: A Comparison between Suicides and Controls and General Pattern.,/pubmed/29933593,"OBJECTIVE: Additional and comorbid diagnoses are common among suicide victimswith major depressive disorder (MDD) and have been shown to increase the suicide risk. The aim of the present study was first, to investigate whether patientswith severe depression/melancholia who had died by suicide showed more additionalpsychiatric disorders than a matched control group. Second, general rates ofcomorbid and additional diagnoses in the total group of patients were estimatedand compared with literature on MDD.METHOD: A blind record evaluation was performed on 100 suicide victims withsevere depression/melancholia (MDD with melancholic and/or psychotic features:MDD-M/P) and matched controls admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund,Sweden between 1956 and 1969 and monitored to 2010. Diagnoses in addition tosevere depression were noted.RESULTS: Less than half of both the suicides and controls had just onepsychiatric disorder (47% in the suicide and 46% in the control group). Theaverage number of diagnoses was 1.80 and 1.82, respectively. Additional diagnoseswere not related to an increased suicide risk. Anxiety was the most commondiagnosis. Occurrence of suspected schizophrenia/schizotypal or additionalobsessive-compulsive symptoms were more common than expected, but alcohol usedisorders did not appear very frequent.CONCLUSIONS: The known increased risk of suicide in MDD with comorbid/additional diagnoses does not seem to apply to persons with MDD-M/P (major depressivedisorder-depression/Melancholia). Some diagnoses, such asschizophrenia/schizotypal disorders, were more frequent than expected, which isdiscussed, and a genetic overlap with MDD-M/P is proposed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Spinal Injuries in Suicidal Jumpers.,/pubmed/29933334,"STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective case series at a single institution.OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to investigate the characteristics of spinalinjuries in survivors of suicidal jumping.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal fracture/dislocation is associated withhigh-energy trauma such as that induced by motor vehicle accidents. Survivors of suicidal jumping sometimes sustain spinal injuries. However, the characteristics of such spinal injuries are unclear.METHODS: We identified 87 survivors of suicidal jumping who sustained spinalinjuries from 2007 to 2016 in our institution. We compared the demographic data, radiological findings, neurological status, associated injuries, treatments, and mental health conditions between these 87 survivors and 204 non-suicidal patientswith spinal injury.RESULTS: Suicidal jumpers were predominantly female (67%) and 10 years youngerthan non-suicidal patients. Mental health problems, mainly schizophrenia anddepression, were diagnosed in 77% of suicidal jumpers. Neurological damage fromspinal trauma was generally less severe in suicidal jumpers than in non-suicidal patients. Most spinal injuries in suicidal jumpers were located in the thoracicor lumbar spine region (85%). Among comorbid injuries, extremity injuries werehighly associated with spine injury in suicidal jumpers. Nearly 70% of suicidaljumpers exhibited extremity injury in contrast to 33% of non-suicidal patients.Approximately 25% of suicidal jumpers underwent surgical treatment. Surgicaltreatment was similarly performed on suicidal jumpers and non-suicidal patientsregardless of the discrepancy in neurological damage between these two groups.CONCLUSION: Spinal injuries in suicidal jumpers differed from spinal injuries in non-suicidal patients with regard to sex, age, mental health condition, injurylocation, neurologic damage, and associated injuries. Most survivors of suicidal jumping were young female patients with mental health problems. They tended tohave thoracic and lumbar spine trauma rather than cervical trauma with lesssevere neurological deficits and a higher incidence of accompanying limb injury.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Multivariate assessment of the central-cardiorespiratory network structure in neuropathological disease.,/pubmed/29933248,"OBJECTIVE: &#13; The new interdisciplinary field of network physiology is gettingmore and more into the focus of interest in medicine. The autonomic nervoussystem (ANS) dysfunction is well described in schizophrenia (SZO). However, thelinear and nonlinear coupling between the ANS and central nervous system (CNS) isonly partly addressed until now. This coupling can be assumed as afeedback-feedforward network, reacting with flexible and adaptive responses tointernal and external factors.&#13; Approach:&#13; For the first time, in thisstudy, we investigated linear and nonlinear short-term central-cardiorespiratory couplings of 17 patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia (SZO) incomparison to 17 age-gender matched healthy subjects (CON) analyzing heart rate(HR), respiration (RESP) and the power of frontal EEG activity (PEEG). Theobjective is to determine how the different regulatory aspects of the CNS-ANScompose the central-cardiorespiratory network (CCRN). To quantify these couplingswithin the CCRN the normalized short time partial directed coherence (NSTPDC) andthe new multivariate high-resolution joint symbolic dynamics (mHRJSD) wereapplied.&#13; Main results:&#13; We found that the CCRN in SZO is characterizedas a bidirectional one, with stronger central driving mechanisms (PEEG_HR)towards HR regulation than vice versa, and with stronger respiratory influence(RESP_PEEG) on central activity than vice versa. This suggests that thecentral-cardiorespiratory process (closed-loop) is mainly focusing on adaptingthe HR via the sinoatrial node than focusing on respiratory regulation. On theother side, the feedback-loop from ANS to CNS is strongly dominated viarespiratory activity. &#13; Significance:&#13; We could demonstrate aconsiderably significantly different central-cardiorespiratory network structure in schizophrenia with strong central influence on the cardiac system and a strongrespiratory influence on the central nervous system. Moreover, this studyprovides a more in-depth understanding of the interplay of the central andautonomic regulatory network in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients.&#13.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Subtyping attenuated psychotic symptoms: A cluster analytic approach.,/pubmed/29931670,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to examine the heterogeneity ofattenuated psychotic symptoms (PS) and related personality factors using acluster analytic approach.METHOD: A large sample of participants from the general population was evaluated in terms of attenuated symptomatology (psychotic and affective) and twopersonality factors: encoding style and impulsivity traits.RESULTS: Cluster analysis emphasized the existence of five independent clusters: High Psychosis, High Positive, High Negative, High Impulsive-Low Psychosis, andLow Psychosis. Cluster comparisons demonstrated that the personality factors and PS are differentially involved in the clusters.CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that reliable and relatively distinctclusters of individuals from the general population can be identified based onestablished PS and related personality factors. The fact that a variety ofprofiles was observed contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the heterogeneity characterizing PS and has clear theoretical and clinicalimplications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mega-analysis of Odds Ratio: A Convergent Method for a Deep Understanding of the Genetic Evidence in Schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29931221,"Numerous high-throughput omics studies have been conducted in schizophrenia,providing an accumulated catalog of susceptible variants and genes. The resultsfrom these studies, however, are highly heterogeneous. The variants and genesnominated by different omics studies often have limited overlap with each other. There is thus a pressing need for integrative analysis to unify the differenttypes of data and provide a convergent view of schizophrenia candidate genes(SZgenes). In this study, we collected a comprehensive, multidimensional dataset,including 7819 brain-expressed genes. The data hosted genome-wide associationevidence in genetics (eg, genotyping data, copy number variations, de novomutations), epigenetics, transcriptomics, and literature mining. We developed amethod named mega-analysis of odds ratio (MegaOR) to prioritize SZgenes.Application of MegaOR in the multidimensional data resulted in consensus sets of SZgenes (up to 530), each enriched with dense, multidimensional evidence. Weproved that these SZgenes had highly tissue-specific expression in brain andnerve and had intensive interactions that were significantly stronger than chanceexpectation. Furthermore, we found these SZgenes were involved in human braindevelopment by showing strong spatiotemporal expression patterns; thesecharacteristics were replicated in independent brain expression datasets.Finally, we found the SZgenes were enriched in critical functional gene setsinvolved in neuronal activities, ligand gated ion signaling, and fragile X mentalretardation protein targets. In summary, MegaOR analysis reported consensus sets of SZgenes with enriched association evidence to schizophrenia, providinginsights into the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Holistic Management of Schizophrenia Symptoms Using Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Treatment.,/pubmed/29930935,"Individuals with schizophrenia lead a poor quality of life, due to poor medicalattention, homelessness, unemployment, financial constraints, lack of education, and poor social skills. Thus, a review of factors associated with the holisticmanagement of schizophrenia is of paramount importance. The objective of thisreview is to improve the quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia, byaddressing the factors related to the needs of the patients and present them in aunified manner. Although medications play a role, other factors that lead to asuccessful holistic management of schizophrenia include addressing the following:financial management, independent community living, independent living skill,relationship, friendship, entertainment, regular exercise for weight gained dueto medication administration, co-morbid health issues, and day-care programmesfor independent living. This review discusses the relationship between different symptoms and problems individuals with schizophrenia face (e.g., homelessness andunemployment), and how these can be managed using pharmacological andnon-pharmacological methods. Thus, the target of this review is the carers ofindividuals with schizophrenia, public health managers, counselors, case workers,psychiatrists, and clinical psychologists aiming to enhance the quality of lifeof individuals with schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Correlates of Aggression in Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Effect Size Analysis.,/pubmed/29930519,"Background: Aggression in psychoses is of high clinical importance, andvolumetric MRI techniques have been used to explore its structural braincorrelates. Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching EMBASE,ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO through September 2017 using thesauri representingaggression, psychosis, and brain imaging. We calculated effect sizes for eachstudy and mean Hedge's g for whole brain (WB) volume. Methodological quality was established using the PRISMA checklist (PROSPERO: CRD42014014461). Results: Oursample consisted of 12 studies with 470 patients and 155 healthy controls (HC).After subtracting subjects due to cohort overlaps, 314 patients and 96 HCremained. Qualitative analyses showed lower volumes of WB, prefrontal regions,temporal lobe, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum, and higher volumes oflateral ventricles, amygdala, and putamen in violent vs. non-violent people with schizophrenia. In quantitative analyses, violent persons with schizophreniaexhibited a significantly lower WB volume than HC (p = 0.004), and also lowerthan non-violent persons with schizophrenia (p = 0.007). Conclusions: We reviewedevidence for differences in brain volume correlates of aggression in persons withschizophrenia. Our results point toward a reduced whole brain volume in violentas opposed to non-violent persons with schizophrenia. However, considerablesample overlap in the literature, lack of reporting of potential confoundingvariables, and missing research on affective psychoses limit our explanatorypower. To permit stronger conclusions, further studies evaluating structuralcorrelates of aggression in psychotic disorders are needed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reduction in Alpha Peak Frequency and Coherence on Quantitative Electroencephalography in Patients with Schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29930490,"Background: The aim of the study was to examine the characteristics of alpha wavepeak frequency, power, and coherence in patients with schizophrenia.Methods: Thirty-one patients with schizophrenia and age- and sex-matched subjectswith no psychopathology were enrolled. All study participants underwentquantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Alpha-related values, including peak frequency, power, and coherence, were evaluated.Results: Alpha peak frequency on the Oz area was slower in the schizophreniagroup than that in the control group. However, no differences in absolute orrelative power were observed between the two groups. Significant reductions inabsolute and relative coherence were observed at the C3-C4 and T3-T4 nodes in thepatients with schizophrenia. Relative coherence was reduced at the P3-P4 nodes.Conclusion: This study focused on alpha variables detected in QEEG as intrinsicvalues to distinguish schizophrenia from a healthy control. The results suggestdecreased alpha peak frequency of the occipital lobe and decreased coherencebetween the two hemispheres in patients with schizophrenia. A further study couldelucidate the causal relationship and biological meaning of the variations inalpha waves in patients with schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Significantly lower right middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity in the first episode of psychosis during neurocognitive testing.,/pubmed/29930227,"BACKGROUND: Changes in cerebral hemodynamics have been reported in schizophrenia and proposed as underlying the cognitive deficits seen in patients. The objectiveof our study was to compare changes of the cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV)during neurocognitive tasks between the patients with the first episode ofpsychosis and healthy controls.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 46 patients with the first episode ofpsychosis (FEP), admitted to the University Hospital Centre Zagreb during2016-2017 and 41 control subjects. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographymonitoring of BFV in both middle cerebral arteries was recorded during 25-minute long neurocognitive assessment with Phonemic Verbal Fluency test, Trial MakingTest B and Stroop test. Between every consecutive test resting periods wererecorded.RESULTS: After the adjustment for age, sex and education by quantile regression, patients with FEP had significantly lower BFV in middle cerebral arteries during the 3rd (_-15, _%-28% p=0.023) and 4th task (_-15, _%-28% p=0.031) of the Stroop test and the 1st task of Foot tapping test (_ -16, _% -30% p=0.034). We observed significantly lower changes of right middle cerebral artery BFV in FEP betweentwo consecutive tests in all four tasks of the Phonemic verbal fluency test, 1st and 2nd task of the Stroop test and Trail making test, and the1st task of Foottapping test; and of the left artery between first three tasks of the Phonemicverbal fluency test, the last one of the Phonemic verbal fluency test and allfirst three tasks of the Stroop test.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased middle BFV during the execution of particularneurocognitive tasks in patients with FEP, compared to control subjects mightindicate impaired hemodynamic function in the prefrontal/parietal brain areas,and possibly provide an explanation of some of the observed neurocognitivedeficits in patients with the first episode of psychosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Trace elements concentrations association with schizophrenia symptoms; A cross-sectional study in Croatia.,/pubmed/29930226,"BACKGROUND: Significant inconsistencies exist in findings on association ofbio-elements (BE) concentrations and schizophrenia. Hypothesis of this researchwas that different concentrations of BE are associated with differentpsychopathological schizophrenia symptoms.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from 2014 to 2016 at Psychiatric Hospital ""Sveti Ivan"" and University Psychiatric Hospital""Vrap_e"", Zagreb, Croatia, on the consecutive sample of 67 patients diagnosedwith schizophrenia. BE concentrations were measured by Inductively Coupled PlasmaMass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the Institute for Medical Research and OccupationalHealth in Zagreb. Severity of schizophrenia symptoms was assessed on BriefPsychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).RESULTS: After adjustment for all preplanned possible confounding variables, the first canonical correlation between BE and BPRS dimensions variates werestatistically significant (Rc2=0.73; P=0.006). The first pair of canonicalvariates is defined by BPRS negative dimension (and marginally by positivesymptoms and lack of resistance), and copper (Cu), lead (Pb), lithium (Li) andcobalt (Co) (marginally by cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni)).CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of different BE are associated with differentschizophrenia symptoms. Maximal correlation between BPRS and BE may be achievedwith the weighted linear composite of negative schizophrenia symptoms and copper (Cu), lead (Pb), lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co).",N,,,,,,,,,,
The combined effect of CYP2D6 and DRD2 Taq1A polymorphisms on the antipsychotics daily doses and hospital stay duration in schizophrenia inpatients (observational naturalistic study).,/pubmed/29930225,"BACKGROUND: To assess the correlation between the antipsychotics (AP) mean daily doses, hospital stay duration and CYP2D6, DRD2 polymorphisms in naturalisticstudy.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CYP2D6 polymorphisms *3, *4, *5, *6, *1XN and DRD2/ANKK1Taq1A polymorphisms were genotyped in a cohort of 226 Caucasian schizophrenicinpatients. AP daily doses, hospital stay duration and AP treatment duration weretaken from medical records. To compare mean daily doses of AP among CYP2D6 PMs,EMs, UMs and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A carriers the actual AP doses were converted tochlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalents and DDD (defined daily dose).RESULTS: Significant correlation (p=0.004) between CYP2D6 metabolic activity and AP mean daily doses was observed only among DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphic allelecarriers: 250.53 (95%CI: 154.90-346.17), 473.82 (95%CI: 426.99-520.64) 602.77(95%CI: 469.65-735.88) CPZ equivalents in PMs, EMs and UMs, consequently. PMswith DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A CT genotype received significantly lower doses of APcomparing to CC genotype (p=0.02). Mean hospital stay duration of PMs+UMs wassignificantly higher comparing to EMs (66.4 days (95% CI: 56.9-75.8) vs 50.2 days(95%CI: 45.5-54.7); p=0.047).CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of schizophrenia inpatients CYP2D6 metabolic activityaffects mean AP daily dose only in the presence of DRD2 Taq1A polymorphic allele.CYP2D6 metabolic activity correlates independently from DRD2 Taq1A polymorphismwith hospital stay duration. Subpopulation of schizophrenia inpatients withaltered CYP2D6 activity (PMs and UMs) carriers of Taq1A polymorphisms needsspecial attention of clinicians in aligning of AP treatment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Reliability of the bicaudate parameter in the revealing of the enlarged lateral Ventricles in schizophrenia patients.,/pubmed/29930224,"INTRODUCTION: In schizophrenia patients the lateral ventricle enlargement hasmostly been reported in relationship with smaller cortical and/or subcorticalbrain volumes; and it has been observed that ventricular system growth may be aconsequence of the smaller caudate nucleus volume. Bicaudate parameters have beenused in the Alzheimer dementia and Huntington's chorea diagnosing in order toevaluate brain changes and the enlargement of the lateral ventricles.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study has been carried out on 140 patients out ofwhich 70 patients (30 men and 40 women) who met the ICD 10 criteria forschizophrenia and 70 healthy controls (30 men and 40 women) matched on sex andage with the studied group. All of them underwent direct caudatometry and volume computation based on MRI scans.RESULTS: Except for the bicorporal line, for all the parameters were obtained thestatistically highly significant differences between the examined and controlgroups. Significant correlation was established for the majority of bicaudateparameters and volumes of the caudate nuclei and lateral ventricles.DISCUSSION: Enlargement of the lateral ventricles is one of the most frequent MRIfinding in schizophrenia patients. Ventricles are enlarging gradually and frontalhorns are more affected than other parts. The increased volumes of the caudatenuclei signalized that ventricular enlargement is not the consequence of thecaudate atrophy.CONCLUSION: Bicaudate parameters are reliable parameters for the quickorientation in order to assess the enlarged ventricles in schizophrenia patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain.,/pubmed/29930110,"Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity andoften share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap.

Psychiatric disordersshare common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinctfrom one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identifiedsignificant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, includingcognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Computerized cognitive training is associated with improved psychosocial treatment engagement in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29929773,"Poor treatment engagement is an enduring problem in the care of patients withschizophrenia. Evidence suggests that targeted cognitive training (TCT) improves cognition and functional outcomes, but this time-consuming intervention mightreduce patients' engagement in other treatment activities when implemented inreal-world settings. This is especially true of residential care programs whichencourage patients to engage in group therapies, self-care, and a wide variety ofstructured social, work, and other rehabilitation activities. This study aimed todetermine whether TCT negatively impacts engagement in other psychosocialtreatments. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited from a community-basedresidential care program and randomized to one of two intervention arms:treatment as usual (TAU; n_=_22) or TAU augmented with TCT (n_=_24). Psychosocialtreatment engagement was tracked over 20_weeks. Treatment groups did notsignificantly differ on baseline variables or psychosocial treatment engagementin the 5_weeks prior to randomization. TCT had a positive effect on engagement(__=_0.112, p_=_0.003), but there was no treatment-by-time interaction(__=_-0.029, p_=_0.672). Participants in TCT engaged in an average of 1.34additional group therapies, 0.58 additional activities of daily living, and 0.84 additional rehabilitation activities per week in comparison to TAU participants. Baseline cognition was also a significant predictor of psychosocial treatmentengagement. Overall, results suggest that TCT can be implemented in real-worldsettings without negatively impacting engagement in other psychosocialtreatments. Additional studies are needed to determine what role nonspecificfactors play in the positive impact of TCT.",RCT,,,,Treatment as usual augmented with targeted cognitive training,Treatment as usual,,,Schizophrenia,Pyschosocial treatment engagement,
"Sibship size, birth order and psychotic experiences: Evidence from 43 low- and middle-income countries.",/pubmed/29929772,"BACKGROUND: Sibship size and birth order may be contributing factors to themultifactorial etiology of psychosis. Specifically, several studies have shownthat sibship size and birth order are associated with schizophrenia. However,there are no studies on their association with psychotic experiences (PE).METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based data from 43 low- and middle-incomecountries which participated in the World Health Survey were analyzed. TheComposite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify four types ofpast 12-month PE. The association of sibship size and birth order with PE wasassessed with multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 212,920 adults [mean (SD) age 38.1 (16.0) years; 50.7% females]. In the multivariable analysis, compared to individualswith no siblings, the OR increased linearly from 1.26 (95%CI_=_1.01-1.56) to 1.72(95%CI_=_1.41-2.09) among those with 1 and ³_9 siblings, respectively. Comparedto the first-born, middle-born individuals were more likely to have PE whenhaving a very high number of siblings (i.e. ³9).CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should examine the environmental and biologicalfactors underlying the association between sibship size/birth order and PE.Specifically, it may be important to examine the unmeasured factors, such aschildhood infections and adversities that may be related to both family structureand PE.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Suspension of the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices: the importance of adhering to the evidence.,/pubmed/29929542,"Recently the United States Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Usedisclosed having suspended the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs andPractices, stating it was so deficient in both rigor and breadth that it must be replaced. However, a closer examination of her claims about the Registryindicates many of them to be inaccurate. Contrary to her assertions, the Registryis not devoid of medication-assisted treatments for opioid use; nor does itcontain but a scant few interventions related to schizophrenia and psychosis.Moreover, many of her criticisms regarding rigor pertain to reviews completedsince late 2015, when the Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration altered key aspects of the Registry. In contrast to reviewsgenerated under the 2007 rules, these newer reviews rely on fewer references,incorporate less expert input, are more likely to be based exclusively on grayliterature, and are no longer required either to provide dissemination readiness information or meet certain minimum research quality standards. However, only 123(25.7%) of the 479 Registry interventions have been reviewed solely using theproblematic 2015 criteria, with the remaining 356 interventions having a reviewwhich use the 2007 guidelines. Yet, rather than address the agency's recentmissteps and expand the Registry's content coverage, the agency appears to havedecided to invest considerable resources into replacing it, relying heavily onexpert consensus versus empirical data in its initial attempt to do so.

Brief multifamily Psychoeducation for family members of patients with chronic major depression: a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/29929495,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and often chronicproblem. Patients with chronic MDD often have negative impacts on the health oftheir families. Family psychoeducation is recognized as part of the optimaltreatment for patients with psychotic disorder, and has been shown to reduce the rate of relapse in individuals with schizophrenia and to reduce the burden ontheir caregivers. Thus, we predict that family psychoeducation has the potential to reduce the burden on the caregivers of patients with chronic MDD. In thepresent study, we aimed to investigate the effects of brief multifamilypsychoeducation (BMP) on the mental health status of family members of patientswith chronic MDD.METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial consisting of 49 chronic MDD patients and their families. Each family was randomly assigned to either the BMP intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received four BMP sessions,once every two weeks for eight weeks. The control group received one counselingsession administered by a nurse. All patients received standard treatmentadministered by physicians. The primary outcome measurement was the KesslerScreening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6) score of family members at 16-weeks after the first BMP session. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms ofboth family members and patients at multiple time points, as well as familyfunctioning as evaluated by the patients. Intention-to-treat analyses wereconducted.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant effect of BMP on K6 scores at 16-weeks (mean difference 1.17, 95% confidence interval: -_0.63 to 2.98, P_=_0.19). Exploratory analyses revealed that BMP reduced depressive symptoms in familymembers at 8- weeks (difference_=_-_3.37, 95%CI -6.32 to -_0.43, P_=_0.02) andimproved family functioning at multiple time points (Role; 8ÊW,difference_=_-_0.13, 95%CI -0.26 to -_0.00, P_=_0.04, Affective Responsiveness;8ÊW, difference_=_-_0.24, 95%CI -0.43 to -_0.05, P_=_0.01, 32ÊW,difference_=_-_0.22, 95%CI -0.41 to -_0.03, P_=_0.02, Behavior Control; 16ÊW,difference_=_-_0.17, 95%CI -0.34 to -_0.00, P_=_0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Four BMP sessions did not significantly reduce the psychologicaldistress of family members of patients with chronic MDD.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials. gov NCT01734291 , retrospectively registered(Registration date: November 21, 2012).",RCT,,,,Brief multifamily psychoeducation,Control,,,Family members of patients with chronic major depressive disorder,Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6) score,
Glutamatergic Deficits in Schizophrenia - Biomarkers and Pharmacological Interventions within the Ketamine Model.,/pubmed/29929462,"BACKGROUND: The basic mechanism of pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia has barelychanged in the last 60 years. Currently used medications allow the effectivetreatment of positive symptoms via antagonistic effects at dopamine receptorswhereas the effect on negative and cognitive symptoms is most often negligible.METHODS: The observation that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR)antagonists such as ketamine transiently induce schizophrenia-like positive,negative and cognitive symptoms has led to a paradigm shift from dopaminergic to glutamatergic dysfunction in pharmacological models of schizophrenia.RESULTS: The NMDAR hypofunction can explain not only the whole range ofschizophrenia symptoms but also the dopaminergic dysfunction itself, and itemphasizes the need for pharmacologicallytargeted glutamatergicneurotransmission. Moreover, ketamine-induced psychopathological changes inhealthy participants were accompanied by altered electro-(EEG),magnetoencephalographic (MEG) (e.g. Mismatch Negativity (MMN), N100), andfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, reminiscent of findingsobserved in patients with schizophrenia. Hence, the ketamine model offers thepossibility to assess the effect of novel pharmacological agents onschizophrenia-like symptoms and neurophysiology, thereby potentially facilitatingdrug research and development by providing a way to ascertain functional targetengagement and the ability to prioritize candidate drugs.CONCLUSION: Therefore, this review summarizes the recent evidence from EEG, MEGand fMRI studies on potential biomarkers found in healthy subjects treated withketamine and pharmacological interventions within the ketamine model.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting suicidal behaviour after first episode of non-affective psychosis: The role of neurocognitive functioning.,/pubmed/29929113,"BACKGROUND: Suicide has been recognised as one of the major causes of prematuredeath in psychosis. However, predicting suicidal behaviour (SB) is stillchallenging in the clinical setting and the association of neurocognition with SBin psychosis remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of neurocognitive performance as predictor of SB. Also, we sought to exploredifferences in the evolution of clinical and neurocognitive functioning betweenparticipants with/without history of suicide attempts (SA) over follow-up period.METHODS: The sample of the study is composed by 517 patients. Sociodemographic,clinical, functional and neurocognitive measures were evaluated at baseline aswell as 1-year and 3 years after first episode of psychosis. Bivariate andmultivariate analyses explored the influence of these variables as putativebaseline predictors of SB. Repeated measures analyses of variance testeddifferences in clinical and neurocognitive outcomes at 1- and 3-year follow-up.RESULTS: Global cognitive functioning (GCF) (OR_=_1.83, 95% CI_=_1.25-2.67) andsevere depressive symptoms (OR_=_1.17, 95% CI_=_1.07-1.28) predicted SB.Longitudinal analyses revealed that patients with SB at follow-up presented with higher levels of remission in terms of positive psychotic symptoms anddepression. In addition, those with a history of SB had worse GCF and visualmemory than those without such antecedents.CONCLUSIONS: GCF was found to be the most robust predictor of SB along withsevere depressive symptomatology. Hence, poorer cognitive performance in FEPappears to emerge as a risk factor for suicidal behaviour from early stages ofthe illness and a comprehensive neurocognitive assessment may contribute to risk assessment.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Schizotypal traits and their relation to rejection sensitivity in the general population: Their mediation by quality of life, agreeableness and neuroticism.",/pubmed/29929085,"Schizotypal traits are a cluster of personality styles suggesting a potentialliability for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Interpersonal schizotypal traits include cognitive disorganisation which consists of social anxiety, andintrovertive anhedonia which consists of a lack of pleasure in social activities.Rejection sensitivity is evident all along this continuum. This study aimed todetermine whether psychosocial quality of life (QOL), neuroticism andagreeableness mediates the relation between schizotypy and rejection sensitivity.Three hundred and eighteen participants from a predominantly University studentpopulation completed an online survey measuring schizotypy, rejectionsensitivity, quality of life, and the five-factor personality traits. Aregression analysis determined the prediction of rejection sensitivity byschizotypy, quality of life, and the five personality traits. Analyses examinedthe mediation of the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and rejectionsensitivity by psychological QOL, social QOL, neuroticism, and agreeableness.Cognitive disorganisation and introvertive anhedonia predicted greater rejection sensitivity, which in turn were mediated by psychological QOL, social QOL,neuroticism, and agreeableness. The findings show that interpersonal schizotypyrelates to greater rejection sensitivity. Psychosocial factors that lower one'sability to have positive feelings, trusting relationships, and prosocialbehaviour, and personality traits that increase worrying mediate thisassociation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The impact of reward on attention in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928599,"Traditionally, attention was thought to be directed by either top-down goals orbottom-up salience. Recent studies have shown that the reward history of astimulus feature also acts as a powerful attentional cue. This is particularlyrelevant in schizophrenia, which is characterized by motivational and attentionaldeficits. Here, we examine the impact of reward on selective attention.Forty-eight people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 34 non-psychiatric controlsubject (NCS) discriminated the location of a target dot appearing inside a left circle or right circle. The circles were different colors, one of which wasassociated with reward via pre-training. In the first 2 blocks, targets wereequally likely to appear in the left or right circle. In the last 4 blocks, thetarget was 75% likely on one side, thus allowing us to separately examine howattention was impacted by reward (color) and probability (location). PSZ hadslower overall reaction times (RTs) than NCS. Both groups showed robust effectsof spatial probability and reward history, with faster RTs for the rewarded colorand for the more probable location. These effects were similar in PSZ and NCS.Negative symptom severity correlated with overall RT slowing, but there were nocorrelations between symptoms and reward-associated biasing of attention. PSZdemonstrated RT slowing but normal reward history and spatial probability-driven RT facilitation. These results are conceptually similar to prior findings showingintact implicit reward effects on response bias, and suggest that implicitprocessing of reward and probability is intact in PSZ.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The relationship between clinical insight and cognitive and affective empathy in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928598,"Background: Schizophrenia is often associated with poor clinical insight(unawareness of mental illness and its symptoms) and deficits in empathy, whichare important for social functioning. Cognitive empathy has been linked toclinical insight while affective empathy and its role in insight and pathologyhave received mixed evidence.Methods: Instruments assessing symptomatology (Positive and Negative SyndromeScale; PANSS), clinical insight (Scales to assess awareness of mental disorders; SUMD), and cognitive and affective empathy were administered to 22 participantswith first episode and chronic schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls.Self-report, parent-report, and performance based measures were used to assesscognitive and affective empathy (The interpersonal reactivity index; IRI/Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test/Faux Pas) to reduce bias and parse shared variance.Results: Age of onset, gender, and symptomatology emerged as significantpredictors of poor clinical insight. Additionally, the fantasy subscale of theIRI as reported by parents emerged as a positive predictor while the personaldistress (parent report) subscale emerged as a negative predictor of awarenessinto mental illness. There were significant differences on performance-basedmeasures of empathy between the control and schizophrenia groups.Conclusion: Findings suggest that affective empathy is relatively intact acrossphases of illness whereas cognitive empathy abilities are compromised and couldbe targets for psychotherapy intervention.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Effect of cognitive function on jumping to conclusion in patients with schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928597,"The ""jumping to conclusion"" (JTC) bias is related to the formation andmaintenance of delusions. Higher JTC bias can be based on both neurocognitivedysfunction and social cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between JTC bias,neurocognition, and social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. A total of22 patients with schizophrenia and 21 controls participated in this study.Neurocognition and social cognition were assessed using the Brief Assessment ofCognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and Social Cognition Screening Questionnaire(SCSQ), respectively. The JTC bias and the decision confidence were assessedusing the beads task. The patients were classified into the JTC group (withhigher JTC bias; n_=_10) and JTC-non group (n_=_12). The JTC group scoredsignificantly lower on verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed sub-scores of BACS than the JTC-non group. No difference in social cognition was observedbetween the two groups. The decision confidence was predicted by metacognition,which is an SCSQ sub-score. Similarly to the patients, the controls wereclassified into the JTC group (higher JTC bias; n_=_9) and the JTC-non group(n_=_12). There were no significant differences in neurocognition and socialcognition between the control JTC and JTC-non groups. The present resultsindicated that JTC bias is related to neurocognition and decision confidence isrelated to social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. These findings maybridge the gaps between psychotic symptom and cognitive dysfunction inschizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predictive timing disturbance is a precise marker of schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928596,"Timing disturbances have being proposed as a key component of schizophreniapathogenesis. However, the contribution of cognitive impairment to such disordershas not been clarified. Here, we investigated duration estimation and predictive timing in 30 patients with DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) compared to 30healthy controls (HC). Duration estimation was examined in a temporal and colour discrimination task, fully controlled for working memory (WM) and attentionrequirements, and by more traditional temporal production and temporal bisection tasks. Predictive timing was measured in a temporal and spatial orienting ofattention task. Expectations about stimulus onset (temporal condition) orlocation (spatial condition) were induced by valid and invalid symbolic cues.Results showed that discrimination of temporal and colour stimulus attributes wasequally impaired in SZ. This, taken with the positive correlation betweentemporal bisection performance and neuropsychological measures of WM, indicatesthat duration estimation impairments in SZ are underpinned by WM dysfunction.Conversely, we found dissociation in temporal and spatial predictive ability inSZ. Unlike controls, patients were selectively unperturbed by events appearing atan unexpected moment in time, though were perturbed by targets appearing at anunexpected location. Moreover, patients were able to generate temporalexpectations more implicitly, as their performance was influenced by thepredictive nature of the flow of time itself. Our findings shed new light on the debate over the specificity of timing distortions in SZ, providing evidence that predictive timing is a precise marker of SZ, more sensitive than durationestimation, serving as a valid heuristic for studying the pathophysiology of the disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term treatment with clozapine and verbal memory performance in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928595,"Clozapine is more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotics for positiveand negative symptoms, although it is related with serious adverse effects.Because of this profile, it could also have an impact on cognition. Therefore, weevaluated learning ability of 31 treatment-resistant individuals with SZ usingclozapine uninterruptedly for 18.23_±_4.71_years and 26 non-treatment-resistantusing other antipsychotics that never used clozapine. Long-term treatment withclozapine did not improve verbal learning ability better than otherantipsychotics.

Speech-on-speech masking and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29928594,"People with schizophrenia have impairments of target-speech recognition (TSR) in noisy environments with multiple people talking. This study investigated whether the TSR impairment in schizophrenia is associated with their impaired auditoryworking memory or certain psychotic symptoms. Thirty participants withschizophrenia (mean age_=_35.2_±_12.7_years) and 30 demographics-matched healthy controls (mean age_=_32.9_±_10.9_years) were tested for their TSR against atwo-talker-speech masker. Auditory working memory and memory capacity wereevaluated using the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and Digit SpanTest. Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The results showed that participants with schizophrenia had higherTSR threshold (i.e., poorer TSR performance) and poorer PASAT scores than theirhealthy controls. Moreover, positive correlations (with age, sex, educationalyears, ill-duration, and dosage of antipsychotics controlled as covariates) were revealed between the TSR threshold and the PANSS-positive syndrome (especiallydelusion), and between the TSR threshold and the PANSS-negative syndrome(especially lack of spontaneity in speech and passive-apathetic-social withdraw).However, neither the PASAT nor the forward digit span exhibited significantcorrelations with the TSR. This study provides evidence that the TSR impairment(i.e., augmented vulnerability to informational speech masking), which reflectsdisorganization of speech information processing (inability in either inhibiting unrelated speech signals or capturing the wanted speech signals), is specificallyassociated with the severity of delusion, poverty of speech, and hypobulia,suggesting the potential value of the TSR impairment used for predicting certain core symptoms of schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Diminished Hedonic response in neuroleptic-free youth at ultra high-risk for psychosis.,/pubmed/29928593,"Hedonic response is preserved in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whetherthis is also true in individuals meeting criteria for ""prodromal"" psychosis, who are considered to be at symptomatic high risk for developing the disorder. Inthis study, we examined neurophysiological and self-reported response toemotional stimuli in UHR (nÊ=Ê23) and healthy control (CN: nÊ=Ê30) participantswho passively viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images for 500Êms whilethe electroencephalogram was recorded and then provided self-reports of valenceand arousal to the stimuli. The Late Positive Potential (LPP) event relatedpotential (ERP) component was used as a neurophysiological marker of emotionalreactivity. Results indicated that CN participants had higher LPP amplitude forpleasant and unpleasant compared to neutral stimuli; however, UHR youth displayedno differences in LPP amplitude among pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral stimuli. Self-report data mirrored neurophysiological data, as UHR youth had lower reportsof positive emotion to pleasant stimuli and negative emotion to unpleasantstimuli compared to CN participants. Furthermore, the presence of a mood disorderdiagnosis predicted reduced neurophysiological emotional reactivity in UHR youth.Findings suggest that youth at UHR for psychosis display diminished subjectiveand neurophysiological reactivity to emotional stimuli, and that symptoms ofdepression may result in diminished emotional reactivity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Computational Analysis of Neonatal Mouse Ultrasonic Vocalization.,/pubmed/29927553,"Neonatal vocalization is structurally altered in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Entropy analysisdetermines the degree of non-random call sequencing. A Markov model determinesthe actual call sequences used by pups. Sparse partial least squares discriminantanalysis (sPLS-DA) identifies call sequences that differentiate groups andreveals the degrees of individual variability in call sequences between groups.These three sets of analyses can be used to identify the otherwise hidden callstructure that is altered in mouse models of developmental neuropsychiatricdisorders, including not only autism but also schizophrenia. © 2018 by John Wiley& Sons, Inc.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, 2 warranted revision of their diagnoses as there had beenno recurrence of psychotic symptoms and they had remained antipsychotic-free for several years despite displaying a dysthymic state; 1 fulfilled remissioncriteria on intermittent low-dose antipsychotics but kept a distance from anypotential stressor; 1 achieved full remission with good functioning anddiscontinued medications for a year, but resumed taking antipsychotics afterfeeling an impending relapse; the other 4 showed common courses of chronicschizophrenia with repeated admission and/or rehabilitation programs in otherservice systems.CONCLUSIONS: The trajectories after first-episode psychosis should not beover-simplified by calculating the probability of relapse or the odds ofachieving adequate functioning determined by medication adherence or not.Examining from a dynamic perspective employing a qualitative approach to takeinto account diagnostic stability, treatment preferences, psychosocial factors,individual coping strategies and personalized formulation of illness, we can gainmore insight into the ambiguous information revealed by the recent literature.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Clinical high risk for psychosis: The effects of labelling on public stigma in a undergraduate population.,/pubmed/29927070,"AIM: Schizophrenia is a highly stigmatized disorder. Identification of youth athigh risk for psychosis has the potential for improved outcomes. However,identifying youth at risk could subject them to increased public stigma. Using anexperimental vignette design, this study examined relative levels of publicstigma elicited by the labels ""schizophrenia,"" ""clinical high risk (CHR),""""attenuated psychotic symptoms syndrome (APSS),"" a label implying normativeadolescent development (""a bad breakup""), and a no-label control condition.METHODS: Ninety-six undergraduates (age: 18.8_+_1.1, range: 18-22) read avignette describing an adolescent experiencing symptoms typical of CHR forpsychosis. The vignette label (APSS, CHR, schizophrenia, a bad breakup or nolabel) was counterbalanced between participants. Participants answered questions assessing stigma toward the individual and their prior knowledge of andfamiliarity with psychosis.RESULTS: Overall stigma did not differ across conditions. Only ratings ofpersonal responsibility were higher for the breakup label than the schizophrenia label (P_<_.05). More prior knowledge about, and higher familiarity with,psychotic symptoms predicted lower overall stigma.CONCLUSION: We did not find that schizophrenia, CHR or APSS labels elicitedelevated stigma in this sample relative to the control labels. This may reflectrelatively low levels of mental health stigma in the group studied, a new findinginconsistent with earlier work. Greater levels of knowledge about and familiaritywith psychosis were associated with lower stigma. These findings reinforce thepotential for mental health awareness campaigns to reduce stigma but also raisequestions about factors contributing to lower rates of stigma.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Relationship between behavioral measures of anxiety and latent inhibition in mature rats.,/pubmed/29926398,"This study adopted a novel approach to relating nonhuman and human studies ofanxiety and latent inhibition, by exploring the degree to which rats'""temperaments"" in relation to anxiety predicted the development of latentinhibition. It investigated whether anxiety levels in one situation (i.e., anelevated-plus maze) involving 38 intact, mature rats, could predict performanceon a latent inhibition task (i.e., an animal model of attention), and, thus,reproduce findings from human studies. Rats were subjected to two tasks: a novel within-subject, appetitive stimulus pre-exposure procedure, and an elevated-plus maze task. In the stimulus pre-exposure task, non-reinforced exposure to a light led to facilitation of conditioning (perceptual learning) during the first 3days, and to retardation of conditioning (latent inhibition) during the last 5days. In the elevated-plus maze task, moderate levels of anxiety were observed.Regression analyses revealed that anxiety levels (plus maze) were a significantpredictor of latent inhibition (stimulus pre-exposure). Measures of locomotoractivity did not predict performance on the latent inhibition task. Rats withmoderate levels of anxiety had better performance in the late inhibition taskthan animals with low levels of anxiety. These data and the methodology haveimplications for understanding nonhuman models of schizophrenia, and for thedesign of studies investigating these issues with nonhumans.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment of Neurocognitive Functions in 7-Year-Old Children at Familial High Risk for Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder: The Danish High Risk and Resilience Study VIA 7.,/pubmed/29926086,"Importance: Children at familial high risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders(FHR-SZ) or bipolar disorder (FHR-BP) exhibit neurocognitive impairments. Largestudies of neurocognition in young children at familial high risk at the same ageare important to differentiate the pathophysiology and developmental trajectoryof these 2 groups.Objective: To characterize neurocognitive functions in 7-year-old children withFHR-SZ or FHR-BP and a control population.Design, Setting, and Participants: This multisite population-based cohort studycollected data from January 1, 2013, to January 31, 2016, in the first wave ofthe Danish High Risk and Resilience Study VIA 7 at 2 university hospital researchsites in Copenhagen and Aarhus using Danish registries. Participants(n_=_514)included 197 children with FHR-SZ, 118 with FHR-BP, and 199 controlsmatched with the FHR-SZ group for age, sex, and municipality. Assessors wereblinded to risk status.Exposures: Parents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or neither diagnosis.Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurocognitive functions were measured across 23tests. Four neurocognitive domains were derived by principal component analysis, including processing speed and working memory, verbal functions, executive andvisuospatial functions, and declarative memory and attention.Results: A total of 514 children aged 7 years were included in the analysis(46.3% girls), consisting of 197 children with FHR-SZ (46.2% girls), 118 withFHR-BP (46.6% girls), and 199 controls (46.2% girls). Children with FHR-SZ weresignificantly impaired compared with controls on processing speed and workingmemory (Cohen d_=_0.50; P_<_.001), executive and visuospatial functions (Cohend_=_0.28; P_=_.03), and declarative memory and attention (Cohen d_=_0.29;P_=_.02). Compared with children with FHR-BP, children with FHR-SZ performedsignificantly poorer in processing speed and working memory (Cohen d_=_0.40;P_=_.002), executive and visuospatial functions (Cohen d_=_0.35; P_=_.008), anddeclarative memory and attention (Cohen d_=_0.31; P_=_.03). Children with FHR-BP and controls did not differ.Conclusions and Relevance: Children with FHR-SZ had widespread neurocognitiveimpairments, supporting the hypothesis of neurocognitive functions asendophenotypes of schizophrenia. The absence of neurocognitive deficits inchildren with FHR-BP suggests distinct neurodevelopmental manifestations in thesefamilial high-risk groups at this age. Early detection of children with FHR-SZand cognitive impairments is warranted to investigate associations ofneurocognition with transition to psychosis, add to the knowledge of theirdevelopmental pathophysiology, and inform early intervention programs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Trajectories and changes in individual items of positive and negative syndrome scale among schizophrenia patients prior to impending relapse.,/pubmed/29925851,"Effective early detection of impending relapse may offer opportunities for early interventions to prevent full relapse in schizophrenia patients. Previouslyreported early warning signs were not consistently validated by prospectivestudies. It remains unclear which symptoms are most predictive of relapse. Toprioritize the symptoms to be captured by periodic self-report intechnology-enabled remote assessment solutions for monitoring symptoms anddetecting relapse early, we analyzed data from three relapse-prevention studiesto identify individual items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) that changed the most prior to relapse and to understand exactly when thesesymptoms manifested. Relapse was defined by a composite endpoint:hospitalization, suicidal/homicidal ideation, violent behavior, a 25% increase inthe PANSS total score, or a significant increase in at least one of severalpre-specified PANSS items. Longitudinal mixed effect models were applied to modelthe trajectories of individual PANSS items before relapse. Among 267 relapsedpatients, the PANSS items that increased the most at relapse from randomizationdid not differ much by different relapse reasons or medications. A subset ofseven PANSS items, including delusions, suspiciousness, hallucinations, anxiety, excitement, tension, and conceptual disorganization, had on average >_1-point of increase at relapse. The trajectories of these items suggested these itemsstarted to increase 7-10 days before relapse and reached on average 1-point ofincrease 0.3_~_1.2 days before relapse.

Autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,/pubmed/29925476,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have suggested a possible autoimmune contribution in a subsetof patients with schizophrenia.

The incidence rates of schizophrenia with a maximum follow-up period of10_years between patients with and without AD were compared using a Coxproportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidenceinterval (95% CI).RESULTS: The main finding was the discovery of a higher incidence of subsequentschizophrenia in patients with AD (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.23-2.4) after adjustmentfor other demographic characteristics. Specifically, the risk of schizophreniawas observed to be a significant increase in systemic lupus erythematosus (3.73, 2.07-6.72), rheumatoid arthritis (2.89, 1.97-4.23), dermatomyositis (5.85,1.32-25.94) and autoimmune vasculitis (2.44, 1.17-5.06). Also, this studyrevealed some potential risk factors for developing schizophrenia, includingyounger age (less than or equal to 50_years) and some comorbidities(hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and alcohol use disorder). Conversely, this study found that steroid use was a potential protective factorfor the development of schizophrenia.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that AD were associated with an increased risk ofdeveloping schizophrenia, suggesting that the abnormal autoimmune process wasassociated with an increase in the expression of psychiatric disturbances.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and minimal self-disturbance in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis and with first-episode schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29925474,"BACKGROUND: In the tradition of phenomenology, minimal selfdisturbance has beensuggested as a manifestation of the core pathogenesis of schizophrenia; however, the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here, in line with the conceptof ""cognitive dysmetria,"" we investigated the cerebro-cerebellar default modenetwork (DMN) connectivity and its association with pre-reflective minimalselfdisturbance in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis andpatients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES).METHODS: Thirty-three UHR individuals, 18 FES patients, and 56 healthy controls(HCs) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during rest at baseline.Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed using thecerebellar DMN seeds from the bilateral Crus I, followed by between-groupcomparisons. Correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationshipbetween the cerebro-cerebellar FC and the self-reported severity of minimalself-disturbance in the UHR and FES groups, respectively.RESULTS: FES participants showed significantly reduced cerebellar FC with theleft presupplementary motor area (preSMA), right anterior prefrontal cortex(aPFC), and precuneus compared to HCs, while UHR participants showed anintermediate decrease between the other two groups, particularly in the leftpreSMA and right aPFC. Minimal self-disturbance, which appeared at similar levelsin both UHR and FES groups, was significantly associated with cerebro-cerebellar FC, although each group presented different patterns of associations.CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant cerebro-cerebellar FC, which may be closely related tominimal self-disturbance, may be able to provide meaningful insights into thereal gestalt of schizophrenia and contribute to further research to predictfuture psychosis in UHR individuals.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Relapse After Antipsychotic Discontinuation in Schizophrenia as a Withdrawal Phenomenon vs Illness Recurrence: A Post Hoc Analysis of a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study.,/pubmed/29924507,"BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that relapse rates after antipsychoticdiscontinuation may be artificially inflated and that some of these symptomrecurrences may be due to rebound or withdrawal phenomena rather than due toillness recurrence.METHODS: Post hoc analysis of data from a relapse-prevention study (conductedfrom March 2005 to February 2007) of paliperidone palmitate once-monthly (PP1M)versus placebo was conducted to compare the nature of operationally definedrelapse events in schizophrenia patients (diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria)experiencing relapses after randomization to placebo (n = 97) with those inpatients receiving maintenance PP1M treatment (n = 36). These 2 groups werecompared for onset and severity of recurrence symptoms, symptom profiles atrelapse, and postrelapse treatment response. Psychological and physiologicalsigns of discontinuation and signs of antipsychotic tolerance, dyskinesia, andprolactin elevation that might indicate dopamine receptor supersensitivity werecompared.RESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of relapse symptom profiles, onset andseverity of relapse symptoms, and postrelapse treatment response. The Positiveand Negative Syndrome Scale total score (mean ± SD) for placebo versusmaintenance treatment group at baseline was 54.5 ± 11.74 vs 54.1 ± 11.64 and atrelapse was 75.6 ± 16.79 vs 75.2 ± 17.23 (P = .9). No elevated blood pressure or heart rate, dyskinesia, antipsychotic tolerance, or elevated prolactin in thepatients relapsing after antipsychotic discontinuation was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that relapses after treatment discontinuationreflect recurrence of the underlying illness and may be consistent with ahypothesis of direct relationship between dopamine and psychosis. No evidence wasobtained for withdrawal-related phenomena contributing to the high relapse rates after treatment discontinuation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00111189.",RCT,,,,Paliperidone palmitate once daily,Placebo,,,Schizophrenia,"Onset and severity of recurrence symptoms, symptom profiles at relapse, and postrelapse treatment response",
Editorial Perspective: From schizophrenia polygenic risk score to vulnerability (endo-)phenotypes: translational pathways in child and adolescent mental health.,/pubmed/29924396,"The Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) approach is becoming increasingly prominent inpsycho-behavioral research, however, its translational potential is stillrelatively underconceptualized. Indeed, PRS paradigm (which capitalizes on thecombination of multiple genetic markers into a single proxy score to predictlifetime outcomes) has the potential to unravel some of the developmentalcomplexities leading to severe mental disorders. With respect to schizophrenia,the application of PRS approach to child-adolescent cohorts from the generalpopulation, provides a crucial vantage point for understanding how presumedgenetic predisposition is manifested during developmental years. Clearly, this isessential for etiological research as well as for the timely identification ofthe earliest stages of those specific psychopathological trajectories leading to psychosis. Therefore, the translational import of the PRS approach could improve our etiopathogenetic understanding of schizophrenia (e.g., allowing thedisentanglement of the respective contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors along neurodevelopment) and further refine current staging models forearly detection of vulnerability to psychosis (e.g., providing the rationale for more developmentally oriented reformulations of clinical high-risk criteria).",N,,,,,,,,,,
Mini-review: Update on the genetics of schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29923609,"A number of important findings have recently emerged relevant to identifyinggenetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Findings using common variants pointtowards gene sets of interest and also demonstrate an overlap with otherpsychiatric and nonpsychiatric disorders. Imputation of variants of the gene for complement component 4 (C4) from GWAS data has shown that the predictedexpression of the C4A product is associated with schizophrenia risk. Very rarevariants disrupting SETD1A, RBM12 or NRXN1 have a large effect on risk. Otherrare, damaging variants are enriched in genes that are loss of functionintolerant and/or whose products localise to the synapse. These and particularcopy number variants can result in increased risk of schizophrenia but also ofother neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings for C4 and NRXN1 may beespecially helpful for elucidating the biological mechanisms that can lead todisease.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Cognitive assessments included executivefunction, working memory, attention, and immediate and delayed memory. Socialcognitive measures assessed facial emotion processing and theory-of-mindabilities.RESULTS: Trauma-exposed participants showed higher levels of schizotypy,especially suspiciousness, relative to non-exposed individuals, regardless ofclinical or HC status. Furthermore, trauma-exposed individuals showed deficitsspecifically in social cognitive, but not general cognitive abilities, regardlessof clinical or HC status. These trauma-related results were found in the context of higher schizotypy levels in both SZ and BD relative to HC, and lower cognitiveand social cognitive performance in SZ, relative to BD and HC groups.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that childhood trauma exposure impactslong-term schizotypy outcomes, especially paranoid ideation (suspiciousness), as well as complex social cognitive abilities in both healthy and psychoticpopulations. However, cognitive deficits associated with psychotic illness maynot be distinguishable from those related to trauma exposure in previous studies.PRACTITIONER POINTS: Findings Childhood trauma exposure is associated withincreased schizotypal features (in particular paranoid ideation) and complexsocial cognitive abilities, independently of the diagnosis of psychotic disorder.Cognitive and social cognitive deficits were larger in schizophrenia compared to bipolar-I cases and healthy controls, but increased schizotypal features wereobserved in both schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder relative to healthycontrols. Limitations We were unable to distinguish the specific effects ofparticular childhood trauma exposures due to the high rate of exposure to morethan one type of maltreatment. Retrospective assessment of childhood trauma inadulthood cannot be externally validated, and associations with behaviouraltraits in later life may be confounded by other factors not studied here.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cannabinoids for Treatment of MS Symptoms: State of the Evidence.,/pubmed/29923025,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cannabis and cannabinoids have been used medically andrecreationally for thousands of years and recently there has been a growing body of research in this area. With increased access now that medical marijuana isavailable in many jurisdictions, patients and providers want to know more aboutthe evidence for benefits and risks of cannabinoid use. This paper provides anoverview of the available cannabinoid-based formulations, a summary of thehighest quality evidence for the use of cannabinoids for treating spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), and a discussion of possible dosingregimens based on information from these studies.RECENT FINDINGS: Two recent high-quality systematic reviews concluded that theonly strong evidence for medical marijuana in neurological disorders was forreducing the symptoms of patient-reported spasticity and central pain in MS andthat the only complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention in MSwith strong supportive evidence was cannabinoids. Based on this review, theyconcluded that nabiximols (Sativex oral spray), oral cannabis extract (OCE), and synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably effective at reducingpatient-reported symptoms of spasticity in people with MS, but OCE and synthetic THC were not found to be effective for reducing physician-administered measuresof spasticity. In addition, nabiximols, OCE, and synthetic THC are probablyeffective at reducing MS-related pain. Cannabinoids were generallywell-tolerated. However, cannabis use has been associated with an increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia in at-risk individuals, there is growing evidence that cannabis can increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, includingmyocardial infarction (MI), hypertension, heart failure, and stroke, and arecently recognized adverse effect of cannabis is cannabinoid hyperemesissyndrome. The medical use of cannabinoids remains controversial. Whilecannabinoids have been studied for a variety of neurologic disorders, there isstrongest evidence to indicate benefits in treatment of spasticity andneuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Although the best dose for an individual remains uncertain, most participants in the studies discussed in this paper used between 20 and 40Êmg of THC a day in divided doses. Adverse events in studieswere generally more common in the groups using cannabinoid products but seriousadverse events were rare and cannabis products were generally well-tolerated.Cannabis use does appear to be associated with increased risk of certain adverse events, including psychosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cannabinoid hyperemesissyndrome.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neurocognitive Functioning in Patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: A Meta-Analytic Review.,/pubmed/29922984,"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a known risk factor for development of schizophrenia and is characterized by a complex neuropsychological profile. Todate, a quantitative meta-analysis examining cognitive functioning in 22q11.2DShas not been conducted. A systematic review of cross-sectional studies comparing neuropsychological performance of individuals with 22q11.2DS with age-matchedhealthy typically developing and sibling comparison subjects was carried out.Potential moderators were analyzed. Analyses included 43 articles (282 effects)that met inclusion criteria. Very large and heterogeneous effects were seen forglobal cognition (dÊ=Ê-Ê1.21) and in specific neuropsychological domains(intellectual functioning, achievement, and executive function; d rangeÊ=Ê-Ê0.51 to -Ê2.43). Moderator analysis revealed a significant role for type of healthycomparison group used (typically developing or siblings), demographics (age, sex)and clinical factors (externalizing behavior). Results revealed significantdifferences between pediatric and adult samples, with isolated analysis withinthe pediatric sample yielding large effects in several neuropsychological domains(intellectual functioning, achievement, visual memory; d rangeÊ=Ê-Ê0.56toÊ-Ê2.50). Large cognitive deficits in intellectual functioning and specificneuropsychological variables in individuals with 22q11.2DS represent a robustfinding, but these deficits are influenced by several factors, including type of comparison group utilized, age, sex, and clinical status. These findingshighlight the clinical relevance of characterizing cognitive functioning in22q11.2DS and the importance of considering demographic and clinical moderatorsin future analyses.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Neural Correlates for Intrinsic Motivational Deficits of Schizophrenia; Implications for Therapeutics of Cognitive Impairment.,/pubmed/29922185,"The ultimate goal of the treatment of schizophrenia is recovery, a notion relatedto improvement of cognitive and social functioning. Cognitive remediationtherapies (CRT), one of the most effective cognition enhancing methods, have beenshown to moderately improve social functioning. For this purpose, intrinsicmotivation, related to internal values such as interest and enjoyment, has beenshown to play a key role. Although the impairment of intrinsic motivation is one of the characteristics of schizophrenia, its neural mechanisms remain unclear.This is related to the lack of feasible measures of intrinsic motivation, and itsresponse to treatment. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), not onlyintrinsic motivation, but extrinsic motivation has been reported to enhancelearning and memory in healthy subjects to some extent. This finding suggests thecontribution of different types of motivation to potentiate the ability of theCRT to treat cognitive impairment of schizophrenia. In this paper, we provide areview of psychological characteristics, assessment methods, and neuralcorrelates of intrinsic motivation in healthy subjects and patients withschizophrenia. Particularly, we focus on neuroimaging studies of intrinsicmotivation, including our own. These considerations are relevant to enhancementof functional outcomes of schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Sex Differences in Psychiatric Disease: A Focus on the Glutamate System.,/pubmed/29922129,"Alterations in glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain,are implicated in several psychiatric diseases. Many of these psychiatricdiseases display epidemiological sex differences, with either males or femalesexhibiting different symptoms or disease prevalence. However, little work hasconsidered the interaction of disrupted glutamatergic transmission and sex ondisease states. This review describes the clinical and preclinical evidence forthese sex differences with a focus on two conditions that are more prevalent inwomen: Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder, and three conditionsthat are more prevalent in men: schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, andattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These studies reveal sex differences atmultiple levels in the glutamate system including metabolic markers, receptorlevels, genetic interactions, and therapeutic responses to glutamatergic drugs.Our survey of the current literature revealed a considerable need for moreevaluations of sex differences in future studies examining the role of theglutamate system in psychiatric disease. Gaining a more thorough understanding ofhow sex differences in the glutamate system contribute to psychiatric diseasecould provide novel avenues for the development of sex-specificpharmacotherapies.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A systematic literature review of the clinical and health economic burden of schizophrenia in privately insured patients in the United States.,/pubmed/29922078,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review onthe burden of schizophrenia in privately insured US patients.Materials and methods: A systematic literature review of English languagepeer-reviewed journal articles of observational studies published from 2006 to2016 was conducted using EMBASE/MEDLINE databases. Abstracts covering substantialnumbers of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (i.e., N ³100) were included for full-text review. Articles that did not clearly specifyprivate insurance types were excluded.Results: A total of 25 studies were reviewed; 10 included only privately insured patients; and 15 included a mix of different types of insurance. The review ofthe clinical burden of schizophrenia revealed the following: compared to patientswith no mental disorders, those with schizophrenia had significantly increasedodds of systemic disorders and both alcohol and substance abuse. Antipsychotic(AP) adherence was low, ranging from 31.5% to 68.7%. The medication possessionratio for AP adherence ranged from 0.22 to 0.73. The review of the healtheconomic burden of schizophrenia revealed the following: patients with a recent(vs. chronic) diagnosis of schizophrenia had significantly higher frequencies of emergency department visits and hospitalizations and greater length of stay (LOS)and total annual per-capita costs. Mean all-cause hospitalizations and LOSdecreased significantly after (vs. before) initiating long-acting injectable APs (LAIs). Patients also had significantly decreased mean all-cause, andschizophrenia-related, hospitalization costs after initiating LAIs. Total direct per-capita costs of care (but not pharmacy costs) for patients who werenonadherent to their oral APs within the first 90 days of their index event were significantly higher (vs. early adherent patients). Despite these potentialbenefits, only 0.25%-13.1% of patients were treated with LAIs across all studies.Conclusion: Privately insured US patients with schizophrenia experience asubstantial clinical and health economic burden related to comorbidities, acutecare needs, nonadherence, and polypharmacy and have relatively low use of LAIs.Further study is warranted to understand prescribing patterns and clinicalpolicies related to this patient population.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Initiating/maintaining long-acting injectable antipsychotics in schizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolar disorder - expert consensus survey part 2.,/pubmed/29922063,"Objective: The aim of this study was to provide recommendations on initiating andmaintaining long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in individuals withschizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolar disorder.Methods: A 50-question survey comprising 916 response options was completed by 34expert researchers and high prescribers with extensive LAI experience, ratingrelative appropriateness/importance on a 9-point scale. Consensus was determined using chi-square test of score distributions. Results of 21 questions comprising 339 response options regarding LAI initiation, maintenance treatment, adequatetrial definition, identifying treatment nonresponse, and switching are reported.Results: Experts agreed that the most important LAI selection factor was patient response/tolerability to previous antipsychotics. An adequate therapeutic LAItrial was defined as the time to steady state ± 1-2 injection cycles. Expertssuggested that oral efficacy and tolerability should be established beforeswitching to an LAI, without consensus on the required time, and that the timefor oral supplementation and next injection interval should be determined by the time to attainment of therapeutic LAI levels. Most experts agreed that ³1adequate LAI trial is needed to identify the lack of efficacy. There was littleagreement about strategies for switching between LAIs.Conclusion: Expert guidance may aid clinicians in their decisions regardinginitiating/maintaining LAIs in individuals with schizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolar disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Consensus was determined using chi-square test of score distributions.Mean (standard deviation) ratings were calculated. Responses to 29 questions (577options) relating to appropriate patients and clinical scenarios for LAI use are reported.Results: Recommendations aligned with research on risk factors for nonadherenceand poor outcomes for patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolardisorder. Findings suggested, contrary to general practice patterns, that LAI usemay be appropriate earlier in the disease course and in younger patients. Resultsfor bipolar disorder were similar to those for schizophrenia but with lessconsensus. Numerous facilitators of LAI prescribing were considered important,particularly that LAIs may reduce relapses and improve outcomes.Conclusion: Findings support wider use of LAIs in patients withschizophrenia/schizoaffective and bipolar disorders beyond the setting of pooradherence and earlier use in the disease course.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Treatment response prediction and individualized identification of first-episode drug-naÌøve schizophrenia using brain functional connectivity.,/pubmed/29921920,"Identifying biomarkers in schizophrenia during the first episode without theconfounding effects of treatment has been challenging. Leveraging thesebiomarkers to establish diagnosis and make individualized predictions of futuretreatment responses to antipsychotics would be of great value, but there has beenlimited progress. In this study, by using machine learning algorithms and thefunctional connections of the superior temporal cortex, we successfullyidentified the first-episode drug-naive (FEDN) schizophrenia patients (accuracy78.6%) and predict their responses to antipsychotic treatment (accuracy 82.5%) atan individual level. The functional connections (FC) were derived using themutual information and the correlations, between the blood-oxygen-level dependentsignals of the superior temporal cortex and other cortical regions acquired with the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We also found that themutual information and correlation FC was informative in identifying individualFEDN schizophrenia and prediction of treatment response, respectively. Themethods and findings in this paper could provide a critical step towardindividualized identification and treatment response prediction in first-episode drug-naive schizophrenia, which could complement other biomarkers in thedevelopment of precision medicine approaches for this severe mental disorder.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Dopamine D2 Receptor Supersensitivity as a Spectrum of Neurotoxicity and Status in Psychiatric Disorders.,/pubmed/29921706,"Abnormality of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) function, often observed as D2Rsupersensitivity (D2RSS), is a commonality of schizophrenia and relatedpsychiatric disorders in humans. Moreover, virtually all psychotherapeutic agentsfor schizophrenia target D2R in brain. Permanent D2RSS as a feature of a newanimal model of schizophrenia was first reported in 1991, then behaviorally andbiochemically characterized over the next 15-20 years. In this model ofschizophrenia characterized by production of D2RSS in ontogeny, there aredemonstrated alterations of signaling processes; as well as functional linksbetween the biologic template of the animal model; and ability ofpharmacotherapeutics to modulate or reverse biological and behavioral modalities towards normality. Another such animal model, featuring knockout of TraceAmine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1), demonstrates D2RSS with an increase of theproportion of D2R in the high affinity state. Currently, TAAR1 agonists are beingexplored as a therapeutic option for schizophrenia. There is likewise an overlay of D2RSS with substance use disorder. The aspect of adenosine A2A-D2heteroreceptor complexes in substance use disorder is highlighted, and theassociation of A2AR antagonists in discriminative and rewarding effects ofpsychostimulants is outlined. In summary, these new animal models ofschizophrenia have face validity, construct validity and predictive validity, andwith distinct advantages over earlier models. While the review summarizeselements of D2RSS in schizophrenia per se, and its interplay with substance usedisorder, a major focus is on presumed new molecular targets attending D2RSS inschizophrenia and related clinical entities.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Characterization CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms using HRMA in Psychiatry patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disease for personalized medicine.",/pubmed/29921201,"BACKGROUND: The interindividual genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymeseffects the impact and toxicity in plenty of drugs.OBJECTIVE: The CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphismscharacterized using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) in follow-up patientsin psychiatry clinic as a preliminary preparation for personalized medicine.METHOD: Genotyping of CYP1A2*1F, CYP2C9 *2, *3, CYP2C19 *2, *3 and *17 and CYP2D6*3, *4 was conducted in 101 patients using HRMA. Genotype and allele frequencies of the CYP variants were found to be in equilibrium with the Hardy-Weinbergequation.RESULTS: The frequency of the CYP1A2*1F allele in schizophrenia and bipolardisease was 0.694 and 0.255, respectively. The CYP2C9 allele frequencies were0.087 (CYP2C9*2), and 0.549 (CYP2C9*3) for bipolar; 0.278 (CYP2C9*2) and 0.648(CYP2C9*3) in schizophrenias. The CYP2C19*2 and *17 allele frequencies was 0.111 and 0.185 in schizophrenia and variant *2 was 0.117 and variant *17 was 0.255 in bipolar group. The frequency of the CYP2D6*3 allele was 0.027 in schizophrenias. The frequencies for the CYP2D6*4 variant was 0.092 and 0.096 in schizophrenia andbipolar groups, respectively.CONCLUSION: The knowledge in pharmacogenomics and also the developments inmolecular genetics are growing rapidly.

A Comparison of Participants in Two Community-Based Programs: Assisted Outpatient Treatment and a Mental Health Court.,/pubmed/29921190,"OBJECTIVE: Mental health courts and assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) are toolsto help people with serious mental illness engage in treatment and avoid orreduce institutionalization. As both programs become increasingly prevalent,questions remain about whether people with severe mental illness who receive AOT have the same characteristics, histories, and service needs as those whoparticipate in mental health courts. If there are differences, each program mayrequire assessments and interventions tailored to the specific characteristicsand needs of participants.METHODS: This study examined administrative criminal justice and mental healthservices data for 261 people with serious mental illness who participated in AOT,a mental health court, or both over seven years.RESULTS: Three percent of the sample participated in both programs. Compared withparticipants in mental health court, participants in AOT were older, less likely to have an alcohol use disorder, and more likely to have a schizophrenia spectrumdisorder than a bipolar disorder. The participants' histories of crisis mentalhealth service utilization, hospitalization, and incarceration prior to programentry varied significantly by program.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there are differences among individualswith serious mental illness who are served by AOT and mental health courtprograms. AOT participants had greater engagement with mental health services,and a significant portion of AOT participants also had a prior criminal historythat placed them at risk of future justice involvement.

Salivary Inflammatory Markers in Trichotillomania: A Pilot Study.,/pubmed/29920483,"BACKGROUND: Immune dysregulation has been hypothesized to be important in thedevelopment and pathophysiology of compulsive disorders such as obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), which has a high comorbid overlap withtrichotillomania (both are OC-related disorders). The role of inflammation in thepathophysiology of trichotillomania has garnered little research to date.METHODS: Individuals with trichotillomania provided saliva sample for analysis ofinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, these participants were examined on avariety of demographic variables (including body mass index [BMI], previouslyfound to relate to inflammation) along with clinical measures (symptom severity, functioning, and comorbidity).RESULTS: Thirty-one participants, mean age of 24.7 (±10.2) years, 27 (87.1%)females were -included. The mean score on the Massachusetts GeneralÊHospital HairPulling Scale was 15.7 (±4.2), reflective of moderate symptom severity. Compared to normative data, theÊmean inflammatory marker levels in thetrichotillomaniaÊsampleÊhad the following Z scores: interleukin-1_ (IL-1_) ZÊ=-0.26, IL-6 ZÊ= -0.39, IL-8 ZÊ= -0.32, and tumor necrosis factor-_ Z =Ê-0.83.Levels of inflammatory markers did not correlate significantly with BMI,depressive mood, symptom severity, or disability.CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low level of inflammatory saliva cytokines observedin the current study (negative z scores versus normative data with medium effect sizes) indicates that evaluation of blood inflammatory levels in trichotillomaniaversus matched controls would be valuable in future work. If a hypoinflammatorystate is confirmed -using blood samples, this would differentiatetrichotillomania from other mental disorders (such as OCD, schizophrenia, anddepression), which have typically been linked with high inflammatory measures in the literature, at least in some cases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Predictors and Moderators of Antipsychotic-Related Weight Gain in the Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study.,/pubmed/29920116,"BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-related weight gain is a common clinically relevantside effect when treating psychotic disorders in pediatric populations, yet fewpredictors and no moderators of antipsychotic-related weight gain are known.METHODS: The Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS)study randomized 119 youths (age 8-19 years) with schizophrenia orschizoaffective disorder to 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment with molindone,risperidone, or olanzapine and assessed treatment response and side effects. Inthis secondary analysis, we used multivariable linear regression and receiveroperating characteristic analysis to investigate predictors and moderators ofweight change and percent weight change from baseline to week 8.RESULTS: Treatment assignment was the most discriminant predictor of weightchange [F(2, 66)_=_17.00, p_<_0.001] and percent weight change [F(2, 66)_=_16.85,p_<_0.001]. Mean weight gain was 0.74 (standard deviation ±3.51) kg formolindone, 4.13_±_3.79_kg for risperidone, and 7.29_±_3.44_kg for olanzapine.After adjusting for treatment assignment, lower pretreatment hemoglobin A1C(HgbA1C) predicted more weight gain [F(1, 55)_=_4.71, p_=_0.03]. Diagnosis(schizoaffective vs. schizophrenia) moderated weight change [F(2, 63)_=_6.02,p_=_0.004] and percent weight change [F(2, 63)_=_5.26, p_=_0.008] such thatschizoaffective diagnosis predicted larger weight gain for youths in therisperidone treatment arm. Age, sex, family income, baseline weight, and symptomsneither predicted nor moderated weight change or percent weight change.CONCLUSION: We identified prognostic subgroups and novel risk factors forantipsychotic-related weight gain. We confirmed that antipsychotic choice isextremely important for predicting future weight gain. We also found that youngerage did not predict greater weight gain, in contrast to prior studies.

Association between cortical GABA and Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials (LDAEP) in humans.,/pubmed/29917080,"Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is a widely usedelectroencephalography (EEG) based biomarker for central serotonergic activity.Serotonin has been shown to be associated with different psychiatric disorderssuch as depression and schizophrenia. Despite its clinical significance, theunderlying neurochemical mechanism of this promising marker is not fullyunderstood and further research is needed to improve its validity. Otherneurotransmitters might have a significant impact on this measure. Thus, weassessed the inhibitory action through individual GABA/H20 concentrations andGABA/Glutamate ratios by means of MRS at 3T in healthy subjects. The measurementswere assessed in the primary auditory cortex in order to investigate theassociation with the LDAEP, whose generators are mainly in the primary auditorycortex. For the first time, this study examines the link between GABAergicneurotransmission and LDAEP, and the data preliminary show that GABA may notcontribute to the generation of EEG-based LDAEP.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Associations between P3a and P3b amplitudes and cognition in antipsychotic-naÌøve first-episode schizophrenia patients.,/pubmed/29914589,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are already present in early stages ofschizophrenia. P3a and P3b event-related potentials (ERPs) are believed tounderlie the processes of attention and working memory (WM), yet limited researchhas been performed on the associations between these parameters. Therefore, weexplored possible associations between P3a/b amplitudes and cognition in a large cohort of antipsychotic-nave, first-episode schizophrenia (AN-FES) patients and healthy controls (HC).METHODS: Seventy-three AN-FES patients and 93 age- and gender-matched HC wereassessed for their P3a/b amplitude with an auditory oddball paradigm. Inaddition, subjects performed several subtests from the CambridgeNeuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).RESULTS: AN-FES patients had significantly reduced P3a/b amplitudes, as well assignificantly lower scores on all cognitive tests compared with HC. Total groupcorrelations revealed positive associations between P3b amplitude and WM andsustained attention and negative associations with all reaction time measures.These associations appeared mainly driven by AN-FES patients, where we found asimilar pattern. No significant associations were found between P3b amplitude andcognitive measures in our HC. P3a amplitude did not correlate significantly with any cognitive measures in either group, nor when combined.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further evidence for P3a/b amplitude deficitsand cognitive deficits in AN-FES patients, which are neither due toantipsychotics nor to disease progress. Furthermore, our data showed significant,yet weak associations between P3b and cognition. Therefore, our data do notsupply evidence for deficient P3a/b amplitudes as direct underlying factors forcognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Olfactory impairment in first-episode schizophrenia: a case-control study, and sex dimorphism in the relationship between olfactory impairment and psychotic symptoms.",/pubmed/29914416,"BACKGROUND: A body of studies has focused on the olfactory impairment amongpeople with schizophrenia. The effect of sex on this relationship has attractedthe attention of researchers. These issues have not been studied much in Chinese schizophrenia patients.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 110 first-episode antipsychoticmedicine nave schizophrenia patients aged 18-35Êyears and 110 controls, matched by age and sex. Odour threshold, discrimination and identification were assessed by the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. Psychotic symptoms were assessed by the Positiveand Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).RESULTS: The odour threshold, discrimination and identification scores ofpatients with schizophrenia were significantly lower than those of the healthycontrol group. The difference in identification score had statisticalsignificance between male and female patients with schizophrenia (t_=_-_2.45,P_<_0.05). Controlling for confounding factor, in male schizophreniaparticipants, the negative subscale score was significantly and inverselycorrelated with the discrimination (__=_-_0.37, p_<_0.008), identification(__=_-_0.45, p_<_0.008) and TDI (__=_-_0.50, p_<_0.008) scores; the generalpsychopathology subscale score was inversely and significantly correlated withthe identification (__=_-_0.47, p_<_0.008) and TDI (__=_-_0.41, p_<_0.008)scores.

Associations among domains of self-disturbance in schizophrenia.,/pubmed/29913377,"Self-disturbances are increasingly recognized as important, possibly evencentral, features of schizophrenia. However, little is known about theassociations among different manifestations of self-disturbances. The aims of thecurrent study were threefold. We aimed to (1) replicate previous findings ofincreased self-disturbances in schizophrenia, (2) correlate manifestations ofself-disturbances in schizophrenia across three domains, and (3) correlateself-disturbances with five symptoms domains of schizophrenia, includingpositive, negative, disorganized symptoms, excitement, and emotional distress. Weexamined three domains of self-experience, including somatosensation, anomalousself-experiences, and self-concept clarity. Participants included 48 individuals with schizophrenia and 36 non-psychiatric controls. The results of this studyreplicate previous findings of significantly higher levels of self-disturbancesin people with schizophrenia. The results also indicate positive correlationsbetween the domains of anomalous self-experiences and self-concept clarity, butnot somatosensation, in individuals with schizophrenia. As well, anomalousself-experiences were positively correlated with positive symptoms, disorganized symptoms, and emotional distress and self-concept clarity was negativelycorrelated with disorganized symptoms and emotional distress.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in the present study, somebiochemical changes within GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission thatcould be related to observed MK-801-induced disturbances and the activity ofcompounds active at those neurotransmitters were investigated. In biochemicalexperiments, mice were treated acutely or chronically with MK-801 (13_days,0.4_mg/kg). Their brains were dissected and frontal cortices and hippocampi were taken for further analysis. The levels of neurotransmitters were investigatedwith HPLC, and the expression of surrogate markers of schizophrenia (5-HT1Areceptors, GAD65, and GAD67, at both protein and mRNA levels) was measured viawestern blotting and qRT-PCR. The modified forced swim test and locomotoractivity were used to assess the activity of GABAB and 5-HT1A-related compounds. Repeated MK-801 treatment (13_days, 0.4_mg/kg dose) led to decreases in theDOPAC/DA, 3MT/DA and HVA/DA metabolic ratios. Increased 5-HT1A protein expressionand decreased GAD65 and GAD67 protein expression was observed in both the cortex and hippocampus. mRNA levels for all proteins were decreased. The increasedimmobility in the forced swim test was reversed both by a GABAB agonist(SKF97541, 0.025 or 0.05_mg/kg), a positive allosteric modulator of GABABreceptor (racBHFF, 5 or 10_mg/kg) and by a 5-HT1A agonist ((R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT 0.01or 0.025_mg/kg). Our research supports the hypothesis that changes in the levels of GABA and/or 5-HT1A receptors may contribute to the schizophrenia-likephenotype, and GABAergic and serotonergic agents may be good candidates fortreating negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Investigating the association of ventral and dorsal striatal dysfunction during reward anticipation with negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals.,/pubmed/29912880,"BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia and also found in healthy individuals in subclinical forms. According to the current literature the two negative symptom domains, apathy and diminished expression may havedifferent underlying neural mechanisms. Previous observations suggest thatstriatal dysfunction is associated with apathy in schizophrenia. However, it isunclear whether apathy is specifically related to ventral or dorsal striatalalterations. Here, we investigated striatal dysfunction during rewardanticipation in patients with schizophrenia and a non-clinical population, todetermine whether it is associated with apathy.METHODS: Chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 23)underwent an event- related functional MRI, while performing a variant of theMonetary Incentive Delay Task. The two negative symptom domains were assessed in both groups using the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale.RESULTS: In schizophrenia patients, we saw a strong negative correlation between apathy and ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. In contrast, there was no correlation with diminished expression. In healthycontrols, apathy was not correlated with ventral or dorsal striatal activationduring reward anticipation.CONCLUSION: This study replicates our previous findings of a correlation between ventral striatal activity and apathy but not diminished expression in chronicschizophrenia patients. The association between apathy and reduced dorsalstriatal activity during reward anticipation suggests that impairedaction-outcome selection is involved in the pathophysiology of motivationaldeficits in schizophrenia.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis of Clozapine Use and Safety by Using Comprehensive National Data From the Japanese Clozapine Patient Monitoring Service.,/pubmed/29912802,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate clozapine use and itsassociated adverse effects in patients in Japan.METHODS: We analyzed data recorded from July 2009 to January 2016 (N = 3780patients) in the Clozaril Patient Monitoring Service, which was established inJapan in 2009 and includes all Japanese patients who have been prescribedclozapine.RESULTS: The treatment discontinuation rate was 23.9% (869/3780 cases). Theaverage ± SD treatment duration was 234.9 ± 306.9 days (median, 115 days), andthe average ± SD dosage was 186.41 ± 151.6 mg/d. The estimated treatmentcontinuation rates resulting from all-cause discontinuation were 78.2 after 1year and 72.9% after 2 years of treatment. The incidence ofneutropenia/leucopenia was 5.4% (206/3780 cases). The average ± SD dose beforediscontinuation was 233.36 ± 168.15 mg (median, 200 mg; range, 4-600 mg). Theincidence of glucose intolerance was 15.4% (583/3780 cases). Of 3780 patients, 98(2.67%) developed glucose intolerance before and after taking clozapineadministration, whereas 485 patients (12.8%) developed glucose intolerance after taking clozapine. The average ± SD time from treatment initiation to new onset ofglucose intolerance was 382.2 ± 420.2 days (median, 216 days; range, 4-2053days).CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study, particularly regarding theincidence of clozapine-induced adverse events, will enable the optimal and safeuse of clozapine in Japanese patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Adjunct Aripiprazole Reduces Prolactin and Prolactin-Related Adverse Effects in Premenopausal Women With Psychosis: Results From the DAAMSEL Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29912799,"PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Prolactin-related adverse effects contribute to nonadherence and adverse health consequences, particularly in women with severe mentalillness. Treating these adverse effects may improve treatment acceptability,adherence, and long-term outcomes.METHODS/PROCEDURES: Premenopausal women with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision diagnosis of schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder were recruited for a randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week trial of adjunct aripiprazole (5-15mg/d). Participants had elevated prolactin (>24 ng/mL) and were experiencinggalactorrhea, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or sexual dysfunction on aprolactin-elevating antipsychotic. Participants were evaluated biweekly forprolactin elevation and galactorrhea and completed a menstrual diary review.Psychiatric symptoms and adverse effects were closely monitored.FINDINGS/RESULTS: Forty-six women were randomized (n = 25 aripiprazole, n = 21placebo). Thirty-seven completed at least 8 weeks of the study (n = 20 [80%]aripiprazole and n = 17 [81%] placebo). Aripiprazole (mean dose, 11.7 ± 2.4 mg/d)was effective for lowering prolactin relative to placebo (P = 0.04). In addition,45% (9/20) of the aripiprazole group had a normalized prolactin (<24 mg/mL)compared with 12% (2/17) of the placebo group (P = 0.028). Galactorrhea resolved in 77% (10/13) of the aripiprazole-treated participants compared with 33% (4/12) in the placebo group (P = 0.028). Normalization of sexual function (<16 on theArizona Sexual Experience Scale) occurred in 50% on aripiprazole (7/14) versus 9%(1/11) on placebo (P = 0.030). No differences between groups in symptoms oradverse effects were noted. Overall, women rated a mean score of 4.6 ± 0.6 on a5-point Likert scale for sexual function improvement, suggesting their particularsatisfaction with improvement in this domain.IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Building upon prior studies, this rigorous evaluationconfirms the utility of adjunctive aripiprazole as a strategy for improvingprolactin and managing prolactin-related adverse effects in premenopausal womenwith psychosis.",RCT,,,,Aripiprazole,Placebo,,,Women with severe mental illness,Prolactin elevation,
Evaluation of in vitro screening and diagnostic kits for hepatitis C virus infection.,/pubmed/29940422,"BACKGROUND: To detect infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV), a reliable kit withhigh sensitivity and specificity is indispensable. Detection kits for anti-HCVantibodies (anti-HCV) are used for screening, and quantification kits for HCV RNAand core antigen are used for definite diagnosis of HCV infection.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the performance of these kits using InternationalStandards and a regional reference panel with HCV negative and positivespecimens.STUDY DESIGN: In vitro diagnostic kits (10 anti-HCV, two HCV RNA, and three HCVcore antigen) were included.RESULTS: Nearly all specimens in the regional reference panel were correctlyidentified by all anti-HCV detection kits (one false-positive was observed in onekit). Both HCV RNA quantification kits also correctly identified and quantifiedHCV RNA titers, without genotype-specific differences. Among the HCV core antigenkits, International Standard values were inconsistent. The sensitivities of thesekits were insufficient to detect HCV in positive specimens in the regionalreference panel.CONCLUSIONS: In vitro diagnostic kits assessing anti-HCV and HCV RNA havesufficient sensitivities and specificities to screen and detect HCV infection.However, HCV core antigen quantification kits have some limitations in theirsensitivities and consistencies for diagnosis of HCV infection. Quality controlwith International Standards and a regional reference panel is important tomaintain the performances of diagnostic kits for HCV infection and to verify the clinical reliability of these kits.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Impact of DAAs on liver transplantation: major effects on the evolution of indications and results. An ELITA study based on the ELTR registry.,/pubmed/29940268,"BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) have dramatically improved theoutcome of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection including those withdecompensated cirrhosis (DC). We analysed the evolution of indications andresults of liver transplantation (LT) in the past 10 years in Europe, focusing onthe changes induced by the advent of the DAA.METHODS: This is a cohort study based on data from the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR). Data of adult LTs performed between January 2007 to June 2017for HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), alcohol (ETOH) and non-alcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH) was analysed. The period was divided into different eras: interferon (IFN/RBV; 2007-2010), protease inhibitor (PI; 2011-2013) and secondgeneration DAA (DAA; 2014-June 2017).RESULTS: Out of a total number of 60,527 LTs, 36,382 were performed in patientswith HCV, HBV, ETOH and NASH. The percentage of LTs due to HCV-related liverdisease varied significantly over time (p<0.0001), decreasing from 22.8% inIFN/RBV era to 17.4% in the DAA era, while those performed for NASH increasedsignificantly (p<0.0001). In the DAA era, the percentage of LTs for HCV decreasedsignificantly (p<0.0001) from 21.1% (first semester 2014) to 10.6% (firstsemester 2017). This decline was more evident in patients with DC (HCV-DC,-58.0%) than in those with HCC associated to HCV (HCV-HCC, -41.2%). Conversely,three-year survival of LT recipients with HCV related liver disease improved from65.1% in the IFN/RBV era to 76.9% in the DAA era, being currently comparable tothe survival of recipients with HBV infection (p=0.3807).CONCLUSIONS: In Europe, the number of LTs due to HCV infection is rapidlydeclining for both HCV-DC and HCV-HCC indications and post-LT survival hasdramatically improved over the last three years. This is the first comprehensive study of the overall impact of DAA treatment for HCV on liver transplantation in Europe.LAY SUMMARY: After the advent of DAAs in 2014, a dramatic decline in the numberof LT performed both in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to HCV, minus60%, and in those with HCC associated to HCV, minus 41%, was observed.Furthermore, this is the first large scale study demonstrating that the survival of LT recipients with HCV related liver disease has dramatically improved overthe last three years, being currently comparable to the survival of recipientswith HBV infection. A positive result from decreased need of LT for HCV relatedindications is greater availability of livers, at least 6oo every year, which maybe allocated to indications other than HCV.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Correlation between PAI-1, leptin and ferritin with HOMA in HIV/AIDS patients.",/pubmed/29940157,"BACKGROUND: Data about correlation of interleukins (IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, monocytechemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF_), ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with homeostasis model assessment(HOMA) in HIV/AIDS patients are still limited. Therefore the aim of this studywas to evaluate the possible correlations of serum levels of PAI-1, leptin andferritin with HOMA in HIV/AIDS patients treated with combined antiretroviraltherapy (cART).METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 64 HIV/AIDS patients, allCaucasians, receiving cART at the HIV/AIDS Centre, Belgrade, Serbia. PAI-1,leptin, ferritin and insulin levels were measured using the Metabolic SyndromeArray I (Randox Laboratories Ltd., London, UK), while adiponectin and resistinlevels were measured using Metabolic Syndrome Array II (Randox Laboratories Ltd.,London, UK), interleukins (IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10),MCP-1, TNF-_ as well as VEGF was measured using Cytokine Array I (RandoxLaboratories Ltd., London, UK). Insulin resistance was determined using thehomeostasis model assessment index (HOMA). Multicollinearity of independentvariables in multivariate model was analyzed using Variance Inflation Factor.RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between HOMA and waist circumference, body mass index, patients' age, number of cART combinations and triglycerides (p_=_0.001, p_=_0.001, p_=_0.050, p_=_0.044, p_=_0.002,respectively). HOMA negatively correlated with levels of high density lipoprotein(HDL) (Rho_=_-0.282; p_=_0.025). PAI-1 (Rho_=_0.334; p_=_0.007) and leptin(Rho_=_0.492; p_=_0.001) together with ferritin (Rho_=_0.396, p_=_0.001)positively and significantly correlated with HOMA. Levels of IL-1 _, IL-1 _, IFN _, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, adiponectin, MCP-1, resistin, TNF-_, CRP andVEGF did not significantly correlate with HOMA. Further, multiple logisticregression showed that there is a statistically significant correlation betweenPAI, leptin and ferritin with HOMA levels (p_=_0.042; p_<_0.001, p_=_0.009).CONCLUSIONS: We showed significant correlation between PAI-1, leptin andferritin, independently of each other with HOMA, in HIV/AIDS patients on cART.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Screening of hepatitis C virus infection in adult general population in Spain.,/pubmed/29939868,"PURPOSE: The aim was to estimate seroprevalence and prevalence of hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) infection in a small health area of the Valencian Community, Spain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study aimed atestimation of HCV infection prevalence in the whole adult population (25-70 yearsold), that is, a pilot study for an eventual population-based screening program.RESULTS: A total of 5849 participants aged 25-70 years (51% male) were invited toparticipate by regular mail. Overall, 143 letters were returned owing to errorsin the addresses. Of 5706 participants, 2637 (46.2%) participated in the study.Rapid test of anti-HCV antibody detection was positive in 30 cases (HCVseroprevalence 1.14%, 95% confidence intervals: 0.73-1.55%). Of those, seven werenot aware of their condition. Participants who had a positive result in the rapidtest of anti-HCV detection were given a confirmatory test by enzyme immune assay,and all had a positive result. RNA-HCV determination by quantitative PCR inpositive anti-HCV patients showed positive viremia in 13 (43.3%) cases, of which five were not aware of the disease. Of the 17 patients who had negative viremia, two were unaware of their HCV status, one was a carrier of anti-HCV and wasalready aware of his condition, and 14 had been previously treated withsatisfactory results. Regarding fibrosis, of the seven patients who were unaware of HCV infection, none of them had significant fibrosis. Moreover, 26 (86.7%)anti-HCV positive patients were reported to have one or more risk factors for HCVinfection.CONCLUSION: HCV screening strategies applied to the general population are goodmeans to diagnose and treat patients who are not aware of their infection,avoiding new transmissions as well as disease progression.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Real-World Clinical Efficacy and Tolerability of Direct-Acting Antivirals in Hepatitis C Monoinfection Compared to Hepatitis C/HIV Coinfection in a Community Care Setting.,/pubmed/29938459,"Background/Aims: Limited data exist comparing the safety and efficacy ofdirect-acting antivirals (DAAs) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfected andHCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected patients in the real-worldclinic practice setting.Methods: All HCV monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected patients treated with DAAsbetween January 2014 and October 2017 in community clinic settings wereretrospectively analyzed. Pretreatment baseline patient characteristics,treatment efficacy, factors affecting sustained virologic response at 12 weeks(SVR 12) after treatment, and adverse reactions were compared between the groups.Results: A total of 327 patients were included in the study, of which 253 wereHCV monoinfected, and 74 were HCV/HIV coinfected. There was a statisticallysignificant difference observed in SVR 12 when comparing HCV monoinfection andHCV/HIV coinfection (94% and 84%, respectively, p=0.005). However, there were no significant factors identified as a predictor of a reduced response. The mostcommon adverse effect was fatigue (27%). No significant drug interaction wasobserved between DAA and antiretroviral therapy. None of the patientsdiscontinued the treatment due to adverse events.Conclusions: In a real-world setting, DAA regimens have lower SVR 12 in HCV/HIVcoinfection than in HCV monoinfection. Further studies involving a higher number of HCV/HIV coinfected patients are needed to identify real predictors of areduced response.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Role of T-Helper 9 Cells in Chronic Hepatitis C-Infected Patients.,/pubmed/29937515,"Hepatitis C virus is a hepatotropic virus that is transmitted parenterally. Viralinfections are usually associated with modulations of the immune cells, leadingto enhanced viral survival and spreading, and accordingly, life-threateningcomplications. Recently, it has been proposed that a new subset of T-helper,named T-helper 9, is involved in the pathogenesis of different immunopathologicalconditions, such as allergies, tumors, and viral infections. Some studiesreported a protective role, and others described a pathogenic potential for theT-helper 9 cells. Here, we present evidence that T-helper 9 cells are dynamicallyincreased with increasing the pathogenic strategy for hepatitis C virus (HCV).Furthermore, viral clearance is associated with a decrease in T-helper 9. Theincrease in T-helper 9 was paralleled with an increase in its receptorexpression. Taken together, our data suggest that T-helper 9 cells play animportant role in the pathogenesis of HCV, and is directly associated withHCV-related complications.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A Comparative Effectiveness Study of Two Nontargeted HIV and Hepatitis C Virus Screening Algorithms in an Urban Emergency Department.,/pubmed/29937238,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the effectiveness of 2 nontargeted HIV and hepatitis C virus screening protocols integrated consecutively into care in an urbanemergency department: a nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithmfollowed by anÊautomated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus screeningalgorithm programmed into the electronic health record.METHODS: This was a before-after comparative effectiveness cohort study. Allpatients aged 18 to 75 years who received treatment during 5-month periods wereeligible for participation. The main outcome measures were the number of patientsscreened and the number with newly diagnosed HIV and hepatitis C virus infection.RESULTS: Of the eligible patients, 6,736 (33.9%) completed HIV screening duringthe automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis CÊvirus screening algorithm, whereas4,121 (19.6%) completed HIV screening during the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis Cvirus screening algorithm (difference 14.3%; 95% confidence interval 13.4% to15.1%); and 6,972 (35.1%) completed hepatitis C virus screening during theautomated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithm, whereas2,968 (14.2%) completed hepatitis C virus screening during the nurse-orderHIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithm (difference 20.9%; 95% confidenceinterval 20.1% to 21.7%). More patients had newly diagnosed HIV (23 versus 17)and hepatitis C virus infection (101 versus 29) during theautomated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithm than thenurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithm. Results were more oftenavailable before discharge (HIV 87.2% versus 65.1%; hepatitis C virus 90.0%versus 65.4%) and fewer patients underwent repeated screening (HIV 1.6% versus5.8%; hepatitis C virus 1.3% versus 4.5%) during the automated-laboratory-orderHIV/hepatitis C virus screening algorithm than the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis Cvirus screening algorithm.CONCLUSION: An electronic health record algorithm that automatically linksHIV/hepatitis C virus screening to laboratory ordering for adult patients is moreeffective than a nurse-driven protocol. With widespread use of electronic health record systems, this model can be easily replicated and should be considered the standard for future programs.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Lack of Association between Oral Lichen Planus and Hepatitis B and C Virus Infection - a Report from Southeast Iran,/pubmed/29936791,"Background: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic autoimmune disease with anunknown etiology. Dentists are usually the first medical practitioners todiagnose this condition although it also affects body parts other than the oralmucosa. Several studies have reported an association between the OLP andhepatitis B and C infections. This study aimed to determine the prevalence ofhepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies inpatients with OLP compared with healthy controls. Methods: In this case_controlstudy, 50 patients with clinical and histopathological characteristics of OLP,and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls supplied serum samples (5 mL) forevaluation by ELISA. Data were analyzed using SPSS Software, version 21.Chi-square test was applied as appropriate. Results: In this study, the 50patients with OLP (33 females and 17 males) had a mean age of 42.0 ± 14.5 years, and the 50 healthy subjects (33 females and 17 males) a mean age of 41.9 ± 13.7years. None demonstrated any evidence of HBV antigen or HCV antibodies.Discussion: We could not detect any association between OLP and viral hepatitis. This could be attributed to a lower prevalence of hepatitis viruses compared toother countries or genotypic variation or other etiological factors contributing in our cases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Ecological drivers of Hepacivirus infection in a neotropical rodent inhabiting landscapes with various degrees of human environmental change.,/pubmed/29936542,"Anthropogenic environmental change can impact community and population traitssuch as species diversity and population densities, which have been shown toinfluence the prevalence of viruses in wildlife reservoirs. In particular, hostspecies resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers,which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapesdiffering in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama andinvestigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. Themodification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitatpatches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity andspecies assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance ofgeneralist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent(Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolatedhabitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system.Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, hostpopulation density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor ofinfection probability. Although we found no significant relationships betweenspecies diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalencedetected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates thatshifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance ofmarsupial predators) impact the host's intraspecific contact rates, theprobability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our studyadditionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitantconsideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors.",N,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested in detecting subclinical CNS involvement in chronic HCV infected subjects with and without systemicvasculitis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients (15 females and 4 males) with chronic HCVinfection (mean age 46.5_±_7 and mean duration since diagnosis of HCV infection4.7_±_4_years, including 6 (32%) Child-Pugh class A cirrhotic patients) and 30age, sex and education matched healthy control subjects were studied. Thirteenpatients had associated vasculitis. Patients and control subjects were assessedusing the block design and comprehension subtests of Wechsler Bellevue AdultIntelligence Scale, Wechsler Memory scale (WMS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) andBeck Depression Inventory (BDI). Brain HMPAO Single Photon Emission ComputedTomography (SPECT) was performed for HCV patients.RESULTS: Patients with HCV had lower scores on the block design test compared to control subjects (8.37_±_1.89 versus 10.37_±_1.47, p_<_0.001), lower total WMSscores (43.15_±_10.49 versus 60.27_±_8.08, p_<_0.001) and higher anxiety anddepression scores (16.94_±_10.46 and 37.17_±_10.38 versus 10.3_±_4.67 and28.9_±_5.99, p_=_0.004 and 0.001, respectively).

Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among high-risk groups in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,/pubmed/29935474,"OBJECTIVES: Determination of the true burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectionamong high-risk groups relies heavily on occurrence measures such as prevalence, which are vital for implementation of preventive action plans. Nevertheless,up-to-date data on the prevalence of HCV infection remain scarce in Iran. Thisstudy aimed to review the relevant literature systematically and determine thepooled prevalence of HCV infection among high-risk groups in Iran.STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review & meta-analysis.METHODS: In 2016, electronic scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Webof Science and local databases were searched using a detailed search strategywith language restricted to English and Farsi. The reference lists of the studiesincluded in this review were also screened. Data were reviewed and extractedindependently by two authors. A random effects model was used to estimate thepooled prevalence. Sources of heterogeneity among the studies were determinedusing subgroup analysis and meta-regression.RESULTS: In total, 1817 records were identified in the initial search, and 46records were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of HCV amonghigh-risk groups was 32.3%. The prevalence was 41.3% in injection drug users(IDUs), 22.9% in prisoners, 16.2% in drug-dependent individuals and 24.6% indrug-dependent prisoners. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed thatgeographical location and year of publication were the probable sources ofheterogeneity.CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found a high prevalence of HCV among high-riskgroups in Iran, particularly among IDUs. There is a need for preventionstrategies to reduce the burden of HCV infection among high-risk groups,particularly IDUs.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Polymorphisms of base-excision repair genes and the hepatocarcinogenesis.,/pubmed/29935355,"Aim To determine the possible association between polymorphisms of DNA repairgenes, including XRCC1 Arg194Tryp, Arg280His, and Arg399Glu, APE1 Asp148Glu, and NEIL2 Arg257Leu, and the risk of developing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-relatedhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).METHODS: A total of 264 subjects were recruited inthis retrospective case-control study and were categorized into four groups: 88control subjects (CR), 53 chronic hepatitis C patients (CHC), 36 liver cirrhotic patients (LC), and 87 HCC patients. The XRCC1 Arg194Tryp, Arg280His, andArg399Glu polymorphisms were detected using PCR-RFLP, while real-time PCR wasused to genotype APE1 Asp148Glu and NEIL2 Arg257Leu.RESULTS: Our data revealed that, compared with the healthy controls, for thosesubjects with the XRCC1 Arg194Trp genotype, the risk of developing CHC, LC, andHCC was increased by 6.66- (odds ratio (OR)_=_6.667; 95% confidence interval(CI)_=_3.244-13.701; P_>_0.01), 3.85- (OR_=_3.852; 95% CI_=_1.797-8.256;P_>_0.01), and 2.14-fold (OR_=_2.14; 95% CI_=_1.13-4.06; P_>_0.05), respectively.There was no association between the risk of HCC development and the XRCC1Arg280His or XRCC1 Arg399Gln genotypes. Moreover, the analysis showed a lack ofassociation between APE1 Asp148Glu and the risk of HCC development. The analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that the HCC patients with the XRCC1Arg280His polymorphism were 2.9 fold more likely to have hepatic lesions in both hepatic lobes (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.15-7.29). Notably, in the HCC patients, theprevalence of the APE1 polymorphism in the males was four times higher than that in the females (OR_=_4; 95% CI_=_1.129-14.175; P_>_0.05).CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism could be arisk factor for HCV-related HCC development in Egypt.",N,,,,,,,,,,
MicroRNA profiles in serum samples from patients with stable cirrhosis and miRNA-21 as a predictor of transplant-free survival.,/pubmed/29935272,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have remarkable potential as diagnostic and prognostic markersbecause of their roles in disease pathogenesis. miRNAs can be released into thebloodstream, where they are sufficiently stable to be detected noninvasively.Here, we prospectively evaluated serum levels of miR-21, miR-34a, miR-122,miR-181b, and miR-885-5p in patients with stable cirrhosis. Total RNA wasextracted from the sera of patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals, andthe expression levels of the target miRNAs were analyzed by reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum miRNAs levels werecorrelated with liver function parameters, etiology, and complications ofcirrhosis. Circulating miR-34a, miR-122, and miR-885-5p levels were higher inpatients with cirrhosis than in healthy individuals. These miRNAs were positivelycorrelated with alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels,and the relative expression levels were higher in hepatitis C virus-infectedpatients and lower in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. miR-122 andmiR-885-5p levels were also positively correlated with _-glutamyl transpeptidase concentrations. miR-21 was associated with transplant-free survival in univariateCox regression analysis and remained independently associated with survival afteradjustment for age, Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, and history of previous decompensation in multivariate Cox regressionanalysis. These data suggested that miR-34a, miR-122, and miR-885-5p levels maybemore related to the inflammatory process and ongoing hepatocyte damage inpatients with cirrhosis. Moreover, miR-21 levels were independently associatedwith shorter transplant-free survival and may be used as a prognostic tool inoutpatients with stable cirrhosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Should we cure HCV in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma while treating cancer?,/pubmed/29935096,"Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) stabilize or improve liver function in themajority of patients with HCV cirrhosis. Hepatic decompensation is the maindriver of death of patients with early, successfully treated HCC superimposed to cirrhosis. Treatment with DAAs could improve the prognosis of these subjects,independently from the subsequent course of HCC, if the efficacy in obtainingviral clearance is as high as in patients without a history of HCC, and if therisk of HCC recurrence is unaffected. When dealing with HCC patients, DAAs can beindicated in two different settings: a) subjects in which HCC has been alreadysuccessfully treated (""cured"" HCC), or b) subjects whose HCC is still untreatedor untreatable (""active"" HCC). While there are abundant data on ""cured"" HCC,evidence supporting treatment decisions in patients with ""active"" HCC is at best scarce and controversial, since these patients as well as patients with HCClisted for liver transplantation (LT) are usually excluded from treatment.

Longitudinal assessment of hepatic fibrosis in responders to direct-acting antivirals for recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation using noninvasive methods.,/pubmed/29935046,"Successful eradication of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection followingliver transplantation (HCV) improves graft survival. The current study aimed atevaluation of hepatic fibrosis changes among long term responders to DAAs therapyfor recurrent HCV after liver transplantation using noninvasive methods. Patientswith significant hepatic fibrosis (³F2) who achieved SVR12 after treatment withDAAs for recurrent HCV were included (n=52). Hepatic fibrosis status wasassessed, non-invasively, by calculation of fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) andaspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio (APRI) index and by measurement ofgraft stiffness using FibroScan at baseline and 12- and 18-months post-treatment.Acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) was done for all patients 12- and18-months post-treatment. Patients were classified into 2 groups based onbaseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan; significant fibrosis(F2; n=28) and advanced fibrosis groups (³ F3). Over 18 months follow up period, there was serial improvement of FIB-4, APRI index, and LSM by FibroScan in bothgroups. Higher baseline LSM and delayed initiation of antiviral therapy weresignificant predictors of lack of fibrosis regression (p-value 0.01 and 0.04respectively).

The prevalence of HCV among healthcare workers (HCWs) is higher than normal population. Our aim is to determine theseroprevalence of HCV among this high-risk group in Damascus Hospital, Syria in2016.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During March 2016, anonymous testing for HCV was offered to150 residents and physicians from different departments (Surgery, otolaryngology,gastroenterology, anaesthesiology and laboratory) in Damascus Hospital usingfourth-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, eachparticipant was interviewed and answered a comprehensive questionnaire whichincludes questions on potential hazards, risk factors and the level of awareness about the disease and its ways of transmission.RESULTS: Surprisingly, all samples tested negative for anti-HCV antibodies,though many participants were already exposed to many risk factors especially as HCWs.CONCLUSION: HCV is not a main issue regarding its prevalence among HCWs inDamascus Hospital.

miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 are Promising Biomarkers for Progression of Liver Fibrosis in HCV Egyptian Patients.,/pubmed/29932949,"BACKGROUND: Current methodologies used to determine the progression of hepaticfibrosis rely heavily on liver biopsy, a dangerous and invasive procedure, withsemi-subjective analysis of the results of the biopsy. Thus, a new approach isimmensely needed for monitoring the progression of liver fibrosis in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients.AIM OF WORK: The purpose of this study was to find highly specific and sensitive miRNA biomarkers that can be used to detect different stages of liver fibrosis.METHODOLOGY: The study consisted of 42 cases of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) withearly-stage fibrosis, 45 cases of CHC with late-stage fibrosis, and 40 healthysubjects with no CHC or fibrosis as controls. Expression patterns of 5 miRNAs(miR-16, miR-146a, miR-214-5p, miR-221, and miR-222) were analyzed in each group using TaqMan real-time PCR.RESULTS: Serum levels of miRNA-16, miRNA-146a, miRNA-221, and miRNA-222 were all significantly up-regulated in early and late stages of liver fibrosis. miRNA-222 had the highest sensitivity and specificity values in early and late fibrosis.miRNA-221 had the second highest sensitivity and specificity with the late-stage fibrosis group. Furthermore, miRNA-221 showed significant positive correlationswith both miRNA-16 and miRNA-146a in the early- and late-stage fibrosis groups,with the early stage having a stronger correlation.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that miRNA-16, miRNA-146a, miRNA-221, andmiRNA-222 can be used to detect the presence of liver fibrosis. The highsensitivity and specificity of miRNA-222 and miRNA-221 in late-stage fibrosisindicate promising prognostic biomarkers for HCV-induced liver fibrosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Human Oncoviruses and p53 Tumor Suppressor Pathway Deregulation at the Origin of Human Cancers.,/pubmed/29932446,"Viral oncogenesis is a multistep process largely depending on the complexinterplay between viruses and host factors. The oncoviruses are capable ofsubverting the cell signaling machinery and metabolic pathways and exploit themfor infection, replication, and persistence. Several viral oncoproteins are able to functionally inactivate the tumor suppressor p53, causing deregulatedexpression of many genes orchestrated by p53, such as those involved inapoptosis, DNA stability, and cell proliferation. The Epstein_Barr virus (EBV)BZLF1, the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6, and the hepatitis C virus(HCV) NS5 proteins have shown to directly bind to and degrade p53. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) HBx and the human T cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) Tax proteinsinhibit p53 activity through the modulation of p300/CBP nuclear factors, whilethe Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (HHV8) LANA, vIRF-1 and vIRF-3 proteins havebeen shown to destabilize the oncosuppressor, causing a decrease in its levels inthe infected cells. The large T antigen of the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)does not bind to p53 but significantly reduces p53-dependent transcription. This review describes the main molecular mechanisms involved in the interactionbetween viral oncoproteins and p53-related pathways as well as in the developmentof therapeutic strategies targeting such interactions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
In vivo evidence that the cannabinoid receptor 2-63 RR variant is associated with the acquisition and/or expansion of HIV infection.,/pubmed/29932291,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether the rs35761398variants of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) gene may influence the acquisitionof HIV infection and the clinical presentation of HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)coinfection.METHODS: We compared 166 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with 186 HCV-monoinfectedpatients, all with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis (using the Ishak scoringsystem), nave for anti-HCV treatment and tested for the CB2 rs35761398polymorphism (using the TaqMan assay).RESULTS: The HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were more frequently male (PÊ<Ê0.002),were younger (PÊ<Ê0.001), and had lower median BMI (PÊ<Ê0.001) and HCV RNA(PÊ<Ê0.05) and higher median aspartate aminotransferase (AST; PÊ<Ê0.001), alanineaminotransferase (ALT; PÊ<Ê0.001) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT; PÊ<Ê0.001)levels than the HCV-monoinfected patients. The CB2 RR variant predominated inHIV/HCV-coinfected patients (45.8% vs. 31.2% in HCV-monoinfected patients;PÊ<Ê0.001) and the CB2 QR variant in HCV-monoinfected patients (57.5% vs. 38.6%in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients; PÊ<Ê0.00001), and the CB2 QQ variant was equally distributed.

Risk factors for recurrences in patients with hepatitis C virus after achieving a sustained virological response: a multicentre study from Turkey.,/pubmed/29932085,"In this study, we aimed to determine the late relapse rate in hepatitis Cpatients with sustained virological response after interferon-based regimens, andevaluated the predictors of late relapse while comparing the real-life data ofour country with that of others. A multicenter retrospective study was performed to investigate the data of patients infected with HCV who obtained sustainedvirological response after classical or pegylated interferon alpha (PegIFN_) and ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks. Sustained virological response was based onnegative HCV RNA level by PCR at the end of six months after the therapy. Theinformation of patients enrolled in the study was retrieved from the hospitalcomputer operating system and outpatient follow-up archives. We evaluated theage, gender, HCV RNA levels, HCV genotype, six-month and further follow-up ofpatients with sustained virologic response, presence of cirrhosis, steatosis and relapse. In all, 606 out of 629 chronic hepatitis C patients (mean age was 53±12 years; 57.6% of them were female) with sustained virological response wereevaluated. We excluded 23 patients who relapsed within six months after the endof treatment (EOT). The mean follow-up period of the patients was 71 months(range: 6-136) after therapy. Late relapse rate was 1.8% (n=11) in all patients. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models identified that cirrhosisand steatosis were associated with the late relapse [(p = 0.027; Hazard Ratio(HR) 2.328; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.309-80.418), (p = 0.021; HR 1.446;95% CI: 1.243-14.510, respectively]. In multivariable Cox regression analysis,steatosis was the only independent risk factor for late relapse (p = 0.03; HR3.953; 95% CI: 1.146-13.635). Although the late relapse rate was approximately 2%in our study, clinicians should consider that pretreatment steatosis may be animportant risk factor for late relapse.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Estimating the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in New York City, 2015.",/pubmed/29932040,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-borneinfection in the USA. Estimating prevalence is critical for monitoring diagnosis,treatment, and cure and for allocating resources.

The numbers who died, out-migrated or whose last RNAtest was negative were removed from the count of people reported with HCV. Asimulation model was used to remove estimates of people whose infectionspontaneously cleared or was cured and to add an estimate of people unaware ofinfection. The surveillance-based HCV prevalence in NYC in 2015 overall was 1.4% (95% certainty level (CL) 1.2-1.6%; n Å 116 000, 95% CL Å99 000-135 000) andamong adults aged _20 years was 1.8% (95% CL 1.5-2.0%, n Å 115 000, 95% CL Å99000-134 000), lower than the 2010 estimate among adults aged _20 years of 2.4% (nÅ 147 000).

Liver transplantation in hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease type 3: perioperative management and post-transplant outcome.,/pubmed/29931985,"INTRODUCTION: infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes significantmorbidity and mortality in patients with hemophilia. Finally, patients areconsidered for a liver transplantation (LT) due to cirrhosis and/orhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MATERIAL AND METHODS: we report the cases of congenital coagulopathy and HCVinfection that underwent LT in our institution. There were three patients withhemophilia A and one patient with von Willebrand disease (vWD) type 3. Thecoagulopathy outcome, perioperative management, factor and blood product usageand post-transplant survival were assessed. The deficient factor was initiallyadministered in a direct bolus one hour before surgery with a target level of 100IU/dl, which was sustained until stable hemostasis was reached.RESULTS: all three patients with hemophilia A were cured of their coagulopathyfollowing transplantation. Factor VIII (FVIII) was 93 IU/dl at eleven years, 59IU/dl at 13 months and 109 IU/dl at nine months post-transplant, in each case.The mean perioperative usage of FVIII concentrates was 175 IU/kg; concentrateswere infused for an average of 36 hours post-transplant. The natural course ofthe bleeding symptoms of the patient with type-3 vWD was attenuated, with nodetectable hemostatic levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) aftertransplantation.CONCLUSIONS: after transplantation, hemophilia A cure and improved bleedingphenotype of type-3 vWD reduced morbidity and mortality.

"Depression, fatigue and neurocognitive deficits in chronic hepatitis C.",/pubmed/29931590,"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection experience a range ofsymptoms including depression, fatigue and neurocognitive deficits, impairingquality of life. Depression, in particular, may be reactive to increasedpsychosocial stress, and the physical symptoms of advanced HCV or associatedcomorbidities. However, even patients at an early stage of HCV infection, withminimal hepatic inflammation or comorbidities, report more depressive symptomsand fatigue than the general population. Similarly, specific neurocognitivedeficits occur in early stage HCV infection and are independent of the presenceof depression or encephalopathy. Therefore, intracerebral neurobiological changesassociated with HCV may potentially explain these symptoms. These changes mayarise from infiltration of the brain by peripherally induced cytokines, as wellas direct neuropathic effects of HCV viral particles penetrating the blood-brain barrier. These phenomena parallel those reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HCV-associated intracerebral changes include upregulatedinflammatory responses, altered neurotransmitter levels, hormonal dysregulation, and release of neurotoxic substances. These may subsequently lead to abnormalneuronal conduction and function in areas of the brain governing affectiveresponses, emotional processing, motivation, attention and concentration.Although direct-acting antiviral medications lead to high rates of HCV clearance,intracerebral changes may not be subsequently reversed and symptoms ofdepression, fatigue and neurocognitive deficits may persist. There is an ongoing role for multidisciplinary care and pharmacotherapy to manage these symptoms inHCV patients. Furthermore, there may be opportunities for future therapies tospecifically target and ameliorate HCV-associated intracerebral changes.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Both groups were followed until diagnosis with BD, withdrawal from thenational health insurance program, or the end of 2011. Patients with viralhepatitis were grouped into 3 cohorts: HBV infection, HCV infection, and HBV/HCV coinfection. The association between viral hepatitis and BD were examined usingCox proportional hazards regression models.RESULTS: The incidence of BD was higher in HBV/HCV coinfection than in thecontrol group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.16 (95% confidence interval1.06-4.41) when adjusted for sex, age, and comorbidity. After further adjustment,we noted that an age more than 65Êyears and female may be associated with anincreased risk of BD in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C.CONCLUSION: Viral hepatitis may be associated with increased risk of subsequentBD.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Strategies for Improving Hepatitis C Treatment Access in the United States: State Officials Address High Drug Prices, Stigma, and Building Treatment Capacity.",/pubmed/29927900,"CONTEXT: Curative treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) can alter the course of a devastating epidemic, but high drug prices have contributed to restrictions on HCV treatment access.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to learn how state health agencies have responded to thechallenges of treatment access for HCV.DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured key informant interviews focusedon aspects of HCV treatment access between June 2016 and March 2017. Contentanalysis was used to identify dominant themes.SETTING: United States.PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen health officials and treatment advocates across 6 statesselected using purposive sampling.RESULTS: Drug pricing is the most important barrier to access, encouragingrestrictive authorization criteria from payers that in turn discourage providers from offering treatment. However, payers have not experienced the budget impactthat was initially feared. Although authorization criteria are being lifted forfee-for-service Medicaid programs, ensuring that managed care organizationsfollow suit remains a challenge. The effect of stigma, a shortage of treatingproviders, and lack of political motivation are additional challenges toexpanding treatment. The response to the human immunodeficiency virus epidemiccan augment or inform strategies for HCV treatment delivery, but this is limited by the absence of dedicated funding.CONCLUSIONS: While treatment eligibility criteria for HCV treatment areimproving, many other barriers remain to achieving the scale-up needed to end theepidemic. Political disinterest, stigma, and a lack of specialty providers arecontinued barriers in some jurisdictions. States may need to invest in strategiesto overcome these barriers, such as engaging in public and provider education andensuring that treatment by primary care providers is reimbursed. Despiteuncertainty about how federal policy changes to Medicaid may affect states'ability to respond, states can identify opportunities to improve access.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Ribavirin-induced mutagenesis across the complete open reading frame of hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a and 3a.,/pubmed/29927371,"Ribavirin (RBV) has been used for the last 20 years to treat patients withchronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This pluripotent drug is believed toinduce mutagenesis in HCV RNA. However, for cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) thisphenomenon has only been investigated in genotype 2a recombinants. Here westudied the mutations that developed in HCVcc of genotypes 1a and 3a treated withRBV or ribavirin triphosphate (RBV-TP) compared to non-treated controls. Analysiswas performed on the amplified full-length open reading frame (ORF) of recovered viruses following next-generation sequencing and clonal analyses. Compared tonon-treated controls, the spread of TNcc(1a) and DBN3acc(3a) HCVcc was delayed byRBV and RBV-TP at concentrations of 40_µM or higher. The delay in HCVcc spreadwas associated with increased new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).Significantly higher numbers of new SNP were observed in TNcc(1a) viruses treatedwith RBV or RBV-TP compared to matched non-treated controls. RBV or RBV-TPtreatment led to significantly increased proportions of new G-to-A and C-to-U SNPcompared to non-treated TNcc(1a). Clonal analyses confirmed a significantlyincreased mutation rate in RBV-treated TNcc(1a). Synonymous pairwise distancesincreased in both viruses across the complete ORF under RBV and RBV-TP treatment compared to controls. Consensus-shifts in single samples of RBV- orRBV-TP-treated TNcc(1a) viruses occurred in proteins E1, p7, NS3 and NS4B. Nonon-synonymous consensus changes were observed in DBN3acc(3a). This studysupports a biased G-to-A and C-to-U mutagenic effect of RBV and RBV-TP throughoutthe entire ORF of HCV genotypes 1a and 3a.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection and the IL28B genotype polymorphism among blood donors and high-risk populations.,/pubmed/29926111,"INTRODUCTION: To study the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infection inblood donor (BD), haemodialysis (HD) and intravenous drug user (IVDU) populationsin Singapore and assess the IL28B polymorphism if HCV positive.METHODS: The BD population were healthy volunteers, the HD population werepatients who were on haemodialysis for at least 6 months of follow-up between Jan2009 and Dec2014. IVDU population was from inmates at half-way houses whoconsented.RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2014, of 161,658 individuals screened for blooddonation, 42 (0.059%) were positive for HCV. Common genotype (GT) were GT-3(47.6%) and GT-1 (31%). Of 1,575 HD patients 2.2% were anti-HCV positive. The HCVGT distribution was GT-1 (32.3%), GT-3 (20.5%) and GT-6 (8.8%). 83 halfway house inmates were screened. Of the 47 IVDU, 36.2% were anti-HCV positive withpredominant GT-3 (%). IL28B polymorphism was noted to be CC predominantly 85.3%.CONCLUSION: Prevalence of HCV infection has decreased in both the BD and HDpopulation. However it remains high in IVDU population. GT-1 remains the mostcommon in the HD population; however, GT-3 infection is now more common among theBD population in Singapore.

A naturally occurring antiviral ribonucleotide encoded by the human genome.,/pubmed/29925952,"Viral infections continue to represent major challenges to public health, and an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the processes that contribute to viral lifecycles is necessary for the development of new therapeutic strategies 1 .Viperin, a member of the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) superfamily ofenzymes, is an interferon-inducible protein implicated in the inhibition ofreplication of a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, including dengue virus, WestNile virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus, rabies virus 2 and HIV3,4.Viperin has been suggested to elicit these broad antiviral activities throughinteractions with a large number of functionally unrelated host and viralproteins3,4. Here we demonstrate that viperin catalyses the conversion ofcytidine triphosphate (CTP) to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), apreviously undescribed biologically relevant molecule, via a SAM-dependentradical mechanism. We show that mammalian cells expressing viperin andmacrophages stimulated with IFN_ produce substantial quantities of ddhCTP. Wealso establish that ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependentRNAÊpolymerases from multiple members of the Flavivirus genus, and show thatddhCTP directly inhibits replication of Zika virus in vivo. These findingssuggest a partially unifying mechanism for the broad antiviral effects of viperinthat is based on the intrinsic enzymatic properties of the protein and involvesthe generation of a naturally occurring replication-chain terminator encoded bymammalian genomes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
High prevalence of a variety of autoantibodies in a population of hepatitis C virus-infected individuals.,/pubmed/29924449,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been related to self-reactivity,extrahepatic manifestations and autoimmune diseases. The main goals of this work were to study the prevalence of autoantibodies and their relationship with viral titers and biochemical markers of hepatic damage in patients infected with HCV.Autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, SMA, APC, LKM, DNAds, ANCA, ATG and RF) were determinedin 73 individuals with chronic HCV infection and 44 healthy volunteers. Thepresence of these antibodies was related to demographic variables, viral titersand biochemical parameters. A high prevalence of autoantibodies, particularly forRF, that was associated with female gender was observed in HCV-infected patients.In addition, SMA, ANA and ATG showed increased frequencies in HCV infection.Interestingly, the concurrent detection of SMA and more than one autoantibody wasassociated with high gGT levels. Notably, concurrent higher gGT, HCV and SMAlevels were observed in male patients as compared to their female counterparts.These results indicate a relationship between HCV infection and the concurrentdetection of various autoantibodies in the absence of symptoms of autoimmunediseases. They also suggest a link among the presence of a variety ofautoantibodies simultaneously with SMA, increased gGT levels and HCV titers in a population of male patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Significance of pSmad2/3 and Smad4 in hepatitis C virus-related liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.,/pubmed/29924446,"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major public health problem, especially in Egypt. Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development increases as hepatitis C virus(HCV)-related liver diseases progress.

This study aims toassess hepatic expression of pSmad2/3 and Smad4 in CHC with different stages offibrosis and grades of necro-inflammation as well as in HCC on top of CHC. Thisstudy was done on 33 core liver biopsies from patients with CHC (15 with earlyfibrosis and 18 with late fibrosis), 15 liver specimens from HCC cases on top of CHC, as well as five normal controls. pSmad2/3 and Smad4 show moreimmunopositivity, higher percentage of positive hepatocytes and stronger stainingintensity in CHC with late fibrosis compared to early fibrosis. pSmad2/3 showsincrease of the previous parameters in CHC with high grade activity than thosewith low activity. Smad4 shows increase of the previous parameters in HCCcompared to CHC cases. pSmad2/3 and Smad4 can be used as diagnostic and/orprognostic markers for progression of HCV-related fibrosis to cirrhosis andfurther progression to HCC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation of the role of GBF1 in the replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.,/pubmed/29923822,"BF1 has emerged as a host factor required for the replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of different families, but its mechanism of action isstill unknown. GBF1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf familymembers. Recently, we identified Arf4 and Arf5 (class II Arfs) as host factorsrequired for the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a GBF1-dependent virus. To assess whether a GBF1/class II Arf pathway is conserved among positive-sensesingle-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated yellow fever virus (YFV), Sindbisvirus (SINV), coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Wefound that GBF1 is involved in the replication of these viruses. However, usingsiRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, it was seen that the depletion of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4 or Arf5 had no impact on viral replication. In contrast, the depletion ofArf pairs suggested that class II Arfs could be involved in HCoV-229E, YFV andSINV infection, as for HCV, but not in CVB4 infection. In addition, another Arfpair, Arf1 and Arf4, appears to be essential for YFV and SINV infection, but not for infection by other viruses. Finally, CVB4 infection was not inhibited by any combination of Arf depletion. We conclude that the mechanism of action of GBF1 inviral replication appears not to be conserved, and that a subset ofpositive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from different families might require class II Arfs for their replication.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Impact of Individual Patient Data in a Network Meta Analysis: An investigation into parameter estimation and model selection.,/pubmed/29923679,"The use of Individual Patient Data (IPD) in Network Meta Analysis (NMA) isbecoming increasingly popular. However, as most studies do not report IPD, mostNMAs are carried out using aggregate data (AD) for at least some, if not all, of the studies. We investigate the benefits of including varying proportions of IPD studies in an NMA. Several models have previously been developed for includingboth AD and IPD in the same NMA. We carried out a simulation study based on thesemodels to examine the impact of additional IPD studies on the accuracy andprecision of the estimates of both the treatment effect and the covariate effect.We also compared the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) between models toassess model fit. An increased proportion of IPD resulted in more accurate andprecise estimates for most models and datasets. However, the coverage probabilitysometimes decreased when the model was misspecified. The use of IPD leads togreater differences in DIC, which allows us choose the correct model more often. We analysed a Hepatitis C network consisting of three IPD observational studies. The ranking of treatments remained the same for all models and datasets. Weobserved similar results to the simulation study: the use of IPD leads todifferences in DIC and more precise estimates for the covariate effect. However, IPD sometimes increased the posterior SD of the treatment effect estimate, which may indicate between study heterogeneity. We recommend that IPD should be usedwhere possible, especially for assessing model fit.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement of Hepatic and Extrahepatic Complications from Chronic Hepatitis C After Antiviral Treatment: A Retrospective Analysis of German Sickness Fund Data.,/pubmed/29923034,"INTRODUCTION: German data regarding the economic burden of chronic hepatitis C(CHC) and potential benefits of CHC treatment are limited. To address this issue,we evaluated the role of treatment in mitigating the economic burden of hepaticand extrahepatic complications (EHCs) from CHC virus infection in Germany.METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study used claims data from theBetriebskrankenkasse German sickness fund (2007-2014) to assess the medical costsof hepatic complications and EHCs, including conditions that are prevalent andbehavioral factors associated with CHC. All-cause costs, medical costs related tohepatic and EHCs, and CHC-related and non-CHC-related pharmacy costs (adjusted tothe 2016 euro rate) were calculated and compared between CHC patients' treated(n_=_1714) and untreated time (n_=_7124) and CHC patients that initiatedtreatment early (i.e., without cirrhosis; n_=_1552) vs. late (i.e., withcirrhosis; n_=_162).RESULTS: CHC treatment was associated with an average adjusted savings of Û1885in annual all-cause medical costs per patient, with a significant proportionattributed to EHC-related cost savings (adjusted difference, Û1363; P_<_0.01).Although initiating CHC treatment early was economically beneficial compared withinitiating treatment late, the total cost savings were not significantlydifferent (annual average adjusted difference, Û3831; P_=_0.27). However, nearly 60% of these savings were EHC related (adjusted difference, Û2255; P_<_0.01).CONCLUSION: CHC is associated with a significant economic burden in Germany,largely due to EHCs.

Cost of illness of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan: A time trend and future projections.,/pubmed/29920556,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of death inJapan. The aim of this study was to calculate the social burden of HCC using the cost of illness (COI) method, and to identify the key factors driving changes in the economic burden of HCC.METHODS: Utilizing government-based statistical nationwide data, the cost ofillness (COI) method was used to estimate the COI for 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005,2008, and 2014 to make predictions for 2017, 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2029. The COI comprised direct and indirect costs (morbidity and mortality costs) of HCC.RESULTS: From 1996 to 2014, COI trended downward. In 2014, COI (579.2 billionJPY) was 0.71 times greater than that in 1996 (816.2 billion JPY). Mortalitycosts accounted for more than 70% of total COI and were a major contributingfactor to the decrease in COI. It was predicted that COI would continue adownward trend until 2029, and that the rate of decline would be similar.CONCLUSIONS: COI of HCC has been decreasing since 1996. Treatment of patientsinfected with hepatitis C virus using newly introduced technologies has hightherapeutic effectiveness, and will affect the future prevalence of HCC. Thesepolicies and technologies may accelerate the downward tendency of COI, and therelative economic burden of HCC is likely to continue to decrease.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Prevalence and Treatment of Untypable HCV Variants in Different Districts of Punjab, Pakistan.",/pubmed/29920175,"In Pakistan, around 11 million people are infected with, at least, sixcirculating genotypes and subtypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The viral burdenis still on rise. HCV genotype determination is necessary to devise appropriateantiviral therapy. Previous reports highlight the prevalence circulatinguntypable (in diagnostic perspectives) HCV subtype in local Pakistani patients.Present study was designed to investigate the epidemiological distribution ofgenotypes in different districts of Punjab, Pakistan and focuses on prevalence ofdiagnostically untypable subtype and its possible antiviral therapy. A total of8,353 HCV patients were included through 2011 to 2016 for determination of HCVprevalent genotypes in the local community. HCV genotyping was carried out using Ohno et al. method, and five cases of diagnostically untypable patients weretreated with interferon-based antiviral regimen to find the possible treatmentstrategy. Of the 8,353 patients, the genotype 3a (n_=_6,650, 79.6%) was mostsignificantly prevalent throughout the study period followed by undeterminedgenotype that is, untypable (n_=_1,377, 16.5%). The presence of untypablevariants suggested that there are some novel or quasi species prevailing amongHCV patients in local community. Five HCV patients infected with untypablegenotype had been treated effectively with interferon alpha plus ribavirintherapy for 24 weeks at standard doses and achieved sustained virologicalresponse. This study highlighted an important aspect of HCV treatment for localPakistani HCV patients. Untypable HCV variants could be treated withinterferon-based antiviral regimens such as 3a genotype. The study raises theneed of characterization of diagnostically untypable HCV variant. On the basis ofthese results, it can be proposed that until the availability of pangenotypicdirect-acting antiviral for HCV treatment in Pakistan, interferon-based antiviralregimens will be of choice for majority of patients infected with 3a or untypablegenotypes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 Genes in Interferon-Treated and Direct-Acting Antiviral Drugs-Treated Hepatitis C Patients.,/pubmed/29920131,"Genetics of host plays a significant role in susceptibility and pathogenesis ofdisease. During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HCV proteins interfere withinterferon (IFN) signaling pathways and upregulate transcription of suppressor ofcytokine signaling 1 and 3 genes (SOCS1 and SOCS3), which results in impairedimmune response. In this study, we evaluated relative expression of SOCS1 andSOCS3 in untreated HCV patients and patients treated with 2 different treatmentstrategies that are, (IFN therapy and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug regimen.To study gene expression, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) wereisolated by using Histopaque. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs by using BIOzol.Nine microgram of total RNA from each sample was used and reverse transcribedinto single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) by using M-MLV reversetranscriptase (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was diluted to a finalconcentration of 500_ng/_L. This diluted cDNA was further used for expressionanalysis of SOCS1and SOCS3 genes using Rotor Gene Q Real-Time PCR DetectionSystem (QIAGEN). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplifiedas a housekeeping gene. We found that the SOCS1 expression in IFN and DAA-treatedpatient groups was 5.4 fold and 1.2 fold, respectively, high compared with thehealthy controls (IFN versus healthy, P_=_0.019 and DAA versus healthy,P_=_0.91), whereas the SOCS3 expression in IFN and DAA-treated patient groups was3.7 fold and 2 fold, respectively, high in comparison with the expression inhealthy controls (IFN versus healthy, P_=_0.025 and DAA versus healthy,P_=_0.03).

DCV/ASV treatment successfully eliminatedthe virus in DAA-nave-patient HCV-infected mice. DCV/ASV treatment failureHCV-infected mice developed viral breakthrough during DCV/ASV treatment, with theemergence of NS5A-L31V/Y93H HCV resistance-associated variants (RAVs) beingobserved by direct sequencing. DCV/ASV/BCV treatment inhibited viral breakthroughin NS5A-L31V/Y93H-mutated HCV-infected mice, but HCV relapsed with the emergence of NS5B-P495S variants after the cessation of the treatment. The efficacy of the triple therapy was also analysed in HCV-infected patients; one DAA-nave patient and four prior DAA treatment failures were treated with 12_weeks of DCV/ASV/BCVtherapy. Sustained virological response was achieved in a DAA-nave patient andone of the DCV/ASV treatment failures through DCV/ASV/BCV therapy; however, HCVrelapse occurred in the other patients with prior DCV/ASV and/orsofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatment failures. DCV/ASV/BCV therapy seems to havelimited efficacy for patients with NS5A RAVs for whom prior DAA treatment hasfailed.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Approaches to manage 'affordability' of high budget impact medicines in key EU countries.,/pubmed/29915664,"Background:ÊThe launch of hepatitis C (HCV) drugs such as sofosbuvir orledipasvir has fostered the question of affordability of novel high budget impacttherapies even in countries with high domestic product. European countries havedeveloped a variety of mechanisms to improve affordability of such therapies,including 'affordability thresholds', price volume agreements or caps onindividual product sales, and special budgets for innovative drugs. While some ofthese mechanisms may help limit budget impact, there are still significantprogresses to be made in the definition and implementation of approaches toensure affordability, especially in health systems where the growth potential in drug spending and/or in the patient contribution to health insurance arelimited.ÊObjectives:ÊIn this article, we will review how seven countries inwestern Europe are approaching the question of affordability of novel therapiesand are developing approaches to continue to reward new sciences while limitingbudget impact. We will also discuss the question of affordability ofcost-effective but hugely expensive therapies and the implications for payers andfor the pharmaceutical industry. Results:ÊThere is clearly not one solution that is used consistently across countries but rather a number of 'tools' that arecombined differently in each country. This illustrates the difficulty of managingaffordability within different legal frameworks and within different health care system architectures.",N,,,,,,,,,,
An unfortunate failure: multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic patient with chronic hepatitis C treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.,/pubmed/29915662,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and is thethird highest cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Risk factors include chronicliver disease and cirrhosis of various causes including chronic hepatitis B andC. In cases of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), HCC usually does not manifestunless the liver has become cirrhotic. Fortunately, novel treatments forhepatitis C including ledipasvir/sofosbuvir can cure patients from their disease and as a result, may never develop cirrhosis and therefore, be at much lower riskof developing HCC. We present a patient with chronic HCV genotype 1a who wassuccessfully treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with documented sustained viralresponse, but 6Êmonths later was found to have multifocal HCC with virusreactivation with no evidence of cirrhosis on imaging or biochemical testing.While novel antiviral agents for HCV lead to >90% cure rate, cure is defined assustained viral response of only 12Êweeks. This brings to light a new patientpopulation who may require further follow-up than 3Êmonths to ensure viralclearance. Furthermore, this patient developed HCC despite initial viralclearance and no evidence of cirrhosis, indicating possible oncogenic potentialof HCV that is independent of cirrhosis that necessitates further investigation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Is 6 months of bedaquiline enough? Results from the compassionate use of bedaquiline in Armenia and Georgia.,/pubmed/29914602,"BACKGROUND AND SETTING: Bedaquiline (BDQ) was initially only available throughcompassionate use programmes.OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of multidrug-resistanttuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment containing BDQ.METHOD: Retrospective analysis of data from patients receiving BDQ throughcompassionate use in Armenia and Georgia from April 2013 to April 2015. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk factors associated with unsuccessfultreatment outcomes.RESULTS: Of 82 patients included, 84.2% (69/82) had fluoroquinolone-resistantMDR-TB and 43.4% (23/53) were seropositive for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Theculture conversion rate was 84.4% (54/64), and 18.5% (10/54) reverted back topositive. In total, 79.3% (65/82) of the patients reported at least one adverseevent. Serious adverse events were reported in 14 patients, with 10/14 patientsexperiencing fatal outcomes-6/10 related to advanced TB and 2/10 assessed aspossibly related to BDQ. Treatment outcomes were as follows: 58.5% treatmentsuccess, 12.2% deaths, 7.3% failures and 21.9% lost to follow-up. HCV coinfectionwas associated with unsuccessful outcomes (adjusted OR 4.45, 95%CI 1.23-16.13).CONCLUSION: BDQ through compassionate use showed relatively good success ratesand safety profiles in a cohort with difficult-to-treat MDR-TB. High rates ofreversion may indicate that >24 weeks of BDQ is necessary in some cases. HCVcoinfection should be diagnosed and treatment considered in MDR-TB patients.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Assessing the level of knowledge and available sources of information about hepatitis C infection among HCV-infected Egyptians.,/pubmed/29914434,"BACKGROUND: Egypt has the largest proportion of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectionworldwide and there is an urgent need to increase community awareness andknowledge about the disease in the country. The main aim of this study was toassess the level of knowledge and awareness about HCV in clinically diagnosed HCVpatients in Egypt.METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted between 1February 2014 and 30 April 2014 in Cairo, Egypt using validated questionnaire as an instrument for data collection. A structured questionnaire was developed basedon similar published surveys. Data collected included demographiccharacteristics, exposure to the disease, health insurance status, the source of medical information, and knowledge of different routes of transmission; a pointwas given for each correct answer with a possible score of 0 to 12.RESULTS: A total of 203 patients took part in this study with a response rate of 90%. Most-142 (70%)-were married, 119 (63%) were unemployed, 127 (62.9%) wereaged above 50Êyears, 88 (45.1%) were living in Cairo, and 45 (22.4%) had acollege degree. Half of the participants believed that HCV infection is nottransmitted through sex, while 79 (39.9%) did not know that HCV could betransmitted from a mother to her infant during labor. A quarter of participantsbelieved that HCV vaccine is available, and 45 (24.6%) never knew if theirtreatment was successful. The median knowledge score of HCV infection in thesurvey was 7.5; 100 (50.3%) participants had ² median knowledge score of HCVinfection. Logistic regression analysis showed a duration of infection (OR 1.647,CI 1.189-2.82) and the participants who visited physicians when only they feltsick were less likely to have the above median knowledge score (>_7.5) of HCVinfection (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.87).CONCLUSIONS: Considering the unsatisfactory level of HCV knowledge among infectedpatients, Egyptian healthcare authorities should organize national awarenesscampaigns encouraging HCV testing based on educational interventions andactivities to improve the level of knowledge. More investment in research is alsoneeded to limit the further growth of the HCV disease burden in Egypt.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"A qualitative assessment of the acceptability of hepatitis C remote self-testing and self-sampling amongst people who use drugs in London, UK.",/pubmed/29914381,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C (HCV) diagnosis and care is a major challenge for people who use illicit drugs, and is characterised by low rates of testing and treatmentengagement globally. New approaches to fostering engagement are needed. Weexplored the acceptability of remote forms of HCV testing including self-testing and self-sampling among people who use drugs in London, UK.METHODS: A qualitative rapid assessment was undertaken with people who use drugs and stakeholders in London, UK. Focus groups were held with men who have sex withmen engaged in drug use, people who currently inject drugs and people whoformerly injected drugs (22 participants across the 3 focus groups). Stakeholdersparticipated in semi-structured interviews (nÊ=_5). We used a thematic analysisto report significant themes in participants' responses.RESULTS: We report an overarching theme of 'tension' in how participantsresponded to the acceptability of remote testing. This tension is evident across four separate sub-themes we explore. First, choice and control, with some valuingthe autonomy and privacy remote testing could support. Second, the ease of use ofself testing linked to its immediate result and saliva sample was preferred over the delayed result from a self administered blood sample tested in a laboratory. Third, many respondents described the need to embed remote testing within asupportive care pathway. Fourth, were concerns over managing a positive result,and its different meanings, in isolation.CONCLUSIONS: The concept of remote HCV testing is acceptable to some people whouse drugs in London, although tensions with lived experience of drug use andhealth system access limit its relevance. Future development of remote testingmust respond to concerns raised in order for acceptable implementation to takeplace.",N,,,,,,,,,,
IL-28B rs12979860 polymorphism affect the course of chronic hepatitis and the development of HCC in Egyptian patients with hepatitis C type 4.,/pubmed/29914308,"BACKGROUND: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B)gene may alter the trajectory of hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection.Several studies have sought to determine a link between the IL28B rs12979860 SNP and the development of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but withvariable results, consensus is awaited. We hypothesised that IL28B rs12979860 SNPis linked to HCC in patients with HCV type 4.METHODS: IL28B genotyping of 300 patients with HCV related fibrosis (n=100),cirrhosis (n=100) and HCC (n=100) was carried out and the results were analyzedto determine the association between the IL28B genotype and clinical outcome.RESULTS: In IL28B TT genotype carriers, proportions of moderate/severe fibrosis, advanced cirrhosis (Child B-C) and HCC (50%, 84% and 60.2%, respectively) werehigher (P<0.05) than in CC/CT (4.3%, 46% and 23%, respectively). IL-28B SNP waslinked significantly (P<0.05) with cirrhosis progression and HCC advanced stages.Moreover, HCC advanced Child, Okuda and CLIP stages were associated with T allelecarriage (73.9%, 82.6% and 78.3% vs. 44.2%, 50.6% and 46.8% in CC/CT). Percent oflarge tumor size (>3cm) increase (P=0.028) in TT genotype carriers (81.8%vs.52.6% in CC/CT).CONCLUSION: IL-28B rs12979860 TT genotype is more prevalent in patients withadvanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC stages. Thus, it seems to be associated withpoor outcomes in chronic HCV patients and to augment the risk of developing HCC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Nontraditional Cardiovascular Biomarkers and Risk Factors: Rationale and Future Perspectives.,/pubmed/29914099,"The primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease depends on the capacity to identify subjects at higher risk long before the occurrence of CV clinicalmanifestations. Traditional risk factors do not cover fully prediction ofindividual risk. Moreover, there is an area of gray for patients at intermediate CV risk, which offers wide margins of improvement. These observations highlightthe need for new additive tools for a more accurate risk stratification. Anincreasing number of candidate biomarkers have been identified to predict CV riskand events, although they generally give only a moderate increase when added tocurrently available predictive scores. The approach utilizing a relative smallnumber of biomarkers in multiple combinations, but only weakly related to eachother or unrelated, thus belonging to independent-pathways, and so able to catch the multidimensional characteristic of atherosclerosis, appears promising. Wediscuss vitamin D and bone turnover biomarkers, hepatitis C virus, andpsycho-emotional factors that may reflect alternative pathways over thosegenerally considered for atherosclerosis (e.g., aspects directly related toinflammation and thrombosis). These new biomarkers could facilitate a moreaccurate assessment of CV risk stratification if incorporated in the current riskassessment algorithms.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Emricasan Improves Liver Function in Patients With Cirrhosis and High Model for End-stage Liver Disease Scores Compared With Placebo.,/pubmed/29913280,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Caspase-mediated apoptosis and inflammation contribute toprogression of liver disease. Emricasan is a pan-caspase inhibitor that reducedserum markers of apoptosis and liver inflammation in patients with hepatitis Cand non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).METHODS: We performed a multicenter study of 86 patients with cirrhosis(Child-Pugh class A or B; mean score, 6.9; 38% with alcohol-associated cirrhosis,29% with HCV-associated cirrhosis, and 23% with NASH) and model for end-stageliver disease (MELD) scores of 11-18 (mean, 12.8). Patients were randomlyassigned to groups given placebo (n=42) or emricasan (25 mg, n=44), twice dailyfor 3 months; subjects then received open-label emricasan (25 mg) twice-daily for3 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in serum levels ofcleaved keratin 18 (CK-18) at month 3.RESULTS: Seventy-four patients completed the 3-month study period (40 givenemricasan and 34 given placebo); 69 patients received open-label emricasan for 3 months afterward. At the 3-month timepoint, emricasan significantly reduced mean MELD (P=.003) and Child-Pugh (P=.003) scores in subjects with high MELD scores(15 or more), compared with placebo, with significant reductions in INR (95% CI, -0.2882 to -0.0866) and total bilirubin (95% CI, -1.5069 to -0.0823) vs placebo. There were no significant differences between emricasan and placebo groups inmean MELD (P=.466) or Child-Pugh (P=.124) scores overall at 3 months compared to placebo. Of patients with high MELD scores, 6/9 given emricasan (67%) had areduction of 2 points or more at month 3, compared with 2/10 given placebo (20%).Serum levels of full-length CK-18 (P=.02) and caspase 3/7 (P<.001), but notcleaved CK-18 (P=.092), decreased significantly at 3 months in the emricasan vsplacebo group. Emricasan was well tolerated, and adverse events were balancedbetween groups. Emricasan's effects were generally maintained or increased after 6 months of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of patients with cirrhosis, we found 3 months treatment with emricasan to improve liver function, compared with placebo,reducing MELD and Child-Pugh scores, INR, and total bilirubin in patients withMELD scores ³15.

Increasing success and evolving barriers in the hepatitis C cascade of care during the direct acting antiviral era.,/pubmed/29912944,"Barriers remain in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) cascade of care (CoC), limitingthe overall impact of direct acting antivirals. This study examines movementbetween the stages of the HCV CoC and identifies reasons why patients andspecific patient populations fail to advance through care in a real worldpopulation. We performed a single-center, ambispective cohort study of patientsreceiving care in an outpatient infectious diseases clinic between October 2015and September 2016. Patients were followed from treatment referral throughsustained virologic response. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performedto identify factors related to completion of each step of the CoC. Of 187patients meeting inclusion criteria, 120 (64%) completed an evaluation for HCVtreatment, 119 (64%) were prescribed treatment, 114 (61%) were approved fortreatment, 113 (60%) initiated treatment, 107 (57%) completed treatment, and 100 (53%) achieved a sustained virologic response. In univariate and multivariateanalyses, patients with Medicaid insurance were less likely to complete anevaluation and were less likely to be approved for treatment. Treatmentcompletion and SVR rates are much improved from historical CoC reports. However, linkage to care following referral continues to be a formidable challenge for theHCV CoC in the DAA era. Ongoing efforts should focus on linkage to care tocapitalize on DAA treatment advances and improving access for patients withMedicaid insurance.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Hepatitis C virus notification rates in Australia are highest in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.,/pubmed/29912897,"BACKGROUND: Poor access to health services is a significant barrier to achieving the World Health Organization's hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets. Wedemonstrate how geospatial analysis can be performed with commonly available datato identify areas with the greatest unmet demand for HCV services.METHODS: We performed an Australia-wide cross-sectional analysis of 2015 HCVnotification rates using local government areas (LGAs) as our unit of analysis. Azero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to determine associationsbetween notification rates and socioeconomic/demographic factors, health service and geographic remoteness area (RA) classification variables. Additionally,component scores were extracted from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the healthcare service variables to provide rankings of relative service coverage andunmet demand across Australia.RESULTS: Among LGAs with non-zero notifications, higher rates were associatedwith areas that had increased socioeconomic disadvantage, more needle and syringeservices (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.022; 95%CI 1.001, 1.044) and more alcohol and other drug services (IRR 1.019; 1.005, 1.034). The distribution of PCAcomponent scores indicated that per-capita healthcare service coverage was lower in areas outside of major Australian cities. Areas outside of major cities alsocontained 94% of LGAs in the lowest two socioeconomic quintiles, as well as 35%of HCV notifications despite only representing 29% of the population.CONCLUSIONS: As countries aim for HCV elimination, routinely collected data canbe used to identify geographical areas for priority service delivery. InAustralia, the unmet demand for HCV treatment services is greatest insocioeconomically disadvantaged and non-metropolitan areas.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Inadequate Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening in Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Cirrhosis.,/pubmed/29912761,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common cause of liverdisease which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommendabdominal ultrasound, with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein, every 6 months forHCC surveillance in cirrhotic patients.GOALS: Describe HCC surveillance rates in NASH cirrhosis compared with hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis and the impact of surveillance on tumor size, treatment, andmortality.STUDY: Adults with NASH and HCV cirrhosis diagnosed with HCC from 2009 to 2016were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were categorized into 3 mutuallyexclusive disease screening groups based on abdominal imaging with or withoutserum alpha-fetoprotein testing before HCC diagnosis.RESULTS: In total, 99 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 162 patients with HCVcirrhosis were evaluated. In total, 51.5% of NASH cirrhosis patients and 25.9% ofHCV cirrhosis patients had no screening before HCC diagnosis. Patients with HCVcirrhosis were significantly more likely to undergo surveillance compared withpatients with NASH cirrhosis (P=0.002). NASH cirrhosis patients who underwentcomplete screening had smaller tumors compared with those with incompletescreening and no screening (P=0.006). There were no differences in number oftumors at diagnosis or mortality between screening groups in patients with NASHcirrhosis (P=0.281 and 0.468, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: There is suboptimal HCC surveillance in NASH and HCV cirrhoticpatients, with a greater proportion of patients with NASH cirrhosis notundergoing surveillance.

The primary endpoint wassustained virologic response (SVR) rates at posttreatment weeks 12 and 24.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate safety by tolerability and adverse events(AEs).RESULTS: Among 231 patients screened, 186 were enrolled. At baseline, 31%(57/186) patients were cirrhotic, 34% (63/186) were treatment experienced. Mostof the subjects (42%, 79/186) received ledispavir/SOF therapy. The overall SVR12 was 95%, ranging from 86% in genotype (GT) 1b on SOF+ribavirin to 100% in GT 1bpatients on ledipasvir/SOF at subgroup analyses. SVR12 was significantly lower incirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients [88% (50/57) vs. 98% (126/129), P<0.01]. Stratified by GT, SVR12 were: 96% (43/45) in GT 1a; 93% (67/72) in GT 1b; 100%(23/23) in GT 2; 90% (19/21) in GT 3; 100% (1/1) in GT 4; 83% (5/6) in GT 5; and 100% (16/16) in GT 6.

Hyperlipidemia and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Predispose to Hepatocellular Carcinoma Development Without Cirrhosis.,/pubmed/29912756,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% of primary hepaticmalignancies. With the exception of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), other etiologiesof chronic liver disease require progression to cirrhosis before HCC development.Case reports have described HCC in noncirrhotic patients with hepatitis C (HCV)and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.GOAL: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of patients withoutcirrhosis and CHB who developed HCC among a large cohort of HCC patients and toidentify independent variables that are associated with no cirrhosis amongpatients with HCC.STUDY: From 2005 to 2015, hepatobiliary cancer patients seen in our liver cancer and liver transplant clinics were evaluated. Patients were included if above18years old and had histologically confirmed HCC from liver biopsy, resectionspecimen, or explanted livers. Patients with CHB, non-HCC tumors, or missingpaired tumor and nontumor liver histology were excluded. Demographic information,pertinent laboratory values, and comorbid conditions were recorded. Potentialpredictors were evaluated using both backward stepwise logistic regression model and classification tree model.RESULTS: Of the 1927 patients screened, 545 HCC patients (411 transplanted, 43resected, 74 transarterial chemoembolization/radiofrequency ablation, 17untreated) included, 29 (5.3%) patients had no cirrhosis histologically. Elevenpatients had HCV, 3 had alcoholic liver disease, 3 had nonalcoholic fatty liver, and 12 had cryptogenic liver disease. Logistic regression models show thatpatients with hyperlipidemia and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase are morelikely to develop HCC without cirrhosis (odds ratio, 1.73 and 0.40; P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort, histology-confirmed case-controlled study showsthat patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia withelevated serum alanine aminotransferase (most likely nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis) are significantly associated with the development of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis.",N,,,,,,,,,,
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HTAsiaLINK NETWORK AND ITS KEY DETERMINANTS OF SUCCESS.,/pubmed/29911515,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the historical development ofthe HTAsiaLink network, draw lessons for other similar initiatives globally, and to analyze key determinants of its success and challenges for its futuredevelopment.METHODS: This study is based on the collective and direct experiences of thefounding members of the HTAsiaLink Network. Data were collected frompresentations they made at various international forums and additionalinformation was reviewed. Data analysis was done using the framework developed bySan Martin-Rodriguez et al.Results and Conclusions:HTAsiaLink is a network ofhealth technology assessment (HTA) agencies in Asia established in 2011 with the aim of strengthening individual and institutional HTA capacity, reducingduplication and optimizing resources, transfer and sharing of HTA-related lessonsamong members, and beyond. During its 6 years, the network has expanded,initiating several capacity building activities and joint-research projects,raising awareness of the importance of HTA within the region and beyond, andgaining global recognition while establishing relationships with other globalnetworks. The study identifies the determinants of success of the collaboration. The systemic factors include the favorable outlook toward HTA as an approach for healthcare priority setting in countries with UHC mandates. On organizationalfactors, the number of newly established HTA agencies in the region with similar needs for capacity building and peer-to-peer support was catalytic for thenetwork development. The interactional aspects include ownership, trust, and teamspirit among network members. The network, however, faces challenges notably,financial sustainability and management of the expanded network.",N,,,,,,,,,,

State Medicaid Reimbursement for Medications for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection from 2012 through 2015.,/pubmed/29909874,"BACKGROUND: New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) can cure chronic hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) infection. High DAA prices combined with a large number of patientsneeding treatment may pose substantial economic burden on health systems.OBJECTIVES: To examine Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCV infectionbefore and after the availability of new DAAs overall and by state and to alsoassess the impact of Medicaid expansion on reimbursement for DAAs.METHODS: We calculated Medicaid reimbursements for medications for HCV infection between 2012 and 2015 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Outcomesincluded inflation-adjusted Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCVinfection, market share of individual DAAs, percentages of Medicaid outpatientpharmacy reimbursement for DAAs, and Medicaid reimbursement per Medicaid enrolleewith HCV infection.RESULTS: Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCV infection increased from $723 million in 2012 to $2.35 billion in 2015. We found variations in Medicaidreimbursement for DAAs between states in 2014 (up to 7.4 times HCV infectionprevalence) that widened in 2015 (0.1-11.4 times HCV infection prevalence).Expansion states had significantly higher increases in reimbursement for DAAs perenrollee with HCV infection compared with non- or late-expansion states($2178.60; 95% confidence interval $1558.90-$2798.40), controlling forpre-expansion reimbursement.CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid reimbursement for DAAs differs across states aftercontrolling for HCV infection prevalence. A third of states contributed more than5% to 15% of pharmacy reimbursements to DAAs. Medications for HCV infection areonly one class of highly priced specialty drugs. Innovative policy strategies areneeded for health systems to manage coverage for an increasing number ofexpensive specialty medications indicated for an increasing number of patients.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Prevalence and outcome of post-transfusion hepatitis C acquired at different ages and detected in look-back screening.,/pubmed/29909701,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Sweden isestimated to 0.5%. Before 1992, blood transfusion posed a risk of HCVtransmission. The primary aim of this study was to estimate anti-HCV prevalencein Stockholm County among individuals receiving blood transfusions 1965-1991. Thesecondary aim was to study the effect of age at transfusion on the development ofliver disease and treatment outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of individuals found tobe anti-HCV tested positive in Stockholm County during a national screeningcampaign in Sweden 2008-2010. All anti-HCV-positive individuals were also HCV RNAtested. Data on age at transfusion, age at diagnosis, HCV genotype, viral load,fibrosis score, liver histology and antiviral treatment were recorded.RESULTS: Out of 7473, 134 (1.8%) tested individuals were anti-HCV positive and102 were HCV RNA positive resulting in a prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) of 1.4%. The rate of advanced liver damage was 18% (10/56). Patients younger than19 years of age at transfusion were significantly more often started on antiviraltreatment compared to adult patients, 65% vs 29% p_<_.001. No significantcorrelation was found between treatment outcome and gender or age at transfusion.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found an anti-HCV prevalence of 1.8% which isconsiderably higher than the estimated prevalence in the Swedish generalpopulation (0.5%), and patients infected during childhood were more likely toreceive antiviral treatment. Additional data on the HCV epidemic in Sweden areneeded regarding prevalence and age distribution.",N,,,,,,,,,,
A successful treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with Osler-Rendu-Weber disease using radiofrequency ablation under laparoscopy.,/pubmed/29909559,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be difficult to diagnose and treat in patientswith Osler-Rendu-Weber disease due to vascular malformation and regenerativenodular hyperplasia. In addition, percutaneous liver puncture should be avoidedfor the diagnosis and treatment as the procedure carries a high risk of bleeding.We herein report the successful treatment of HCC in a patient withOsler-Rendu-Weber disease using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under laparoscopy. A 71-year-old man with Osler-Rendu-Weber disease was admitted to our hospital forthe treatment of HCC. He also had chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Thearterioportal shunts in the liver were detected by computed tomography (CT) andangiography. A tumor 20Êmm in size was detected as a defected-lesion in thehepatic segment IV during the portal phase by CT. RFA under laparoscopy wasperformed for the curative treatment for HCC, with sufficient ablation obtained. Although the blood gushed out from the needle tract at the end of the procedure, complete hemostasis was achieved promptly using coagulation forceps. Thepost-operative course was favorable. Thus, laparoscopic RFA is a useful treatmentmodality for HCC in patients with Osler-Rendu-Weber disease, as a hemostasisdevice can be used with direct visualization.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Pharmacokinetics of Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, Ritonavir, and Dasabuvir in Healthy Chinese Subjects and HCV GT1b-Infected Chinese, South Korean and Taiwanese Patients.",/pubmed/29909549,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The 3 direct-acting antiviral (3D) regimen ofombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir has recently been approved inseveral Asian geographic regions for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)genotype (GT) 1 infection. The pharmacokinetics of the components of the 3Dregimen with or without ribavirin were evaluated in healthy Chinese subjects and HCV GT1b-infected Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese patients, with or without cirrhosis, to determine how the drug exposures in Asian populations compare with historical data in Western populations.METHODS: Participants received ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25/150/100Êmgonce daily plus dasabuvir 250Êmg twice daily for 14Êdays (healthy subjects,n_=_36) or 12Êweeks (HCV patients, n_=_754). Patients with compensated cirrhosis also received ribavirin 1000 or 1200Êmg divided twice daily, per the local label.Intensive or sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was performed for assessments ofplasma drug concentrations.RESULTS: The exposures [maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under theplasma concentration-time curve (AUC)] of the components of the 3D regimen werecomparable (<_20% difference) in healthy Chinese subjects residing in China orthe United States. In addition, the trough plasma concentrations (C trough ) inHCV GT1b-infected Asian patients were either similar to (ombitasvir) or within75% of (paritaprevir and dasabuvir) those in Western patients without cirrhosis, or similar to (ombitasvir and paritaprevir) or within 100% of (dasabuvir) thosein Western patients with cirrhosis, with widely overlapping ranges of individual values. Generally comparable drug exposures were observed among Chinese, SouthKorean, and Taiwanese ethnicities for noncirrhotic and cirrhotic patients.CONCLUSION: Collectively, the results of these pharmacokinetic analyses supportthe use of the same dose of the 3D regimen for Asian and Western patients.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT02534870, NCT02517515, NCT02517528.",Single arm,Y,,,,,,,,,
"IL-15 and IFN-ë_ signal through the ERK pathway to inhibit HCV replication, independent of type I IFN signaling.",/pubmed/29908921,"Despite effective new treatments for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection,development of drug resistance, safety concerns and cost are remainingchallenges. More importantly, there is no vaccine available against hepatitis Cinfection. Recent data suggest that there is a strong correlation betweenspontaneous HCV clearance and human NK cell function, particularly IFN-_production. Further, IL-15 has innate antiviral activity and is also one of themain factors that activates NK cells to produce IFN-_. To examine whether IL-15and IFN-_ have direct antiviral activity against HCV, Huh7.5 cells were treatedwith either IFN-_ or IL-15 prior to HCV infection. Our data demonstrate thatIFN-_ and IL-15 block HCV replication in vitro. Additionally, we show that IL-15 and IFN-_ do not induce anti-HCV effects through the type I interferon signaling pathway or nitric oxide (NO) production. Instead, IL-15 and IFN-_ provideprotection against HCV via the ERK pathway. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with aMEK/ERK inhibitor abrogated the anti-HCV effects of IL-15 and IFN-_ andoverexpression of ERK1 prevented HCV replication compared to controltransfection. Our in vitro data support the hypothesis that early production ofIL-15 and activation of NK cells in the liver lead to control of HCV replication.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis is the Fastest Growing Cause of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Liver Transplant Candidates.,/pubmed/29908364,"BACKGROUND: While hepatitis B and C have been the main drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has recently become animportant cause of HCC. The aim of this study was to assess the causes of HCCamong liver transplant (LT) candidates in the U.S.METHODS: The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (2002-2016) was used toestimate the trends in prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with the most commontypes of chronic liver disease: alcoholic liver disease (ALD), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C, and NASH.RESULTS: 158,347 adult LT candidates were included. Of these, 26,121 (16.5%) had HCC; this proportion increased from 6.4% (2002) to 23.0% (2016) (trend p<0.0001).Over the study period, CHC remained the most common etiology for HCC (65%). Theproportions of HCC accounted for by CHC and ALD remained stable (both trendp>0.10), the proportion of CHB decreased 3.1-fold (p<0.0001), while theproportion of NASH in HCC increased 7.7-fold (from 2.1% to 16.2%, p<0.0001).Furthermore, since 2002, the prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with NASHincreased 11.8-fold, while this rate increased 6.0-fold in CHB, 3.4-fold in ALDand 2.3-fold in CHC (all p<0.0001); the increasing trend in NASH was steeper thanthat for any other etiology (p<0.0001 in a trend regression model). Theproportion of LT candidates with HCC who were ultimately transplanted or diedwhile waiting did not differ between etiologies (p>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is the most rapidly growing cause ofHCC among U.S. patients listed for liver transplantation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced nanoparticle uptake into virus infected cells: Could nanoparticles be useful in antiviral therapy?,/pubmed/29908332,"Virus infections cause diseases of different severity ranged from mild infection e.g. common cold into life threatening diseases e.g. Human Immunodeficiency virus(HIV), Hepatitis B. Virus infections represent 44% of newly emerging infections. Although there are many efficient antiviral agents, they still have drawbacks dueto accumulation at off target organs and developing of virus resistance due tovirus mutation. Therefore, developing a delivery system that can selectivelytarget drug into affected organs and avoid off target accumulation would be ahighly advantageous strategy to improve antiviral therapy. Nanoparticles (NP) canbe effectively targeted to the liver, and therefore it could be used forimproving therapy of hepatic virus infections including hepatitis B virus andhepatitis C virus (HCV). Many studies were performed to encapsulate antiviralagents into nano-delivery system to improve their pharmacokinetics parameters to have a better therapeutic efficacy with lower side effects. However, the effectof virus infection on the uptake of NP has not yet been studied in detail. Thelatter is a crucial area as modulation of endocytic uptake of nanoparticles couldimpact on reduce potential therapeutic usefulness of antiviral agents loaded intonano-delivery system. In this study, a fluorescently-labelled polymericnanoparticle was prepared and used to track NP uptake into Huh7.5, human hepatomacells transfected with replicating HCV genomes, compared with non-transfectedcells as a model representing hepatocyte uptake. Confocal microscopy and flowcytometry of virus transfected Huh7.5 cells unexpectedly demonstrated two-foldincrease in uptake of NP compared to non-transfected cells. Therefore, virustransfection enhanced NP uptake into Huh7.5 cells and NP could be considered as apromising delivery system for targeted treatment of hepatitis viruses.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Utilization and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir for treating hepatitis C virus infection after liver transplantation.,/pubmed/29908044,"AIM: Recently, elbasvir/grazoprevir combination therapy (EBR/GZR therapy) hasbeen reported to have excellent antiviral effects for chronic genotype 1hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, it has not been recommended forpatients with post-liver transplant (LT) HCV re-infections because of a lack ofevidence for effectiveness and drug-drug interactions.METHODS: We report the usage of EBR/GZR in five post-LT HCV re-infected patients with the kinetics of renal function and tacrolimus (Tac) trough levels during andafter therapy. Further, to evaluate the antiviral effects, we examined the HCVkinetics during and after therapy and compared this with other IFN-free therapyin post-LT patients (n=19).RESULTS: All patients treated with EBR/GZR therapy obtained rapid virologicalresponse and sustained at 12 weeks post-treatment. There was no evidence ofworsening estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). Three patients wereadministrated tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy and its trough levels were controllable with dosage adjustments. One patient developed grade 1 diarrhea 3days after therapy induction. To evaluate the antiviral effects of EBR/GZRtherapy for these patients, we compared them to the effects ofdaclatasvir/asunaprevir combination therapy (n=8) and sofosbuvir/ledipasvircombination therapy (n=11). EBR/GZR therapy was not inferior to other therapiesin its early phase and late-phase antiviral effects.CONCLUSIONS: Although further studies with a larger number of patients arerequired, we suggest that EBR/GZR therapy is an alternative therapy for patients with post-LT genotype 1 HCV re-infections.",N,,,,,,,,,,

ADAR1 affects HCV infection by modulating innate immune response.,/pubmed/29906476,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a globally prevalent infectious pathogen. As many as 80% of people infected with HCV do not control the virus and develop a chronicinfection. Response to interferon (IFN) therapy is widely variable in chronic HCVinfected patients, suggesting that HCV has evolved mechanisms to suppress andevade innate immunity responsible for its control and elimination. Adenosinedeaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a relevant factor in the regulation of theinnate immune response. The loss of ADAR1 RNA-editing activity and the resulting loss of inosine bases in RNA are critical in producing aberrant RLR-mediatedinnate immune response, mediated by RNA sensors MDA5 and RIG-I. Here, we describeADAR1 role as a regulator of innate and antiviral immune function in HCVinfection, both in vitro and in patients. Polymorphisms within ADAR1 gene werefound significantly associated to poor clinical outcome to HCV therapy andadvanced liver fibrosis in a cohort of HCV and HIV-1 coinfected patients.Moreover, ADAR1 knockdown in primary macrophages and Huh7 hepatoma cells enhancedIFN and IFN stimulated gene expression and increased HCV replication in vitro.Overall, our results demonstrate that ADAR1 regulates innate immune signaling andis an important contributor to the outcome of the HCV virus-host interaction.ADAR1 is a potential target to boost antiviral immune response in HCV infection.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection with crushed elbasvir/grazoprevir administered via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.,/pubmed/29906312,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Elbasvir/grazoprevir is an all-oral regimen approvedfor patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 and 4, and in renalinsufficiency.

Forecasting Hepatitis C liver disease burden on real life data. Does the hidden iceberg matter to reach the elimination goals?,/pubmed/29900654,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Advances in direct acting anti-viral treatment of HCV havereinvigorated public health initiatives aimed at identifying affectedindividuals. We evaluated the possible impact of only diagnosed andlinked-to-care individuals on overall HCV burden estimates and identified apossible strategy to achieve the WHO targets by 2030.METHODS: Using a modelling approach grounded in Italian real-life data ofdiagnosed and treated patients, different linkage-to-care scenarios were built toevaluate potential strategies in achieving the HCV elimination goals.RESULTS: Under the 40% linked-to-care scenario, viremic burden would decline(60%); however eligible patients to treat will be depleted by 2025. Increasedcase finding through a targeted screening strategy in 1948-1978 birth cohortscould supplement the pool of diagnosed patients by finding 75% of F0-F3 cases.Under the 60% linked-to-care scenario, viremic infections would decline by 70% by2030 but the patients eligible for treatment will run out by 2028. If treatmentis to be maintained, a screening strategy focusing on 1958-1978 birth cohortscould capture 55% of F0-F3 individuals. Under the 80% linked-to-care scenario,screening limited in 1968-1978 birth cohorts could sustain treatment at levelsrequired to achieve the HCV elimination goals.CONCLUSION: In Italy, which is an HCV endemic country, the eligible pool ofpatients to treat will run out between 2025 and 2028. To maintain the treatmentrate and achieve the HCV elimination goals, increased case finding in targeted,high prevalence groups is required. This article is protected by copyright.

"Change in hepatic profile in hepatitis C virus genotype 4 patients with compensated cirrhosis receiving ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin: a subanalysis of the AGATE-II study.",/pubmed/29900553,"BACKGROUND: In AGATE-II, treatment with ombitasvir co-formulated withparitaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin (RBV) in Egyptians infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV GT4) resulted in high rates of sustained virologicresponse at Post-Treatment Week 12. This subanalysis examined the effects oftreatment in AGATE-II on liver biomarkers in patients with compensated cirrhosis.METHODS: AGATE-II was a phase 3, open-label, partly randomized trial ofonce-daily ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with weight-based RBV intreatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients. Patients without cirrhosisreceived treatment for 12 weeks and patients with compensated cirrhosis wererandomized 1:1 to the same regimen for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks.RESULTS: Sixty patients with compensated cirrhosis were randomized to treatmentfor 12 weeks (n=31) or 24 weeks (n=29). In the 12-week arm, significantimprovements were observed in biomarkers of liver injury (alanineaminotransferase: -53.7 U/L, p<0.001; aspartate aminotransferase: -35.9 U/L,p<0.001) and liver fibrosis (aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index: -0.987, p<0.001; fibrosis-4 index: -1.165, p<0.001). Similar results werereported in the 24-week arm.CONCLUSION: Treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus RBV in HCVGT4-infected Egyptians with compensated cirrhosis resulted in improvements incertain biomarkers of liver synthetic function, injury, and fibrosis, independentof treatment duration.

Clinical and genetic determinants of nevirapine plasma trough concentration.,/pubmed/29899984,"Background: Only few data are available on the influence of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/A5 polymorphisms on nevirapine plasma concentrations in the Caucasian population.Our aim was to assess the impact of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/A5 polymorphisms onnevirapine plasma concentrations consecutively collected.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of all HIV-positive patientswho were followed at the Infectious Diseases Unit, DIBIC Luigi Sacco, University of Milan between January 2000 and December 2015. All patients with at least onenevirapine plasma trough concentration (NVP Cmin) determination were tested forCYP2B6 c.516 G>T, CYP3A4*22C>T and CYP3A5*3 A>G polymorphisms. Univariate andmultivariate regression analyses were carried out considering NVP Cmin as thedependent variable and genetic polymorphisms and clinical characteristics asindependent variables.Results: A total of 143 patients were evaluated.

The TRPV4 channel links calcium influx to DDX3X activity and viral infectivity.,/pubmed/29899501,"Ion channels are well placed to transduce environmental cues into signals used bycells to generate a wide range of responses, but little is known about their rolein the regulation of RNA metabolism. Here we show that the TRPV4 cation channelbinds the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X and regulates its function. TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx releases DDX3X from the channel and drives DDX3X nucleartranslocation, a process that involves calmodulin (CaM) and the CaM-dependentkinase II. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 diminishesDDX3X-dependent functions, including nuclear viral export and translation.Furthermore, TRPV4 mediates Ca2+ influx and nuclear accumulation of DDX3X incells exposed to the Zika virus or the purified viral envelope protein.Consequently, targeting of TRPV4 reduces infectivity of dengue, hepatitis C andZika viruses. Together, our results highlight the role of TRPV4 in the regulationof DDX3X-dependent control of RNA metabolism and viral infectivity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Novel Uridine Glycoconjugates, Derivatives of 4-Aminophenyl 1-Thioglycosides, as Potential Antiviral Compounds.",/pubmed/29899276,"A novel series of uridine glycoconjugates, derivatives of 4-aminophenyl1-thioglycosides, was designed and synthesized. All compounds were evaluated invitro for their antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), two important human and animal viral pathogens forwhich new or improved therapeutic options are needed. The antiviral activity ofall synthesized compounds was confirmed using pseudo-plaque reduction assays inwhich a significant arrest of CSFV and HCV growth was observed in the presence ofthese compounds. Two of the synthesized compounds, 9 and 12, displayed asignificant inhibitory effect on HCV and CSFV propagation with IC50 values of 4.9and 13.5 &micro;M for HCV and 4.2 and 4 &micro;M for CSFV, respectively, with lowcytotoxicity. Using various infection and replication models, we have shown that both compounds were able to significantly reduce viral genome replication by upto 90% with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. A structure activityanalysis of the synthesized compounds showed that the high antiviral activity wasattributed to the hydrophobicity of glycoconjugates and the introduction ofelements capable to coordinate metal ions into the spacer connecting the sugarand uridine moiety, which can be useful in the development of new antiviralcompounds in the future.",N,,,,,,,,,,
LncITPRIP-1 Positively Regulates Innate Immune Response through Promoting Oligomerization and Activation of MDA5.,/pubmed/29899107,"Emerging evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes, especially innate and adaptive immunity. However, therelationship between lncRNAs and interferon (IFN) pathway remains largelyunknown. Here, we report that lncRNA ITPRIP-1 (lncITPRIP-1) is involved in viral infection and plays a crucial role in virus-triggered IFN signaling pathwaythrough targeting MDA5. LncITPRIP-1 can be induced by viral infection, which isnot entirely dependent on IFN signal. Besides, there is no coding potential foundin lncITPRIP-1 transcript. LncITPRIP-1 binds to the C-terminal of MDA5 and itpossesses the ability to boost oligomerization of both full length and 2CARDdomains of MDA5 in a K63-linked-polyubiquitination-independent manner. Amazingly,we also find that MDA5 could suppress HCV replication independent of IFNsignaling through its C-terminal deficient domain bound to viral RNA, in whichlncITPRIP-1 plays as an assistant. In addition, the expression of lncITPRIP-1 is highly consistent with MDA5 expression, indicating that lncITPRIP-1 may function as a cofactor of MDA5. All the data suggest that lncITPRIP-1 enhances innateimmune response to viral infection through promoting oligomerization andactivation of MDA5. Our study discovers the first lncRNA ITPRIP-1 involved inMDA5 activation.SIGNIFICANCE Hepatitis C virus infection causes a global healthissue and there is still no available vaccine, which makes it urgent to revealthe underlying mechanisms of HCV and host factors. Although RIG-I has beenrecognized as the leading cytoplasmic sensor against HCV for a long time, recent findings of MDA5 regulating IFN response to HCV have emerged. Our work validates the significant role of MDA5 in IFN signaling and HCV infection, and proposes thefirst lncRNA inhibiting HCV replication by promoting the activation of MDA5 andmediating the association between MDA5 and HCV RNA, which may shed light on MDA5 function study and the treatment for hepatitis C patients. Our suggested model ofhow lncITPRIP-1 can orchestrate signal transduction for IFN productionillustrates the essential role of lncRNAs in virus elimination.",N,,,,,,,,,,

"Prevalence of Single and Multiple Natural NS3, NS5A and NS5B Resistance-Associated Substitutions in Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes 1-4 in Italy.",/pubmed/29895871,"Natural resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) are reported with highlyvariable prevalence across different HCV genotypes (GTs). Frequency of naturalRASs in a large Italian real-life cohort of patients infected with the 4 mainHCV-GTs was investigated. NS3, NS5A and NS5B sequences were analysed in 1445HCV-infected DAA-nave patients. Sanger-sequencing was performed by home-madeprotocols on 464 GT1a, 585 GT1b, 92 GT2c, 199 GT3a, 16 GT4a and 99 GT4d samples. Overall, 20.7% (301/1455) of patients showed natural RASs, and the prevalence of multiclass-resistance was 7.3% (29/372 patients analysed). NS3-RASs wereparticularly common in GT1a and GT1b (45.2-10.8%, respectively), mainly due to80K presence in GT1a (17%). Almost all GTs showed high prevalence of NS5A-RASs(range: 10.2-45.4%), and especially of 93H (5.1%). NS5A-RASs with fold-change>100x were detected in 6.8% GT1a (30H/R-31M-93C/H), 10.3% GT1b (31V-93H), 28.4%GT2c (28C-31M-93H), 8.5% GT3a (30K-93H), 45.5% GT4a (28M-30R-93H) and 3.8% GT4d(28V-30S-93H). Sofosbuvir RAS 282T was never detected, while the 159F and 316NRASs were found in GT1b (13.4-19.1%, respectively). Natural RASs are common inItalian patients infected with HCV-GTs 1-4.

"Risk factors for acquiring HCV at a healthcare center in Hidalgo, Mexico.",/pubmed/29895448,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The approach to HCV infection begins with the directedsearch for risk factors linked to its acquisition. Therefore, our primary aim wasto identify the prevalence of risk factors associated with HCV infections ininsured individuals seen at the Hidalgo delegation of the IMSS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study wasconducted through validated surveys that identified major and minor risk factors.In cases of major risk factors, the Advanced Qualityª RAPID-ANTI-HCV TESTAccutrack¨ tests were applied to detect anti-HCV. Patients with positive testswere referred to the Hepatology service for the diagnostic-therapeutic approach. Statistical analysis was performed through measures of central tendency andpercentages.RESULTS: A total of 528 insured individuals were surveyed (95%CI with a 5% marginof error). Two hundred eighty-two rapid tests were performed. Five of them werepositive (0.94%) and belonged to the patients in the dialysis/hemodialysis group.A total of 71.2% persons had positive risk factors. The association of 2 or more factors varied from 2 to 8 factors present at the same time. Of the entire study population, 6.25% presented with 4 risk factors and 4.35% presented with 5 riskfactors at the same time.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly three quarters of the individuals surveyed were exposed toHCV acquisition. The association of 2 or more risk factors in patientsdemonstrated their collective potentiality for acquiring HCV. We identifiedpersons receiving treatment with dialysis/hemodialysis and those with high-risksexual practices as vulnerable groups for HCV infection and suggest that theyreceive promotion and prevention activities, as well as public policy management.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for chronic hepatitis C: a systematic review of model-based analyses.,/pubmed/29895281,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about which subgroup of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients should be treated with direct acting anti-viral agents (DAAs) have economicimportance due to high drug prices. Treat-all DAA strategies for CHC have gained acceptance despite high drug acquisition costs. However, there are also costsassociated with the surveillance of CHC to determine a subgroup of patients with significant impairment. The aim of this systematic review was to describe themodelling methods used and summarise results in cost-effectiveness analyses(CEAs) of both CHC treatment with DAAs and surveillance of liver disease.METHODS: Electronic databases including Embase and Medline were searched frominception to May 2015. Eligible studies included models predicting costs and/oroutcomes for interventions, surveillance, or management of people with CHC.Narrative and quantitative synthesis were conducted. Quality appraisal wasconducted using validated checklists. The review was conducted followingprinciples published by NHS Centre for Research and Dissemination.RESULTS: Forty-one CEAs met the eligibility criteria for the review; 37 evaluatedan intervention and four evaluated surveillance strategies for targeting DAAtreatment to those likely to gain most benefit. Included studies were of variablequality mostly due to reporting omissions. Of the 37 CEAs, eight models thatenabled comparative analysis were fully appraised and synthesized. These modelsprovided non-unique cost-effectiveness estimates in a specific DAA comparison in a specific population defined in terms of genotype, prior treatment status, andpresence or absence of cirrhosis. Marked heterogeneity in cost-effectivenessestimates was observed despite this stratification. Approximately half of theestimates suggested that DAAs were cost-effective considering a threshold ofUS$30,000 and 73% with threshold of US$50,000. Two models evaluating surveillancestrategies suggested that treating all CHC patients regardless of the staging of liver disease could be cost-effective.CONCLUSIONS: CEAs of CHC treatments need to better account for variability intheir estimates. This analysis suggested that there are still circumstances whereDAAs are not cost-effective. Surveillance in place of a treat-all strategy maystill need to be considered as an option for deploying DAAs, particularly whereacquisition cost is at the limit of affordability for a given health system.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Developmental Disorders and Medical Complications Among Infants with Subclinical Intrauterine Opioid Exposures.,/pubmed/29893624,"The objective was to compare diagnosis rates representing developmental outcomes and medical complications between infants with intrauterine opioid exposures who did not receive pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome at thetime of birth and infants for whom no exposure to substances of abuse weredetected. This retrospective, descriptive study included approximately 95% ofHamilton County, Ohio resident births in 2014 and 2015. Universal maternal drugtest results, performed at the time of birth, were documented and linked toelectronic health records representing pediatric primary and subspecialtyfollow-up care as well as urgent care, emergency care, and inpatient servicesprovided by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center through 2017, when all children were at least 24 months old. Diagnosis rates were compared between drug exposure groups using chi-square tests. Among infants born at >34 weeks gestationand without other complex clinical conditions, infants with subclinical opioidexposures (N_=_473) were more likely than infants with no drug exposures(N_=_14,933) to be diagnosed with behavioral or emotional disorders (3.0% vs1.1%, P_=_0.0008), developmental delay (15.6% vs 7.6%, P_<_0.0001), speechdisorder (10.1% vs 6.5%, P_=_0.001), or strabismus (3.4% vs 1.0%, P_<_0.0001),and more likely to be exposed to the hepatitis C virus (6.8% vs 0.1%,P_<_0.0001). Increased diagnosis rates among all opioid exposed infants,regardless of withdrawal severity, may warrant the additional allocation ofresources for screening and follow-up. Awareness of the increased risk forcertain developmental delays and medical conditions is critical to earlyintervention and treatment supporting improved outcomes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Viral Eradication is Required for Sustained Improvement of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients with Hepatitis C.,/pubmed/29893462,"BACKGROUND: Clearance of chronic HCV infection improves quality of life and otherpatient-reported outcomes (PROs). Lack of placebo-controlled data led to concernsabout the extent of contribution of viral eradication to PRO improvement.AIM: To assess PRO changes in HCV patients initially randomized to placebotreatment who received SOF/VEL/VOX in a deferred treatment sub-study.METHODS: HCV-infected direct-acting antivirals-experienced patients who received placebo treatment in POLARIS-1 subsequently received SOF/VEL/VOX(400mg/100mg/100mg) daily for 12 weeks. PROs were prospectively collected usingSF-36v2, CLDQ-HCV, FACIT-F, WPAI:SHP.RESULTS: Of 147 patients treated, most were male (79%), white (82%), 33% hadcirrhosis, 99% had HCV genotype 1 with SVR-12 of 97%. During treatment withplacebo, there were no significant changes in any PROs from patients' ownbaseline (all p>0.05) except for the Worry domain of CLDQ-HCV. However, soonafter initiation of treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX, significant PRO improvements werenoted: +2.4% to +8.1% of a PRO range size, p<0.05 for 6 of the 26 studied PROs,by treatment week 4; +2.0% to +8.3%, p<0.05 for 14/26 PROs by treatment week 12. Achieving SVR was associated with similar or greater PRO improvement: +2.5% to+11.9%, p<0.05 for 24/26 PROs, by SVR-12; +3.2% to +14.9%, p<0.05 for 23/26 PROs,by SVR-24. In multivariate regression analysis, being viremic was associated withPRO impairment: beta from -2.4% to -8.5%, p<0.05 for all but one PRO.CONCLUSION: Treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks led to significant andsustainable improvement in patient-reported outcomes in patients who hadpreviously failed another direct-acting antiviral regimen.

Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Vaccine Development.,/pubmed/29892184,"In the twenty-seven years since the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) themajority of individuals exposed to HCV establish a persistent infection, which isa leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.In developed nations, the cure rates of HCV infection could be over 90% withdirect-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, which has made the great progress inglobal eradication. However, the cost of these treatments is so expensive thatthe patients in developing nations, where the disease burden is the most severe, could not afford it, which highly restricted its access. Additionally, thelargely asymptomatic nature of infection facilitates continued transmission inrisk groups due to limited surveillance. Consequently a protective vaccine andlikely emergence of drug-resistant viral variants call for further studies of HCVbiology. In the current review, the development and the progress of preventiveand therapeutic vaccines against the HCV have been reviewed in the context ofpeptide vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, HCV-like particle, DNA vaccinesand viral vectors expressing HCV genes.",N,,,,,,,,,,

CREB1 functional polymorphisms modulating promoter transcriptional activity are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in Chinese population.,/pubmed/29729382,"The cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) is a ubiquitoustranscription factor that contributes to the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Themechanisms of the CREB1 function remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore genetic variations in CREB1 promoter region and determine whetherthese loci affect transcriptional activity and risk on type 2 diabetes (T2D).Three polymorphisms were identified and designated as MU1, MU2 and MU3,respectively. Genotypic distribution analysis revealed that MU1 genotypespresented similar distribution between T2D and healthy controls (P_>_0.05), whilethe MU2 and MU3 showed significant differences (P_<_0.05). Haplotypic blocks ofthe three loci were constructed, and H1-TGA, H2-TTT and H3-ATT had higherfrequencies in T2D patients than those in controls. Association studies revealed that the three loci significantly affected plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobinand insulin secretion. Disequilibrium analysis identified that the MU2 and MU3variants were strongly linked in T2D (r2_=_0.348, D'_=_1.0). Further analysisindicated that MU2 (TT vs GG, OR_=_2.38, 95%CI_=_1.19-4.77, P_=_0.01) and MU3 (AAvs TT, OR_=_1.16, 95%CI_=_1.19-4.77, P_=_0.04) were significantly associated withT2D in dominant genotypes. Luciferase assay showed that T-A haplotype from thehighly linked MU2 and MU3 exhibited maximal promoter activity, which wasconsistent with the correlation results.

The starting dosage for glyburide was 2.5 mg orally once per dayand could be increased if necessary 4 days later by 2.5 mg and thereafter by 5 mgevery 4 days in 2 morning and evening doses, up to a maximum of 20 mg/d. Thestarting dosage for insulin was 4 IU to 20 IU given subcutaneously 1 to 4 timesper day as necessary and increased according to self-measured blood glucoseconcentrations.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite criterionincluding macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Thenoninferiority margin was set at 7% based on a 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval.Results: Among the 914 patients who were randomized (mean age, 32.8 [SD, 5.2]years), 98% completed the trial. In a per-protocol analysis, 367 and 442 womenand their neonates were analyzed in the glyburide and insulin groups,respectively. The frequency of the primary outcome was 27.6% in the glyburidegroup and 23.4% in the insulin group, a difference of 4.2% (1-sided 97.5% CI, -Á to 10.5%; P=.19).Conclusion and Relevance: This study of women with gestational diabetes failed toshow that use of glyburide compared with subcutaneous insulin does not result in a greater frequency of perinatal complications. These findings do not justify theuse of glyburide as a first-line treatment.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01731431.",RCT,,,,Oral gylburide,Subcutaneous insulin,,,Gestational diabetes,"Composite criterion including macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia",
Spironolactone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control and arterial stiffness improvement: A prospective study.,/pubmed/29668634,"The present study is to investigate whether spironolactone is better thanhydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for blood pressure (BP) control and arterial stiffnessimprovement. Five-hundred-sixty-six uncontrolled hypertensive patients with 2different classes of antihypertensive medications treatment were enrolled.Spironolactone or HCTZ was randomly prescribed for 4 weeks. Carotid-femoral pulsewave velocity (cf-PWV) was measured at baseline and after 4 weeks' ofspironolactone or HCTZ treatment. Between-group differences were evaluated, andlogistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of cf-PWV increase and incident resistant hypertension. No significant differences inbaseline characteristics were observed between spironolactone and HCTZ groups.After 4 weeks' treatment, both systolic BP and cf-PWV were reduced moreprofoundly in spironolactone group versus HCTZ group (P_<_.05). Pearson andSpearman correlation analysis showed that age, diabetes mellitus, and HCTZ werepositively correlated with cf-PWV, while spironolactone was negatively withcf-PWV. Logistic regression analysis indicated that per 1-standard deviationincrease in cf-PWV was associated with 92% higher incidence of resistanthypertension. After adjusted for spironolactone, no significant associationbetween cf-PWV increase and incident resistant hypertension was observed,indicating that the adverse effect of arterial stiffness on resistanthypertension development might be reversed by spironolactone treatment. Insummary, uncontrolled hypertensive patients with spironolactone treatment appear to have better BP control and arterial stiffness improvement.",RCT,,,,Spironolactone,Hydrochlorothiazide,,,Uncontrolled hypertensive patients,Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity,
Metformin in non-diabetic hyperglycaemia: the GLINT feasibility RCT.,/pubmed/29652246,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of people with diabetes with metformin can reducecardiovascular disease (CVD) and may reduce the risk of cancer. However, it isunknown whether or not metformin can reduce the risk of these outcomes in people with elevated blood glucose levels below the threshold for diabetes [i.e.non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH)].OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of the Glucose Lowering In Non-diabetichyperglycaemia Trial (GLINT) and to estimate the key parameters to inform thedesign of the full trial. These parameters include the recruitment strategy,randomisation, electronic data capture, postal drug distribution, retention,study medication adherence, safety monitoring and remote collection of outcomedata.DESIGN: A multicentre, individually randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,pragmatic, primary prevention trial. Participants were individually randomised ona 1_:_1 basis, blocked within each site.SETTING: General practices and clinical research facilities in Cambridgeshire,Norfolk and Leicestershire.PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged __40 years with NDH who had a high risk ofCVD.INTERVENTIONS: Prolonged-release metformin (500_mg) (GlucophageÂ SR, Merck KGaA, Bedfont Cross, Middlesex, UK) or the matched placebo, up to three tablets perday, distributed by post.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment rates; adherence to study medication;laboratory results at baseline and 3 and 6 months; reliability and acceptability of study drug delivery; questionnaire return rates; and quality of life.RESULTS: We sent 5251 invitations, with 511 individuals consenting toparticipate. Of these, 249 were eligible and were randomised between March andNovember 2015 (125 to the metformin group and 124 to the placebo group).Participants were followed up for 0.99 years [standard deviation (SD) 0.30years]. The use of electronic medical records to identify potentially eligibleindividuals in individual practices was resource intensive. Participants weregenerally elderly [mean age 70 years (SD 6.7 years)], overweight [mean body mass index 30.1_kg/m2 (SD 4.5_kg/m2)] and male (88%), and the mean modelled 10-yearCVD risk was 28.8% (SD 8.5%). Randomisation, postal delivery of the study drugand outcome assessment using registers/medical records were feasible andacceptable to participants. Most participants were able to take three tablets perday, but premature discontinuation of the study drug was common (30% ofparticipants by 6 months), although there were no differences between the groups.All randomised participants returned questionnaires at baseline and 67% ofparticipants returned questionnaires by the end of the study. There was nobetween-group difference in Short Form questionnaire-8 items or EuroQol-5Dimensions scores. Compared with placebo, metformin was associated with smallimprovements in the mean glycated haemoglobin level [-0.82_mmol/mol, 95%confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to -0.24_mmol/mol], mean estimated glomerularfiltration rate (2.31_ml/minute/1.73_m2, 95% CI -0.2 to 4.81_ml/minute/1.73_m2)and mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (-0.11_mmol/l, 95% CI -0.25 to0.02_mmol/l) and a reduction in mean plasma vitamin B12 level (-16.4_ng/l, 95% CI-32.9 to -0.01_ng/l). There were 35 serious adverse events (13 in the placebogroup, 22 in the metformin group), with none deemed to be treatment related.LIMITATIONS: Changes to sponsorship reduced the study duration, the limitedavailability of information in medical records reduced recruitment efficiency anddiscontinuation of study medication exceeded forecasts.CONCLUSIONS: A large, pragmatic trial comparing the effects of prolonged-release metformin and placebo on the risk of CVD events is potentially feasible. However,changes to the study design and conduct are recommended to enable an efficientscaling up of the trial. Recommendations include changing the inclusion criteria to recruit people with pre-existing CVD to increase the recruitment and eventrates, using large primary/secondary care databases to increase recruitmentrates, conducting follow-up remotely to improve efficiency and including a run-inperiod prior to randomisation to optimise trial adherence.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN34875079.FUNDING: The project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full inHealth Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 18.

Anti-O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) immune responses following vaccination with oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR correlate with protection against cholera after infection with wild-type Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba in North American volunteers.,/pubmed/29624592,"BACKGROUND: Cholera is an acute voluminous dehydrating diarrheal disease causedby toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae O1 and occasionally O139. A growing body of evidence indicates that immune responses targeting the O-specificpolysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae are involved in mediating protection against cholera. We therefore assessed whether antibody responses against OSP occur aftervaccination with live attenuated oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR, and whethersuch responses correlate with protection against cholera.METHODOLOGY: We assessed adult North American volunteers (n = 46) who werevaccinated with 5 _ 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of oral cholera vaccine CVD103-HgR and then orally challenged with approximately 1 _ 105 CFU of wild-type V.cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961, either 10 or 90 days post-vaccination.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Vaccination was associated with induction of significantserum IgM and IgA anti-OSP and vibriocidal antibody responses within 10 days ofvaccination. There was significant correlation between anti-OSP and vibriocidalantibody responses. IgM and IgA anti-OSP responses on day 10 followingvaccination were associated with lower post-challenge stool volume (r = -0.44, P = 0.002; r = -0.36, P = 0.01; respectively), and none of 27 vaccinees whodeveloped a _1.5 fold increase in any antibody isotype targeting OSP on day 10following vaccination compared to baseline developed moderate or severe cholerafollowing experimental challenge, while 5 of 19 who did not develop such anti-OSPresponses did (P = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgRinduces antibodies that target V. cholerae OSP, and these anti-OSP responsescorrelate with protection against diarrhea following experimental challenge with V. cholerae O1.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01895855.",RCT,,,,Oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR,,,,Cholera,Serum IgM ,
[An efficacy and safety study of bifidobacterium tetragenous viable bacteria tablets in the treatment of constipation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].,/pubmed/29614582,"Objective: The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetes is higher than that of non-diabetes. Thus, the aim of the present study was to observe theefficacy and safety of bifidobacterium tetragenous viable bacteria tablets in thetreatment of constipation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods:This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup-comparison clinical research. The subjects were randomly divided into studygroup and control group according to 1_1 ratio by computer generated randomnumber method. The subjects were either treated with bifidobacterium tetragenous viable bacteria tablets (study group) or placebo (control group) for eight weeks,and they were followed up for four weeks without changing foundation therapy for diabetes. The primary outcome was the change of complete spontaneous bowelmovements (CSBMs). Results: A total of 234 subjects (the study group:116 cases;the control group: 118 cases) from 7 centers were included in the present study. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. In the studygroup, the CSBMs at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks were 0.0 (0.0, 1.0) , 1.0 (0.5, 2.0) , 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) , 3.0 (2.0, 3.5) , 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) times per week, respectively, while the CSBMs of the control group at each corresponding weeks were 0.0 (0.0,1.0) , 1.0 (0.0, 1.5) , 1.0 (0.0, 1.5) , 1.0 (0.0, 2.0) , 1.0 (0.0, 1.5) timesper week, respectively. There is significant difference in CSBMs between the two groups (P<0.05). Moreover, after 12 weeks treatment, the CSBMs over spontaneousbowel movements (SBMs) ratio in the study group was higher than that in thecontrol group [0.53 (0.40, 0.67) vs 0.33 (0.00,0.50), P=0.048], indicating a morecomplete evacuation sensation in the study group. More subjects in the studygroup (66.38%) reached Bristol stool classification of normal criteria than thosein the control group (48.31%, P=0.005). There were significantly improvement ofbowel function index in the study group [study group 42.7 (33.3, 56.7), controlgroup 60.6 (51.7, 75.7), P<0.000 1]. Furthermore, the symptoms of constipationwas improved, and the satisfaction for the treatment was high in the study group.There were no significant differences of the safety indicators between the twogroups.

[Effect of health literacy and exercise-focused interventions on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in China].,/pubmed/29609254,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of health literacy and exercise-focusedinterventions on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inChina. Methods: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, a total of 799 T2DM patients with most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) _ 7.5% (or fasting plasmaglucose level _10 mmol/L) were recruited from 8 communities in Minhang andChangning districts of Shanghai, and randomized into a health literacyintervention group, an exercise intervention group, a comprehensive intervention group and a control group. After baseline survey and examination, a one-yearintervention and 3 times (at 3(rd), 6(th), and 12(th) month) follow-up surveyswere conducted. Results: The follow-up rates for all the subjects were 99.4%,98.4% and 95.2%, respectively, at 3(rd), 6(th) and 12(th) month. Patients inintervention groups were more likely to achieve a goal HbA1c level (HbA1c <7.0%) than those in control group, with the highest glycemic control rate (25.3%)observed in comprehensive intervention group at 3(rd) month and then in exercise intervention group (25.3% and 34.6%) respectively, at 6(th) month and 12(th)month. The average levels of HbA1c in three intervention groups were lower ateach follow-up time point than those at baseline survey. However, the decreasesin HbA1c were obvious only at 6(th) month (P<0.001), with ls-mean (95%CI) of-0.48% (-0.71%, -0.25%), -0.33% (-0.55%, -0.11%) and -0.70% (-0.92%, -0.48%),respectively, in comprehensive, health literacy and exercise intervention groups,but it increased slightly by 0.03% (-0.19%, 0.25%) in control group.

Gut bacteria selectively promoted by dietary fibers alleviate type 2 diabetes.,/pubmed/29590046,"The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) productionfrom carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associatedwith type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized clinical study ofspecifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgunmetagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers werepresent in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvementin hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers ofmetabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide.

"A randomized, open-label, comparative, crossover trial on preference, efficacy, and safety profiles of lispro insulin u-100 versus concentrated lispro insulin u-200 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a possible contribution to greater treatment adherence.",/pubmed/29564932,"BACKGROUND: Several outstanding pharmacological advances making innovative drugs sophisticateddevices available during the last few years. Nevertheless too manypatients still disappointingly fail to meetthe metabolic targets suggested bycurrent guidelines. Incorrect insulin administration techniques may greatlyaffect metabolic control in T2DM people. The aim of our study was to compareglycemic control associated with a concentrated insulin analog preparation (U-200lispro) in people with T2DM to the one observed with standard U-100 lispro. Thesecondary endpoint of our study was patients' preference and performance ratings of U-200 lispro.METHODS: 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. They were also assessed forlimited joint mobility syndrome (LJMS),defined as limitation in at least twoanatomical areas of the dominant upper extremity. After a 4-weekstructuredinsulin injection education period. Half of them were randomized to U-100 lispro,half to U-200 and after 12¾weeks they were switched to the other preparation for 12¾weeks. At the end a questionnaire was also administered to investigate patientpreference.RESULTS: No significant variation in fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, severe or mildhypoglycemic rate and daily fast-acting insulin analog dose was observed withU-100 lispro while U-200 lispro treatment was associated with a significantimprovement of all the above mentioned parameters and with around 20% decrease ininsulin requirement. Moreover patients' answers to the questionnaire pointed out a higher preference for U-200 lispro for continuing treatment due to fewerdifficulties completing injection.DISCUSSION: The explanation of better metabolic results with the U-200 devicemight be the lower inner piston inertia and volume and shorter duration of acomplete injection.CONCLUSIONS: Checking for LJIMS before insulin prescription could be adopted as astandard practiceaimed at choosing the most suitable device for patient'sspecific characteristics and abilities. The use of U-200 lispro might improvetreatment adherence and metabolic control. This would also result intocostreduction by saving about half the amount of pens per year and of time spent toboth fill prescriptionand dump the pharmacy.",RCT,,,,Concentrated insulin analog concentration,Standard U-100 lispro,,,T2DM,Glycemic control,

Our SMARTERrandomized controlled trial demonstrated that a physician-delivered step countprescription strategy has measurable effects on daily steps, glycemic control,and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension. Inthis study, we aimed to understand perceived barriers and facilitatorsinfluencing successful uptake and sustainability of the strategy, from patientand physician perspectives.METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of physicians (n_=_10) and participants (n_=_20), including successful and lesssuccessful cases in terms of pedometer-assessed step count improvements. Themesthat achieved saturation in either group through thematic analysis are presented.RESULTS: All participants appreciated the pedometer-based monitoring combinedwith step count prescriptions. Accountability to physicians and support offeredby the trial coordinator influenced participant motivation. Those who increasedstep counts adopted strategies to integrate more steps into their routines andwere able to overcome weather-related barriers by finding indoor alternativeoptions to outdoor steps. Those who decreased step counts reported difficulty in overcoming weather-related challenges, health limitations and work constraints.Physicians indicated the strategy provided a framework for discussing physicalactivity and motivating patients, but emphasized the need for support from alliedprofessionals to help deliver the strategy in busy clinical settings.CONCLUSION: A physician-delivered step count prescription strategy was feasiblyintegrated into clinical practice and successful in engaging most patients;however, continual support is needed for maximal engagement and sustained use.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Sleep duration, obesity and insulin resistance in a multi-ethnic UK population at high risk of diabetes.",/pubmed/29526681,"AIMS: Investigating the association between sleep duration, obesity, adipokinesand insulin resistance (via Leptin:Adiponectin ratio (LAR)), in those at highrisk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).METHODS: Adults with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) were included. Fastingbloods for inflammatory biomarkers and glycaemic status, 2-h glucose,anthropometrics, objective physical activity, and self-reported sleep werecollected. The average number of hours slept in a 24_h period was categorised as _5.5, 6-6.5, 7-7.5, 8-8.5, and _9_h. Regression models were fitted with sleep(linear and quadratic) and logistic regression used for IGR and adjusted for age,sex, ethnicity, body mass index, waist circumference and objective physicalactivity.RESULTS: 2848 participants included (593 with inflammatory marker data). Shortsleep and long sleep duration were significantly independently associated withhigher body mass index (P_<_0.001), body weight (P_<_0.01), and waistcircumference (P_<_0.001). 6-7_h of sleep/24_h is associated with the lowestobesity measures. Fasting insulin and LAR were positively associated with sleepduration. Adiponectin levels were negatively associated with sleep duration.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the evidence of an association between shortand long sleep duration and indices of obesity. We demonstrate an independentrelationship between long sleep duration and insulin resistance.",N,,,,,,,,,,

A total of sixty clinically ascertained pre-diabetes cases and twenty-five healthy controls were included. Serum IGF-2 and binding proteins wereestimated using commercially available ELISA kit. All groups had a positivecorrelation between all serum parameters. Multinomial logistic regression showed that all the study parameters directly affected each other. The results could notprove any correlation between IGF-2 and its binding proteins during pre-diabetes stage.

"Modulation of the peripheral blood transcriptome by the ingestion of probiotic yoghurt and acidified milk in healthy, young men.",/pubmed/29489876,"The metabolic health benefits of fermented milks have already been investigatedusing clinical biomarkers but the development of transcriptomic analytics inblood offers an alternative approach that may help to sensitively characterisesuch effects. We aimed to assess the effects of probiotic yoghurt intake,compared to non-fermented, acidified milk intake, on clinical biomarkers and geneexpression in peripheral blood. To this end, a randomised, crossover study wasconducted in fourteen healthy, young men to test the two dairy products. For asubset of seven subjects, RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression inblood collected during postprandial tests and after two weeks daily intake. Wefound that the postprandial response in insulin was different for probioticyoghurt as compared to that of acidified milk. Moreover changes in severalclinical biomarkers were associated with changes in the expression of genesrepresenting six metabolic genesets. Assessment of the postprandial effects ofeach dairy product on gene expression by geneset enrichment analysis revealedsignificant, similar modulation of inflammatory and glycolytic genes after bothprobiotic yoghurt and acidified milk intake, although distinct kineticcharacteristics of the modulation differentiated the dairy products. The arylhydrocarbon receptor was a major contributor to the down-regulation of theinflammatory genesets and was also positively associated with changes incirculating insulin at 2h after yoghurt intake (p = 0.05). Daily intake of thedairy products showed little effect on the fasting blood transcriptome. Probioticyoghurt and acidified milk appear to affect similar gene pathways during thepostprandial phase but differences in the timing and the extent of thismodulation may lead to different physiological consequences. The functionalrelevance of these differences in gene expression is supported by theirassociations with circulating biomarkers.",RCT,,,,Probiotic yoghurt intake,Non fermented acidified milk intake,,,Healthy young men,Clinical biomarkers and gene expression in peripheral blood,
Exenatide once weekly for smoking cessation: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.,/pubmed/29480848,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of morbidity and premature mortality in the United States. Approved pharmacological treatments forsmoking cessation are marginally effective, underscoring the need for improvedpharmacotherapies. A novel approach might use glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)agonists, which reduce alcohol and drug use in preclinical studies. GLP-1 isproduced in the intestinal L-cells and in the hindbrain. The peptide maintainsglucose homeostasis and reduces food intake. Several GLP-1 agonists are usedclinically to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, but none have been tested inhumans to reduce smoking.AIMS: We will examine whether extended-release exenatide reduces smoking,craving, and withdrawal symptoms, as well as cue-induced craving for cigarettes.METHODS: We will enroll prediabetic and/or overweight treatment seeking smokers(n_=_90) into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive exenatide or placebo.All participants will receive transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and behavioral counseling. Abstinence from smoking (verified via expired CO level of _5_ppm), craving (Questionnaire of Smoking Urges score), and withdrawal symptoms (Wisconsin Scale of Withdrawal Symptoms score) will be assessed weekly during 6weeks of treatment and at 1 and 4 weeks posttreatment. Cue-induced craving forcigarettes will be assessed at baseline and at 3 weeks of treatment followingvirtual reality exposure.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We hypothesize that exenatide will increase the number ofparticipants able to achieve complete smoking abstinence above that achieved via standard NRT and that exenatide will reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms, aswell as cue-induced craving for cigarettes.",N,,Y,,,,,,,,

Effect of Low-Fat vs Low-Carbohydrate Diet on 12-Month Weight Loss in Overweight Adults and the Association With Genotype Pattern or Insulin Secretion: The DIETFITS Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29466592,"Importance: Dietary modification remains key to successful weight loss. Yet, noone dietary strategy is consistently superior to others for the generalpopulation. Previous research suggests genotype or insulin-glucose dynamics maymodify the effects of diets.Objective: To determine the effect of a healthy low-fat (HLF) diet vs a healthylow-carbohydrate (HLC) diet on weight change and if genotype pattern or insulinsecretion are related to the dietary effects on weight loss.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Diet Intervention Examining The FactorsInteracting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) randomized clinical trial included 609 adults aged 18 to 50 years without diabetes with a body mass index between 28and 40. The trial enrollment was from January 29, 2013, through April 14, 2015;the date of final follow-up was May 16, 2016. Participants were randomized to the12-month HLF or HLC diet. The study also tested whether 3 single-nucleotidepolymorphism multilocus genotype responsiveness patterns or insulin secretion(INS-30; blood concentration of insulin 30 minutes after a glucose challenge)were associated with weight loss.Interventions: Health educators delivered the behavior modification intervention to HLF (n_=_305) and HLC (n_=_304) participants via 22 diet-specific small group sessions administered over 12 months. The sessions focused on ways to achieve thelowest fat or carbohydrate intake that could be maintained long-term andemphasized diet quality.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was 12-month weight change anddetermination of whether there were significant interactions among diet type and genotype pattern, diet and insulin secretion, and diet and weight loss.Results: Among 609 participants randomized (mean age, 40 [SD, 7] years; 57%women; mean body mass index, 33 [SD, 3]; 244 [40%] had a low-fat genotype; 180[30%] had a low-carbohydrate genotype; mean baseline INS-30, 93 _IU/mL), 481(79%) completed the trial. In the HLF vs HLC diets, respectively, the mean12-month macronutrient distributions were 48% vs 30% for carbohydrates, 29% vs45% for fat, and 21% vs 23% for protein. Weight change at 12 months was -5.3 kgfor the HLF diet vs -6.0 kg for the HLC diet (mean between-group difference, 0.7 kg [95% CI, -0.2 to 1.6 kg]). There was no significant diet-genotype patterninteraction (P_=_.20) or diet-insulin secretion (INS-30) interaction (P_=_.47)with 12-month weight loss. There were 18 adverse events or serious adverse eventsthat were evenly distributed across the 2 diet groups.Conclusions and Relevance: In this 12-month weight loss diet study, there was no significant difference in weight change between a healthy low-fat diet vs ahealthy low-carbohydrate diet, and neither genotype pattern nor baseline insulin secretion was associated with the dietary effects on weight loss. In the context of these 2 common weight loss diet approaches, neither of the 2 hypothesizedpredisposing factors was helpful in identifying which diet was better for whom.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01826591.",RCT,,,,Healthy low fat diet,Healthy low carbohydrate diet,,,Adults aged 18 to 50 years without diabetes with a body mass index between 28 and 40,12 month weight change,
"Family history and obesity in youth, their effect on acylcarnitine/aminoacids metabolomics and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Structural equation modeling approach.",/pubmed/29466466,"BACKGROUND: Structural equation modeling (SEM) can help understanding complexfunctional relationships among obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD), family history of obesity, targeted metabolomics and pro-inflammatorymarkers. We tested two hypotheses: 1) If obesity precedes an excess of free fattyacids that increase oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, there wouldbe an increase of serum acylcarnitines, amino acids and cytokines in obesesubjects. Acylcarnitines would be related to non-alcoholic fatty disease thatwill induce insulin resistance. 2) If a positive family history of obesity andtype 2 diabetes are the major determinants of the metabolomic profile, therewould be higher concentration of amino acids and acylcarnitines in patients with this background that will induce obesity and NAFLD which in turn will induceinsulin resistance.METHODS/RESULTS: 137 normoglycemic subjects, mean age (SD) of 30.61 (8.6) yearsdivided in three groups: BMI<25 with absence of NAFLD (G1), n = 82; BMI>30 withabsence of NAFLD (G2), n = 24; and BMI>30 with NAFLD (G3), n = 31. Family historyof obesity (any) was present in 53%. Both models were adjusted in SEM. Familyhistory of obesity predicted obesity but could not predict acylcarnitines andamino acid concentrations (effect size <0.2), but did predict obesity phenotype.CONCLUSION: Family history of obesity is the major predictor of obesity, and the metabolic abnormalities on amino acids, acylcarnitines, inflammation, insulinresistance, and NAFLD.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Predictors of Thrombolysis Administration in Mild Stroke: Florida-Puerto Rico Collaboration to Reduce Stroke Disparities.,/pubmed/29459397,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild stroke is the most common cause for thrombolysisexclusion in patients acutely presenting to the hospital. Thrombolysisadministration in this subgroup is highly variable among different clinicians andinstitutions. We aim to study the predictors of thrombolysis in patients withmild ischemic stroke in the FL-PR CReSD registry (Florida-Puerto RicoCollaboration to Reduce Stroke Disparities).METHODS: Among 73_712 prospectively enrolled patients with a final diagnosis ofischemic stroke or TIA from January 2010 to April 2015, we identified 7746 cases with persistent neurological symptoms and National Institutes of Health StrokeScale _5 who arrived within 4 hours of symptom onset. Multilevel logisticregression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to identifyindependent predictors of thrombolytic administration in the subgroup of patientswithout contraindications to thrombolysis.RESULTS: We included 6826 cases (final diagnosis mild stroke, 74.6% and TIA,25.4%). Median age was 72 (interquartile range, 21); 52.7% men, 70.3% white,12.9% black, 16.8% Hispanic; and median National Institutes of Health StrokeScale, 2 (interquartile range, 3). Patients who received thrombolysis (n=1281,18.7%) were younger (68 versus 72 years), had less vascular risk factors(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia), had lower risk of priorvascular disease (myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, andprevious stroke), and had a higher presenting median National Institutes ofHealth Stroke Scale (4 versus 2). In the multilevel multivariable model, earlyhospital arrival (arrive by 0-2 hours versus _3.5 hours; odds ratio [OR], 8.16;95% confidence interval [CI], 4.76-13.98), higher National Institutes of HealthStroke Scale (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.77-1.98), aphasia at presentation (OR, 1.35;95% CI, 1.12-1.62), faster door-to-computed tomography time (OR, 1.81; 95% CI,1.53-2.15), and presenting to an academic hospital (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.39-2.95) were independent predictors of thrombolysis administration.CONCLUSIONS: Mild acutely presenting stroke patients are more likely to receivethrombolysis if they are young, white, or Hispanic and arrive early to thehospital with more severe neurological presentation. Identification of predictorsof thrombolysis is important in design of future studies to assess the use ofthrombolysis for mild stroke.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Peer support to improve diabetes care: an implementation evaluation of the Australasian Peers for Progress Diabetes Program.,/pubmed/29454327,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have now demonstrated the benefits of peer support inpromoting diabetes control. The aim of this study is to evaluate theimplementation of a cluster randomised controlled trial of a group-based, peersupport program to improve diabetes self-management and thereby, diabetes controlin people with Type 2 Diabetes in Victoria, Australia.METHODS: The intervention program was designed to address four key peer supportfunctions i.e. 1) assistance in daily management, 2) social and emotionalsupport, 3) regular linkage to clinical care, and 4) ongoing and sustainedsupport to assist with the lifelong needs of diabetes self-care management. Theintervention participants attended monthly group meetings facilitated by atrained peer leader for 12¾months. Data was collected on the intervention'sreach, participation, implementation fidelity, groups' effectiveness andparticipants' perceived support and satisfaction with the intervention. TheRE-AIM and PIPE frameworks were used to guide this evaluation.RESULTS: The trial reached a high proportion (79%) of its target populationthrough mailed invitations. Out of a total of 441 eligible individuals, 273(61.9%) were willing to participate. The intervention fidelity was high (92.7%). The proportion of successful participants who demonstrated a reduction in 5¾yearscardiovascular disease risk score was 65.1 and 44.8% in the intervention andcontrol arm respectively. Ninety-four percent (94%) of the interventionparticipants stated that the program helped them manage their diabetes on a dayto day basis. Overall, attending monthly group meetings provided 'a lot ofsupport' to 57% and 'moderate' support to 34% of the participants.CONCLUSION: Peer support programs are feasible, acceptable and can be used tosupplement treatment for patients motivated to improve behaviours related todiabetes. However, program planners need to focus on the participation component in designing future programs. The use of two evaluation frameworks allowed acomprehensive evaluation of the trial from the provider-, participant- and publichealth perspective.

Clinicians documented barriers(e.g. forgetting, routines, other concerns) in the subsample that reported misseddoses (N_=_423 [69.2%], 422 [72.4%], and 414 [78.9%] at 6, 12, and 24_months,respectively). Adherence strategies were also assessed (e.g. family, schedule,reminder device) using standard questions. Logistic regression was used toanalyze associations with medication adherence.RESULTS: Those missing doses were not different from the total sample (61.5%female, 13.9_±_2.0_years, >80% racial/ethnic minorities). No baseline demographicor clinical predictors of barriers to medication adherence were identified. Amongthose for whom barriers were assessed, ""forgetting"" with no reason named (39.3%) and disruptions to mealtime, sleep, and schedule (21.9%) accounted for thelargest proportion of responses.

Transcript basedanalysis generated 3 major mechanisms of action that led to improvedself-management of their SMI and DM: (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006) positive groupexperience, (Osborn et al., 2008) increased health knowledge, and (Newcomer,2005) increased self- confidence.CONCLUSIONS: Developing complex interventions for testing in RCTs of individuals with SMI and other comorbid conditions is of increasing importance in healthcare planning for this vulnerable population. Using qualitative methods to exploremechanisms of action underlying quantitative outcomes, can enrich ourunderstanding of processes relevant for individuals with SMI and comorbidconditions.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of the effects of a diabetes educational program: a randomized clinical trial.,/pubmed/29412378,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness of a diabetes mellitus educational program in primary health care.METHODS: This cluster randomized trial was conducted in a sample of 470 peoplewith type 2 diabetes mellitus from eight health units, randomly assigned to twogroups: intervention (n = 231) and control (n = 239). The intervention groupparticipated in the educational program composed of three strategies: groupeducation, home visit, and telephone intervention. Simultaneously, the controlgroup was monitored individually. Group monitoring took place over nine months inthe year 2012. Clinical evaluations were performed at the initial time (T0),three (T3), six (T6) and nine (T9) months after the beginning of theintervention.RESULTS: After nine months of follow-up, 341 users remained in the study, 171 in the control group and 170 in the intervention group. The average age of users was60.6 years. In both groups, statistically significant differences were observedin mean HbA1c levels over the follow-up time (p < 0.05). However, the mean HbA1c level at T3, T6 and T9 times were significantly lower among the people in theintervention group (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The educational program model developed was effective to improve theglycemic control of the intervention group participants.",RCT,,,,Diabetes mellitus educational program,Control,,,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Mean hba1c levels,
The potential long-term neurological improvement of early hyperbaric oxygen therapy on hemorrhagic stroke in the diabetics.,/pubmed/29408705,"AIMS: Although Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HyperBOT) attract our attentionsuccessfully these days, it is still full of controversy on the treatment ofacute stroke. The aim of this study is to assess the potential long-termneurological consequences and safety of using HyperBOT on intracerebralhemorrhage (ICH) in the diabetics.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, 79 diabetes patientssuffering from acute ICH were randomized to treat for 60_min in a monoplacehyperbaric chamber pressurized with pure oxygen to 2.5-atm absolute (ATA) in the HyperBOT group or 1.5 ATA in the normobaric oxygen therapy (NormBOT) group, whichwas performed as control. Both short-term and long-term neurological consequenceswere studied and compared in each group on National Institutes of Health StrokeScale [NIHSS], Barthel Index, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] and Glasgow OutcomeScale [GOS]. The related complications or side-events of all patients wererecorded as well at the final follow-up of six months after onset.RESULTS: No distinct difference was observed between each group at one monthfollow-up. However, in the long-term follow-up of six months, a higher frequency of patients in the HyperBOT group resulted into good outcome with a relative highneurological consequence compared with the NormBOT group (Barthel Index: 85.1%versus 65.6%, P_=_0.080; mRS: 89.4% versus 68.8%, P_=_0.045; GOS: 83.0% versus62.5%, P_=_0.073; NIHSS: 80.9% versus 56.2%, P_=_0.035).CONCLUSIONS: Early HyperBOT was found to be safe and effective with regards tothe long-term neurological outcome of diabetic patients suffering from ICH.",RCT,,,,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy,,,,Diabetes patients suffering from acute intracerebral hemorrhage,Long temr neurological consequences,

We did a study to observe the changes of GLP-1and _-cell function after short-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion(CSII) treatment.METHODS: A total of 66 subjects were enrolled, including 30 normal glucosetolerance controls (NGT) and 36 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetesbetween October 2015 and July 2016. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, andGLP-1 were measured in each subject. The patients underwent CSII treatment for2_weeks, and then FBG, insulin, and GLP-1 were measured. HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were then calculated.RESULTS: All patients achieved target glycemic control in two weeks. HOMA-IR and HOMA-B improved significantly after intensive interventions (p_<_0.05). The GLP-1concentration increased significantly in patients after treatment (p_<_0.05).When grouped according to bodyweight and age in all patients, the HOMA-IR changedsignificantly in overweight and old age subgroups, the HOMA-B increasedsignificantly in normal weight, overweight and middle age subgroups, and theGLP-1 concentration also increased significantly in overweight and middle agesubgroups respectively (p_<_0.05).CONCLUSION: Short-term CSII treatment can obtain glycemic control target andrecover _-cell function and GLP-1 secretion in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetespatients.

NC was measured at 11-13+6 gestational weeks. GDMwas diagnosed through a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 gestationalweeks. Using the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, weevaluated the association between NC and GDM.RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves were 0.65(95% CI: 0.60-0.70) for NC and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.59-0.69) for preBMI in diagnosing GDM and no difference was found between them (P = 0.66). NC _ 33.8cm wasdetermined to be the best cut-off level for identifying subjects with GDM(sensitivity 68.04% and specificity 59.12%). Multivariate logistic regressionanalysis showed that a large NC in the first trimester was an independent riskfactor for the development of GDM (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.72-7.45).CONCLUSIONS: NC, as well as preBMI, might be a novel anthropometric index for GDMscreening.

"I've made this my lifestyle now"": a prospective qualitative study of motivation for lifestyle change among people with newly diagnosed type two diabetes mellitus.",/pubmed/29386030,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis with Type 2 Diabetes is an opportunity for individuals tochange their physical activity and dietary behaviours. Diabetes treatmentguidelines recommend theory-based, patient-centred care and advocate theprovision of support for patient motivation but the motivational experiences ofpeople newly diagnosed with diabetes have not been well studied. Framed inself-determination theory, this study aimed to qualitatively explore how thispatient group articulate and experience different types of motivation whenattempting lifestyle change.METHODS: A secondary analysis of semi-structured interview data collected with 30(n female_=_18, n male_=_12) adults who had been newly diagnosed with type twodiabetes and were participants in the Early ACTID trial was undertaken. Deductivedirected content analysis was performed using NVivo V10 and researchertriangulation to identify and describe patient experiences and narratives thatreflected the motivation types outlined in self-determination theory and if/howthese changed over time.RESULTS: The findings revealed the diversity in motivation quality both betweenand within individuals over time and that patients with newly-diagnosed diabetes have multifaceted often competing motivations for lifestyle behaviour change.Applying self-determination theory, we identified that many participants reportedrelatively dominant controlled motivation to comply with lifestylerecommendations, avoid their non-compliance being ""found out"" or supress guiltfollowing lapses in behaviour change attempts. Such narratives were accompaniedby experiences of frustrating slow behaviour change progress. More autonomousmotivation was expressed as something often achieved over time and reflectedgoals to improve health, quality of life or family time. Motivationalinternalisation was evident and some participants had integrated their behaviour change to a new way of life which they found resilient to common barriers.CONCLUSIONS: Motivation for lifestyle change following diagnosis with type twodiabetes is complex and can be relatively low in self-determination. To achievethe patient empowerment aspirations of current national health care plans,intervention developers, and clinicians would do well to consider the quality notjust quantity of their patients' motivation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN92162869 .

[Effect of hyperandrogenism on obstetric complications of singleton pregnancy from in vitro fertilization in women with polycystic ovary syndrome].,/pubmed/29374881,"Objective: To compare the difference in risks of obstetric complications ofsingleton pregnancy between women with hyperandrogenic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women with normoandrogenic PCOS. Methods: Prospective cohort study.This study was a secondary analysis of data collected during a multicenterrandomized controlled clinical trial. Women who got clinical singleton pregnancy were grouped according to whether they were diagnosed with hyperandrogenism atbaseline. There were 118 women with hyperandrogenism and 366 women withouthyperandrogenism. The incidences of obstetric complications and birth weight werecompared between the two groups. Results: Women with hyperandrogenic PCOS had asignificantly higher risk of preterm delivery than women with normoandrogenicPCOS [12.7% (15/118) versus 3.6% (13/366); OR=3.94, 95%CI: 1.82-8.56]. Afteradjustment of age, duration of infertility, body mass index, and fresh or frozen embryo transfer group, hyperandrogenism was still associated with an increasedrisk of preterm delivery (OR=3.67, 95%CI: 1.67-8.07).

Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial of supervised resistance training versus aerobic training in Sri Lankan adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: SL-DART study.,/pubmed/29368598,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is rising globally. T2DM is particularly problematic in South Asiawith an estimated 10-15% of Sri Lankans diagnosed with the disease. Exercise isknown to improve blood glucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure and adiposity, keygoals in the management of T2DM. However, much of the evidence to date has beengained from white Caucasians who have a different body composition and diseaseprofile compared to South Asians. Similarly, the recreational exercise culture isnew to Sri Lankans and the effects of exercise on T2DM has not been studied inthis population.METHODS: The Sri Lanka Diabetes Aerobic and Resistance Training (SL-DART) Studywill be comprised of 2 components. Component 1 is a 12-week randomized controlledtrial (RCT) to compare the effects of a supervised progressive resistanceexercise program (RT) and aerobic exercise program (AT) with standardtreatment/control (CN). Sedentary Sri Lankan adults with T2DM (aged 35-65¾years) and with no contraindications to exercise will be randomized into one of 3 groups(AT, RT, CN). Exercise sessions will be conducted 2¾days/week for 3¾months.Baseline and post-intervention biochemical (glycemic control, lipid and liverprofiles, inflammatory markers), anthropometric (height, weight, bodycircumferences), body composition, physical fitness, food preference (liking and wanting food) and quality of life parameters will be measured and comparedbetween groups. Component 2 will be a qualitative study conducted immediatelypost-intervention via in-depth interviews to assess the barriers and facilitatorsfor adherence to each exercise program.DISCUSSION: SL-DART Study represents one of the first adequately poweredmethodologically sound RCTs conducted in South Asia to assess the effects ofresistance and aerobic exercise in participants with T2DM.

Structured peer-led diabetes self-management and support in a low-income country: The ST2EP randomised controlled trial in Mali.,/pubmed/29357380,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of peer-ledself-management education in improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in a low-income country (Mali).METHODS: We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial. A total of 151adults (76% women, mean age 52.5) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c_8%), treated in thediabetes consultation units of two secondary health centres in Bamako, wereallocated to peer-led structured patient education (n = 76) or conventional care alone (n = 75). The intervention group received 1 year of culturally tailoredstructured patient education (3 courses of 4 sessions) delivered in the communityby five trained peer educators. Both groups underwent conventional diabetesmonitoring and follow-up. Primary outcome was the mean absolute change in HbA1cfrom baseline to 12 months.RESULTS: 177 education sessions were delivered to the intervention group. Patientattrition was 8%. From baseline to 12 months, the decrease in HbA1c levels was1.05% (SD = 2.0; CI95%: 1.54;-0.56) in the intervention group compared with 0.15%(SD = 1.7; CI95%: -0.56; 0.26) in the control group, p = 0.006. Mean BMI changewas -1.65 kg/m2 (SD = 2.5; CI95%: -2.25; -1.06) in the intervention group and+0.05 kg/m2 (SD = 3.2; CI95%: -0.71; 0.81) in the control group, p = 0.0005.

"The effects of resveratrol on markers of oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.",/pubmed/29357033,"AIMS: Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of type 2diabetes (T2D). In vitro and animal studies have shown that resveratrol exerts anantioxidant effect, but clinical trials addressing this effect in patients withT2D are limited. The aim of this study was to determine whether resveratrolsupplementation affects oxidative stress markers in a randomized,placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.METHODS: A total of 48 patients with T2D randomly were assigned to receive800¾mg/day resveratrol or placebo for 2¾months. Plasma total antioxidantcapacity, malondialdehyde concentration, protein carbonyl and total thiolcontents, intracellular superoxide anion (O2-à) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inPBMCs, the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress responses (Nrf2, SOD,Cat, HO-1, RAGE, NOS) in PBMCs, and metabolic and anthropometric parameters were measured at the baseline and at the trial end.RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, resveratrol reduced plasma proteincarbonyl content and PBMCs O2-à level and significantly increased plasma totalantioxidant capacity and total thiol content. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2and SOD was significantly increased after resveratrol consumption. Resveratrolhad no significant effects on the metabolic and anthropometric parameters except for a significant reduction in weight, BMI, and blood pressure levels.Resveratrol was well tolerated, and no serious adverse event was occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that 8¾weeks of supplementation with800¾mg/day resveratrol has an antioxidant effect in the blood and PBMCs ofpatients with T2D.

The trial enrolled 240 morbidly obesepatients aged 18 to 60 years, who were randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy orgastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period (last follow-up, October 14, 2015).Interventions: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n_=_121) or laparoscopicRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (n_=_119).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was weight loss evaluated bypercentage excess weight loss. Prespecified equivalence margins for the clinical significance of weight loss differences between gastric bypass and sleevegastrectomy were -9% to +9% excess weight loss. Secondary end points includedresolution of comorbidities, improvement of quality of life (QOL), all adverseevents (overall morbidity), and mortality.Results: Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9] years; mean baselinebody mass index, 45.9, [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women), 80.4% completed the 5-yearfollow-up. At baseline, 42.1% had type 2 diabetes, 34.6% dyslipidemia, and 70.8% hypertension. The estimated mean percentage excess weight loss at 5 years was 49%(95% CI, 45%-52%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 57% (95% CI, 53%-61%) aftergastric bypass (difference, 8.2 percentage units [95% CI, 3.2%-13.2%], higher in the gastric bypass group) and did not meet criteria for equivalence. Complete or partial remission of type 2 diabetes was seen in 37% (n_=_15/41) after sleevegastrectomy and in 45% (n_=_18/40) after gastric bypass (P_>_.99). Medication fordyslipidemia was discontinued in 47% (n_=_14/30) after sleeve gastrectomy and 60%(n_=_24/40) after gastric bypass (P_=_.15) and for hypertension in 29%(n_=_20/68) and 51% (n_=_37/73) (P_=_.02), respectively. There was nostatistically significant difference in QOL between groups (P_=_.85) and notreatment-related mortality. At 5 years the overall morbidity rate was 19%(n_=_23) for sleeve gastrectomy and 26% (n_=_31) for gastric bypass (P_=_.19).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with morbid obesity, use oflaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared with use of laparoscopic Roux-en-Ygastric bypass did not meet criteria for equivalence in terms of percentageexcess weight loss at 5 years.

Diminished androgen and estrogen receptors and aromatase levels in hypogonadal diabetic men: reversal with testosterone.,/pubmed/29339527,"AIMS: One-third of males with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have hypogonadism,characterized by low total and free testosterone concentrations. We hypothesized that this condition is associated with a compensatory increase in the expression of androgen receptors (AR) and that testosterone replacement reverses thesechanges. We also measured estrogen receptor and aromatase expression.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlledtrial. Thirty-two hypogonadal and 32 eugonadal men with T2DM were recruited.Hypogonadal men were randomized to receive intramuscular testosterone or salineevery 2 weeks for 22 weeks. We measured AR, ER_ and aromatase expression inperipheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC), adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inhypogonadal and eugonadal males with T2DM at baseline and after 22 weeks oftreatment in those with hypogonadism.RESULTS: The mRNA expression of AR, ER_ (ESR1) and aromatase in adipose tissuefrom hypogonadal men was significantly lower as compared to eugonadal men, and itincreased significantly to levels comparable to those in eugonadal patients with T2DM following testosterone treatment. AR mRNA expression was also significantly lower in MNC from hypogonadal patients compared to eugonadal T2DM patients.Testosterone administration in hypogonadal patients also restored AR mRNA andnuclear extract protein levels from MNC to that in eugonadal patients. In theskeletal muscle, AR mRNA and protein expression are lower in men withhypogonadism. Testosterone treatment restored AR expression levels to thatcomparable to levels in eugonadal men.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, contrary to our hypothesis, the expression of AR, ER_ and aromatase is significantly diminished in hypogonadal men as compared toeugonadal men with type 2 diabetes.

Impact of sirtuin-1 expression on H3K56 acetylation and oxidative stress: a double-blind randomized controlled trial with resveratrol supplementation.,/pubmed/29330620,"AIMS: Sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) down-regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) hasbeen associated with epigenetic markers of oxidative stress. We herein aim toevaluate whether an increase in SIRT-1 expression affects histone 3 acetylationat the 56 lysine residue (H3K56ac) in T2DM patients randomly selected to receive either resveratrol (40 mg or 500 mg) or a placebo for 6 months. The primaryoutcome is changes in the H3K56ac level by variation in SIRT-1 expression and thesecondary outcome is the evidence of association between SIRT-1 level,antioxidant markers (TAS), and metabolic variables.METHODS AND RESULTS: At baseline, peripheral blood mononuclear cell H3K56acvalues among the SIRT-1 tertiles did not differ. At trial end, SIRT-1 levels weresignificantly higher in patients receiving 500 mg resveratrol. At follow-up,patients were divided into tertiles of delta (trial end minus baseline) SIRT-1value. Significant reductions in H3K56ac and body fat percentage were found inthe highest tertile as were increased TAS levels. A multiple logistic regression model showed that the highest delta SIRT-1 tertile was inversely associated with variations in H3K56ac (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.99), TAS (OR = 1.01; 95% CI1.00-1.02), and body fat percentage (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.96).CONCLUSIONS: We provide new knowledge on H3K56ac and SIRT-1 association in T2DM. These data suggest that boosting SIRT-1 expression/activation may impact redoxhomeostasis in these patients.

"AZP-531, an unacylated ghrelin analog, improves food-related behavior in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome: A randomized placebo-controlled trial.",/pubmed/29320575,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized byearly-onset hyperphagia and increased circulating levels of the orexigenicAcylated Ghrelin (AG) hormone with a relative deficit of Unacylated Ghrelin(UAG). AZP-531, a first-in-class UAG analog, was shown to inhibit the orexigenic effect of AG in animals, to improve glycemic control and decrease body weight in humans. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of AZP-531 in patientswith PWS for whom no approved treatment for hyperphagia is currently available.METHODS AND DESIGN: Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlledtrial. Forty-seven patients with genetically confirmed PWS and evidence ofhyperphagia received daily subcutaneous injections of AZP-531 (3 and 4 mg for50-70 kg and >70 kg body weight, respectively) or matching placebo for 14 days.Assessments included adverse events, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, theHyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ), patient-reported appetite, body composition andglycemic measures.RESULTS: AZP-531 was well tolerated. There was a significant improvement withAZP-531 versus placebo in the mean total score, the 9-item score and the severitydomain score of the HQ (p < .05). The highest reduction in the total and 9-itemscores was observed in AZP-531 subjects with the highest hyperphagia score atbaseline. Findings were supported by a reduction in appetite scores observed withAZP-531 only. Body weight did not change in both groups while a significantreduction in waist circumference and fat mass was observed only with AZP-531.AZP-531 significantly decreased post-prandial glucose levels in a baselineglucose dependent fashion.CONCLUSIONS: AZP-531 may constitute a new treatment strategy to improvehyperphagia and metabolic issues in patients with PWS. These findings supportfurther investigation in longer-term clinical trials.",RCT,,,,AZP-531,Placebo,,,Prader Willi Syndrome,Hyperphagia questionnaire,
"App-technology to increase physical activity among patients with diabetes type 2 - the DiaCert-study, a randomized controlled trial.",/pubmed/29316905,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity can decrease the risk of complications related todiabetes type 2. Feasible and scalable strategies to implement support for ahealthy lifestyle for patients in primary care are needed. The aim of theDiaCert-study is to evaluate a digital healthcare platform and the effect of a12-week long smartphone-app physical activity intervention aiming at increasingphysical activity (primary outcome) and improve levels of HbA1c (glycatedhemoglobin), blood lipids, blood pressure, body composition, as well as otherlifestyle factors and overall health in patients with diabetes type 2.METHODS/DESIGN: The DiaCert-study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial that will include 250 patients with diabetes type 2. At baseline, participants arerandomized 1:1 to intervention, i.e. use of the smartphone-app, during 12¾weeks, or to a control group receiving only standard care. Physical activity andsedentary behavior, is objectively measured using the Actigraph GT3X. Biomarkers including HbA1c and blood lipids are measured in fasting blood samples.Anthropometrics include height, weight, waist circumference and body composition,and a number of lifestyle factors including sleep, diet, self-efficacy, andquality of life, are assessed through an extensive questionnaire. Measurementsare made at baseline and at follow-up after 3, 6 and 12¾months.DISCUSSION: Using new technology, is one way to bridge the gap between whatpatients need and what health care can offer. This study evaluates a new digital health care platform and will show if use of a smartphone-app to promote dailysteps is an effective and feasible method to increase physical activity andimprove clinical markers in patients with diabetes type 2.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03053336 ; 7 Feb, 2017.",N,,Y,,,,,,,,
"The coaching on lifestyle (CooL) intervention for obesity, a study protocol for an action-oriented mixed-methods study.",/pubmed/29310640,"BACKGROUND: Combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs) have proved to be effectivein changing and maintaining behavioural lifestyle changes and reducing overweightand obesity, in clinical and real-world settings. In this CLI, lifestyle coaches are expected to promote lifestyle changes of participants regarding physicalactivity and diet. In the Coaching on Lifestyle (CooL) intervention, which takes a period of 8 to 10¾months, lifestyle coaches counsel adults and children aged4¾years and older (and their parents) who are obese or are overweight with anincreased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases or type II diabetes. Ingroup and individual sessions, themes such as physical activity, dietarybehaviours, sleep and stress are addressed. The aim of the present study is tomonitor the implementation process of the CooL intervention and to examine howthe lifestyle coaches contribute to a healthier lifestyle of the participants.METHODS: This action-oriented study involves monitoring the implementationprocess of the CooL intervention and examining the lifestyle changes achieved by participants over time, in a one-group pre-post design using mixed methods.Methods include semi-structured interviews, observations, document analysis,biomedical parameters and questionnaires.DISCUSSION: The added value of the CooL study lies in its action-orientedapproach and the use of mixed methods, including both qualitative andquantitative research methods.

Effects of Hypoglycemia on Circulating Stem and Progenitor Cells in Diabetic Patients.,/pubmed/29300991,"Context: Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the most common acute diabetic complication, and it significantly increases morbidity. In people with diabetes, reduction inthe levels of circulating stem and progenitor cells predicts adverse outcomes.Objective: To evaluate whether hypoglycemia in diabetes affects circulating stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).Design: We performed an experimental hypoglycemia study (Study 1) and acase-control study (Study 2).Setting: Tertiary referral inpatient clinic.Patients and Other Participants: Type 1 diabetic patients (Study 1, n = 19);diabetic patients hospitalized for severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia, matchedinpatient and outpatient controls (Study 2, n = 22/group).Interventions: Type 1 diabetic patients underwent two in-hospital sessions ofglucose monitoring during a breakfast meal with or without induction ofhypoglycemia in random order. In Study 2, patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia and matched controls were compared.Main Outcome Measure: Circulating stem cells and EPCs were measured by flowcytometry based on the expression of CD34 and kinase insert domain receptor(KDR).Results: In Study 1, the physiologic decline of CD34+KDR+ EPCs from 8 am to 2 pm was abolished by insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients. InStudy 2, diabetic patients hospitalized for severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia hadsignificantly lower levels of CD34+ stem cells and CD34+KDR+ EPCs compared withdiabetic inpatients or outpatient controls.Conclusions: In diabetic patients, a single mild hypoglycemic episode cancompromise the physiologic EPC fluctuation, whereas severe hypoglycemia isassociated with a marked reduction in stem cells and EPCs. These data provide apossible link between hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes of diabetes.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Soluble Leptin Receptor Predicts Insulin Sensitivity and Correlates With Upregulation of Metabolic Pathways in Men.,/pubmed/29300960,"Context: Plasma soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R) seems protective of gestationaland type 2 diabetes in observational studies, but the mechanisms are unknown.sOb-R is formed by ectodomain shedding of membrane-bound leptin receptors(Ob-Rs), but its associations with messenger RNA (mRNA) expression are scarcelyexplored.Objective: To explore associations between plasma levels of sOb-R and (1) insulinsensitivity, (2) mRNA pathways in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and (3)mRNA of candidate genes for sOb-R generation in adipose tissue and skeletalmuscle.Design and Participants: The MyoGlu study included 26 sedentary, middle-aged men who underwent a 12-week intensive exercise intervention. We measured plasma sOb-Rwith enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, insulin sensitivity with ahyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissuewith high-throughput sequencing.Results: Baseline plasma sOb-R was strongly associated with baseline glucoseinfusion rate (GIR) [_ (95% confidence interval), 1.19 (0.57 to 1.82) mg/kg/min, P = 0.0006] and GIR improvement after the exercise intervention [0.58 (0.03 to1.12) mg/kg/min, P = 0.039], also independently of covariates, including plasmaleptin. In pathway analyses, high plasma sOb-R correlated with upregulation ofmetabolic pathways and downregulation of inflammatory pathways in both adiposetissue and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, mRNA of LEPROT and LEPROTL1(involved in Ob-R cell surface expression) and ADAM10 and ADAM17 (involvedsOb-R-shedding) increased after the exercise intervention.Conclusions: Higher plasma sOb-R was associated with improved GIR, upregulationof metabolic pathways, and downregulation of inflammatory pathways, which may be possible mechanisms for the seemingly protective effect of plasma sOb-R onsubsequent risk of gestational and type 2 diabetes found in observationalstudies.",N,Y,,,,,,,,,
Peripheral Endocannabinoids Associated With Energy Expenditure in Native Americans of Southwestern Heritage.,/pubmed/29300902,"Context: The endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG),as well as the related acylethanolamide oleoylethanolamide (OEA), have beenimplicated in energy expenditure (EE) regulation and metabolic diseases. Muscle(fat-free mass) and fat (fat mass) are metabolically active compartments and maindeterminants of EE.Objective: To assess whether human muscle, adipose, and plasma endocannabinoidscorrelate with EE.Design: Muscle, adipose, and plasma AEA, 2-AG, and OEA concentrations weremeasured via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. EE was assessed by indirectwhole-room calorimetry.Setting: Clinical trial.Participants: Obese/overweight Native Americans of full (n = 35) and at leasthalf (n = 21) Southwestern heritage.Main Outcome Measures: Twenty-four-hour EE, sleeping EE (SLEEP), resting EE(REE), respiratory quotient (RQ), and macronutrient oxidation.Results: In full Natives, muscle AEA concentration correlated with SLEEP (r =-0.65, P = 0.004) and REE (r = -0.53, P = 0.02). Muscle 2-AG was associated with SLEEP (r = -0.75, P = 0.0003). Adipose OEA concentration correlated with RQ (r = -0.47, P = 0.04) and lipid oxidation (r = 0.51, P = 0.03). Plasma OEAconcentration was associated with SLEEP (r = -0.52, P = 0.04). After adjustmentfor major determinants, these lipids explained nearly 20% of the additionalvariance of the respective measure. Similarly, in Native Americans of at leasthalf Southwestern heritage, investigated lipids correlated with EE measures.Conclusion: Endocannabinoids in metabolically relevant peripheral tissuesexplained a large part of EE variation and may be involved in regulating EE.Dysregulation of peripheral endocannabinoids may predispose people to metabolicdiseases via an effect on EE and lipid oxidation.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cultural adaptation of a peer-led lifestyle intervention program for diabetes prevention in India: the Kerala diabetes prevention program (K-DPP).,/pubmed/29298703,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is now one of the leading causes ofdisease-related deaths globally. India has the world's second largest number ofindividuals living with diabetes. Lifestyle change has been proven to be aneffective means by which to reduce risk of T2DM and a number of ""real world""diabetes prevention trials have been undertaken in high income countries.However, systematic efforts to adapt such interventions for T2DM prevention inlow- and middle-income countries have been very limited to date. Thisresearch-to-action gap is now widely recognised as a major challenge to theprevention and control of diabetes. Reducing the gap is associated withreductions in morbidity and mortality and reduced health care costs. The aim ofthis article is to describe the adaptation, development and refinement ofdiabetes prevention programs from the USA, Finland and Australia to the State of Kerala, India.METHODS: The Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program (K-DPP) was adapted to Kerala,India from evidence-based lifestyle interventions implemented in high incomecountries, namely, Finland, United States and Australia. The adaptation processwas undertaken in five phases: 1) needs assessment; 2) formulation of programobjectives; 3) program adaptation and development; 4) piloting of the program andits delivery; and 5) program refinement and active implementation.RESULTS: The resulting program, K-DPP, includes four key components: 1) agroup-based peer support program for participants; 2) a peer-leader training and support program for lay people to lead the groups; 3) resource materials; and 4) strategies to stimulate broader community engagement. The systematic approach to adaptation was underpinned by evidence-based behavior change techniques.CONCLUSION: K-DPP is the first well evaluated community-based, peer-led diabetes prevention program in India. Future refinement and utilization of this approachwill promote translation of K-DPP to other contexts and population groups within India as well as other low- and middle-income countries. This same approach couldalso be applied more broadly to enable the translation of effectivenon-communicable disease prevention programs developed in high-income settings tocreate context-specific evidence in rapidly developing low- and middle-incomecountries.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry:ACTRN12611000262909 .

Effect of Hydrolyzed Infant Formula vs Conventional Formula on Risk of Type 1 Diabetes: The TRIGR Randomized Clinical Trial.,/pubmed/29297078,"Importance: Early exposure to complex dietary proteins may increase the risk oftype 1 diabetes in children with genetic disease susceptibility. There are nointact proteins in extensively hydrolyzed formulas.Objective: To test the hypothesis that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzedformula decreases the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in young children.Design, Setting, and Participants: An international double-blind randomizedclinical trial of 2159 infants with human leukocyte antigen-conferred diseasesusceptibility and a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes recruited fromMay 2002 to January 2007 in 78 study centers in 15 countries; 1081 wererandomized to be weaned to the extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and 1078 to a conventional formula. The follow-up of the participants ended on February 28,2017.Interventions: The participants received either a casein hydrolysate or aconventional adapted cow's milk formula supplemented with 20% of the caseinhydrolysate. The minimum duration of study formula exposure was 60 days by 6 to 8months of age.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was type 1 diabetes diagnosedaccording to World Health Organization criteria. Secondary outcomes included age at diabetes diagnosis and safety (adverse events).Results: Among 2159 newborn infants (1021 female [47.3%]) who were randomized,1744 (80.8%) completed the trial. The participants were observed for a median of 11.5 years (quartile [Q] 1-Q3, 10.2-12.8). The absolute risk of type 1 diabeteswas 8.4% among those randomized to the casein hydrolysate (n_=_91) vs 7.6% among those randomized to the conventional formula (n_=_82) (difference, 0.8% [95% CI, -1.6% to 3.2%]). The hazard ratio for type 1 diabetes adjusted for humanleukocyte antigen risk group, duration of breastfeeding, duration of studyformula consumption, sex, and region while treating study center as a randomeffect was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.5; P_=_.46).

Determinants of weight outcomes in type 2 diabetes prevention intervention in primary health care setting (the DE-PLAN project).,/pubmed/29291708,"BACKGROUND: Real life implementation studies performed in different settings haveproved that lifestyle interventions in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (DM2)can be effective, although the weight reduction results are typically modestcompared to randomized control trials. Our objective was to identify the factors that predict successful weight loss in a less intensive, lower budget, real life setting lifestyle diabetes prevention intervention.METHODS: Study participants (n_=_175) with increased DM2 risk (Finnish DiabetesRisk Score (FINDRISC)_>_14) but no diabetes at baseline received ten grouplifestyle counselling sessions, physical activity and motivation sessions during a ten-month intervention. Stepwise regression analysis was used to determinedemographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of successful weight reductiondefined as a reduction of _5% of the initial body weight.RESULTS: At 12¾months following the initiation of the intervention, 23.4% ofstudy participants lost _5% weight (mean loss of 7.9¾kg, SD_=_5.8). Increasedphysical activity (44% vs 25%, p_=_0.03), decreased total fat consumption (88% vs65%, p_=_0.006) and adherence to four-five lifestyle goals (71% vs 46%,p_=_0.007) were more often reported among those who managed to lose _5% weightversus those who did not. In a multivariate analysis, meeting the _5% weight lossgoal was most effective in individuals with a higher baseline BMI (OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.0-1.2), baseline and medium versus higher education (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2-24.7)and a history of increased glucose (OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-1.3). A reduction of total fat in the diet was an independent lifestyle predictor, increasing theprobability of successful weight loss by 3.8 times (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2-11.4).CONCLUSION: Baseline higher BMI, lower education and a history of increasedglucose predicted the successful weight loss among individuals with a high riskfor the DM2 following lifestyle intervention in a real life primary health caresetting. People who manage to lose weight more often adhere to lifestyle changes,while the reduction of total fat in diet independently predicts successful weightloss. Further studies exploring the predictors of success in implementationstudies in DM2 prevention should help health care providers redesigninterventions to improve their effectiveness and outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ID ISRCTN96692060 , registered 03.08.2016retrospectively.",N,Y,,,,,,,,,
"Longitudinal Changes in Insulin Resistance, Beta-Cell Function and Glucose Regulation Status in Prediabetes.",/pubmed/29289263,"BACKGROUND: The changes in insulin resistance and insulin secretion and theirassociation with changes in glucose regulation status in Asians with prediabetes remain uncertain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included Korean adults (aged 20-79 years) withprediabetes who underwent routine medical check-ups at a mean interval of 5years. Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 5.6-6.9mmol/l orHbA1c 5.7-6.4% (39-46mmol/mol). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cellfunction (HOMA-%B) indices were assessed by homeostasis model assessment.Incident diabetes was defined as FPG _ 7.0mmol/l, HbA1c _ 6.5% (48mmol/mol), orinitiation of antidiabetic medications.RESULTS: Among the 7,208 participants with prediabetes, 4,410 (61.2%) remained asprediabetes (control group), 2,123 (29.5%) reverted to normal glucose regulation (regressors), and 675 (9.4%) progressed to type 2 diabetes (progressors) after 5 years. Compared with the control group, the progressors had higher baselineHOMA-IR (2.48 ± 1.45 versus 2.06 ± 1.20, P < 0.001), but similar baseline HOMA-%B(74.6 ± 47.6 versus 73.1 ± 41.4, P=0.68).

Real-world flash glucose monitoring patterns and associations between self-monitoring frequency and glycaemic measures: A European analysis of over 60 million glucose tests.,/pubmed/29278709,"AIMS: Randomised controlled trials demonstrate that using flash glucosemonitoring improves glycaemic control but it is unclear whether this appliesoutside trial conditions. We investigated glucose testing patterns in usersworldwide under real life settings to establish testing frequency and associationwith glycaemic parameters.METHODS: Glucose results were de-identified and uploaded onto a dedicateddatabase once readers were connected to an internet-ready computer. Data between September 2014 and May 2016, comprising 50,831 readers and 279,446 sensorsworldwide, were analysed. Scan rate per reader was determined and each reader wassorted into twenty equally-sized rank-ordered groups, categorised by scanfrequency. Glucose parameters were calculated for each group, including estimatedHbA1c, time above, below and within range identified as 3.9-10.0_mmol/L.RESULTS: Users performed a mean of 16.3 scans/day [median (IQR): 14 (10-20)] with86.4 million hours of readings and 63.8 million scans. Estimated HbA1c gradually reduced from 8.0% to 6.7% (64 to 50_mmol/mol) as scan rate increased from lowest to highest scan groups (4.4 and 48.1 scans/day, respectively; p_<_.001).Simultaneously, time below 3.9, 3.1 and 2.5_mmol/L decreased by 15%, 40% and 49%,respectively (all p_<_.001).

Outcomes of Patients with Critical Limb Ischaemia in the EUCLID Trial.,/pubmed/29273390,"OBJECTIVES: Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) implies an increased risk ofcardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the optimal antithrombotic treatment is not established.DESIGN, MATERIALS, METHODS: The EUCLID trial investigated the effect ofmonotherapy with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in 13,885 patients with peripheralartery disease (PAD); the primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, myocardialinfarction, or ischaemic stroke. Patients planned for revascularisation oramputation within 3 months, were excluded. This analysis focuses on the subgroup with CLI, defined by rest pain (58.8%), major (9.0%) or minor (32.2%) tissueloss.RESULTS: In EUCLID, 643 patients (4.6%) had CLI at baseline. Diabetes mellituswas more common in the CLI group, while coronary disease, carotid disease, andhypertension were more common in the non-CLI group. A majority of CLI patients(62.1%) had only lower extremity PAD. In patients enrolled on the ankle brachial index (ABI) criteria, ABI was 0.55¾±¾0.21 (mean¾±¾SD) for those with CLI versus0.63¾±¾0.15 for those without CLI. The primary efficacy endpoint significantlyincreased among patients with CLI compared with those without CLI with a rate of 8.85 versus 4.28/100 patient years (adjusted for baseline characteristics hazard ratio [HR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.16-1.76]; p¾=¾0.0009). When acute limb ischaemiarequiring hospitalisation was added to the model, significant differencesremained (adjusted HR 1.38, [95% CI 1.13-1.69]; p¾=¾0.0016). The 1 year mortalitywas 8.9%. A trend towards increased lower limb revascularisation among those withCLI was observed. Bleeding (TIMI major, fatal, intracranial) did not differbetween those with and without CLI.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 5% of patients enrolled in EUCLID had CLI at baseline. Milderforms of CLI dominated, a result of the trial design. Patients with CLI had asignificantly higher rate of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity versus those without CLI. Further efforts are required to reduce the risk of cardiovascularevents in PAD, especially in patients with CLI.

Subsequent osmotic suppression to 298 (295; 301) mOsm/kg at the end ofphase 3 revealed markedly different decay kinetics between both peptides-anestimated initial half-life of copeptin being approximately 2 times longer thanthat of AVP (26 vs 12 minutes).Conclusion: Copeptin is released in equimolar amounts with AVP in response toosmotic stimulation, suggesting its high potential as an AVP surrogate fordifferentiation of osmotic disorders. Furthermore, we here describe the decaykinetics of copeptin in response to osmotic depression enabling to identify ahalf-life for copeptin in direct comparison with AVP.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Health Outcomes and Explant Rates After Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding: A Phase 4, Multicenter Study over 5 Years.",/pubmed/29265773,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the real-world safety and effectivenessof the LAP-BAND (Apollo Endosurgery Inc., Austin, Texas) adjustable gastricbanding system (LBS) for 5 years following implantation.METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, phase 4, multicenter study involved 652 patients who had implantation of the LBS system. The primary outcome was thepercentage of subjects who had LBS explant over 5 years. The secondary outcomesincluded the rate of reoperations, clinical and biochemical measures, andpatient-reported outcome measures over 5 years.RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 79.3% females with a mean age of 44 years and a mean BMI of 45.4 kg/m2 . The primary end point was met with an explant rateof 8.74% (95% CI: 6.6%-10.9%) at 5 years. The rates for completer-only analysisand imputed missing data analysis were 12.81% (95% CI: 9.7%-15.9%) and 12.85%(95% CI: 10.2%-15.5%), respectively. All were significantly lower than thehistoric rate of 39.4% (P_<_0.001). There were 43 patients who requiredreoperations or revisions excluding explants (6.6%). A mean weight loss of 18.7% was maximally achieved by 2 years, and weight loss was maintained through to 5years. All patient-reported outcomes showed improvement following LBS treatmentthroughout 5 years.CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the long-term safety and effectiveness of LBSfor the treatment of patients with obesity and its related conditions.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Sedentary Time and MRI-Derived Measures of Adiposity in Active Versus Inactive Individuals.,/pubmed/29265769,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional associationsbetween objectively measured sedentary time and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)-assessed adiposity in a population at high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and to determine whether associations are modified by the recommended levels ofmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).METHODS: Sedentary time and MVPA were measured objectively by usingaccelerometers. Linear regression models examined the association of sedentarytime with liver, visceral, subcutaneous, and total abdominal fat (quantified byusing MRI). Interaction terms determined whether results were consistent acrossactivity categories (active [>_150 min/wk of MVPA] vs. inactive [<_150 min/wk of MVPA]).RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four participants (age_=_64.0_±_7.1 years;male_=_65.3%; BMI_=_31.8_±_5.6 kg/m2 ) were included. Following adjustment, each 60 minutes of sedentary time was associated with 1.74 L higher total abdominalfat, 0.62 L higher visceral fat, 1.14 L higher subcutaneous fat, and 1.86% higherliver fat. When results were stratified by MVPA (active vs. inactive), sedentary time was associated with greater liver, visceral, and total abdominal fat in the inactive group only.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sedentary time is associated with higherlevels of inter- and intraorgan fat, but associations with liver, visceral, andtotal abdominal fat were stronger in those who do not reach the current exercise recommendations for health.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
SMS education for the promotion of diabetes self-management in low & middle income countries: a pilot randomized controlled trial in Egypt.,/pubmed/29258499,"BACKGROUND: Due to the ubiquity of mobile phones in low and middle incomecountries, we aimed to examine the feasibility of SMS education among diabeticpatients in Egypt, and assess the impact of educational text messages, comparedto traditional paper-based methods, on glycemic control and self-managementbehaviors.METHODS: We conducted a 12-week randomized controlled trial at Misr Universityfor Science & Technology hospital in Cairo-Egypt. Known as MUST diabetesawareness program, patients were included if they had diabetes, owned a mobilephone, and could read SMS messages or lived with someone that could read forthem. Intervention patients received daily messages and weekly remindersaddressing various diabetes care categories. We expected greater improvement intheir glycemic control compared to controls who only received paper-basededucational material. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c, measured bythe difference between endpoint and baseline values and by the number of patientswho experienced at least 1% reduction from baseline to endpoint. Key secondaryoutcomes included blood glucose levels, body weight, treatment and medicationadherence, self-efficacy, and diabetes knowledge. Data were analyzed usingANCOVA, chi-square, and t-tests.RESULTS: Thirty four intervention and 39 control patients completed the study.Over 12¾weeks, 3880 messages were sent. Each intervention patient received 84educational and 12 reminder messages plus one welcome message. Our primaryoutcome did not differ significantly (_ 0.290; 95% CI -0.402 to 0.983; p_=_0.406)between groups after 3¾months, demonstrating a mean drop of -0.69% and -1.05% in the control and intervention group respectively. However, 16 interventionpatients achieved the targeted 1% drop versus only 6 controls, suggesting clearassociation between study group and 1% HbA1c reductions (chi-square_=_8.655;df_=_1; p_=_0.003). Secondary outcomes seemed in favor of intervention patientsat endpoint, with considerable improvements in treatment and medicationadherence, self-efficacy, and knowledge scores.

DPP-4 Inhibitors Improve Diabetic Wound Healing via Direct and Indirect Promotion of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Reduction of Scarring.,/pubmed/29254987,"Patients with diabetes often experience multiple disease complications.Hypoglycemic agents can have both positive and negative effects on diabeticcomplications, which should be carefully assessed when personalized treatmentstrategies are developed. In this study we report that dipeptidyl peptidase 4inhibitors (DPP-4is), a group of widely used antihyperglycemic agents, canimprove diabetic wound healing, independent of their beneficial effects onglycemic control. In particular, DPP-4is promoted the migration andepithelial-mesenchymal transition of keratinocytes, directly and indirectly, byinducing stromal cell-derived factor 1_ production of fibroblasts in vitro and indiabetic mice. In addition, DPP-4is attenuated collagen synthesis and deposition,which may diminish scar formation. Furthermore, the results of a randomizedclinical trial (NCT02742233) involving 67 patients with type 2 diabetes supportedthe role of DPP-4i treatment in diabetic wound healing. Our findings support the application of DPP-4i as a preferred option for treating ulcers in patients with diabetes.",N,,,,,,,,,,
The Effect of Testosterone on Cardiovascular Biomarkers in the Testosterone Trials.,/pubmed/29253154,"Context: Studies of the possible cardiovascular risk of testosterone treatmentare inconclusive.Objective: To determine the effect of testosterone treatment on cardiovascularbiomarkers in older men with low testosterone.Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Setting: Twelve academic medical centers in the United States.Participants: In all, 788 men _65 years old with an average of two serumtestosterone levels <275 ng/dL who were enrolled in The Testosterone Trials.Intervention: Testosterone gel, the dose adjusted to maintain the testosteronelevel in the normal range for young men, or placebo gel for 12 months.Main Outcome Measures: Serum markers of cardiovascular risk, including lipids andmarkers of glucose metabolism, fibrinolysis, inflammation, and myocardial damage.Results: Compared with placebo, testosterone treatment significantly decreasedtotal cholesterol (adjusted mean difference, -6.1 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (adjusted mean difference, -2.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001), andlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (adjusted mean difference, -2.3 mg/dL; P =0.051) from baseline to month 12.

Nil Whey Protein Effect on Glycemic Control after Intense Mixed-Mode Training in Type 2 Diabetes.,/pubmed/29251686,"Although intense endurance and resistance exercise training and whey proteinsupplementation have both been shown to independently improve glycemic control,no known studies have examined the effect of high-intensity mixed-mode intervaltraining (MMIT) and whey supplementation in adults with Type 2 diabetes(T2D).PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine if peritraining whey proteinsupplementation combined with MMIT can improve glycemic control.METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 24 men (55.7 ± 5.6 yr) with T2D performed MMIT with whey (20 g) or placebo control for 10 wk.Glycemic control was assessed via glucose disposal rate during a euglycemicinsulin clamp, fasting blood glucose concentration, and homeostatic modelassessment of insulin resistance. Changes in peak oxygen consumption,1-repetition maximum strength, vastus lateralis muscle, and subcutaneous adipose thicknesses, and waist circumference were also assessed.RESULTS: Ten weeks of MMIT substantially improved glucose disposal rate by 27.5% (90% confidence interval, 1.2%-60.7%) and 24.8% (-5.4% to 64.8%) in the whey and control groups, respectively. There were likely and possible reductions infasting blood glucose by -17.4% (-30.6% to -1.6%) and homeostatic modelassessment of insulin resistance by -14.1% (-25.3% to 1.08%) in the whey group;however, whey effects were not clearly beneficial to glycemic outcomes relativeto the control.

Cardiovascular outcomes with canagliflozin - is it on the CANVAS?,/pubmed/29251018,"INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (the'gliflozins') promote the excretion of glucose from the kidney to lower HbA1c.Empagliflozin was the first gliflozin shown to improve cardiovascular and renaloutcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Areascovered: In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program,there were improvements in the primary cardiovascular and exploratory renaloutcomes with canagliflozin, compared to placebo. The safety outcome finding,which was of most interest, was that there was a higher risk of amputation oftoes, feet, or legs with canagliflozin than in the placebo group. This program isthe subject of this evaluation. Expert opinion: As canagliflozin has smallbeneficial effects in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in subjects withcardiovascular disease, it is not on the canvas. However, there are still severalquestions about canagliflozin that need to be answered before it is widely used, especially in comparison with other gliflozins; As amputations have only beenreported with canagliflozin in CANVAS, should other gliflozins be preferred? Ascanagliflozin has not been shown to be beneficial in subjects not takingdiuretics, should other gliflozins be preferred in this population? Clarificationis also needed as to whether canagliflozin increases the risk of non-fatalstroke, or not.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Cardiac Biomarkers in Youth with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Results from the TODAY Study.,/pubmed/29246363,"OBJECTIVES: To examine cardiac biomarkers over time in youth-onset type 2diabetes, and relate serum concentrations to cardiovascular disease risk factors,and left ventricular structure and function.STUDY DESIGN: TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents andYouth) was a multicenter randomized trial of 3 treatments including 521participants with type 2 diabetes, aged 10-17 years, and with 2-6 years offollow-up. Participants were 36% male, obese, and ethnically diverse. Annualserum concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin, tumor necrosisfactor (TNF)-_, receptors 1 and 2 were related to blood pressure, body massindex, hemoglobin A1c, and left ventricular ejection fraction, diastolicfunction, relative wall thickness, and mass.RESULTS: Elevated concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (_100_pg/mL), TNF-_(_5.6_pg/mL) and troponin (_0.01_ng/mL), were present in 17.8%, 18.3%, and 34.2% of the cohort, respectively, at baseline, and in 15.4%, 17.1%, and 31.1% at theend of the study, with wide variability over time, without persistence inindividuals or clear relationship to glycemia or cardiovascularstructure/function. TNF receptors concentrations were increased at baseline andnot significantly different from end-of-study concentrations. Adverseechocardiographic measures were more likely in the highest TNF receptor tertile(all P_<_.05): higher left ventricular mass (39.3_±_9.0_g/m2.7), left atrialinternal dimension (3.7_±_0.4_cm) and E/Em ratio, a measure of diastolicdysfunction (6.2_±_1.9). After adjustment for body mass index, theserelationships were no longer significant.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum concentrations of cardiac biomarkers were common inyouth with type 2 diabetes, but their clinical significance is unclear and willrequire further long-term study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT00081328.",N,Y,,,,,,,,,
Incremental Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Intensive Treatment in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Detected by Screening in the ADDITION-UK Trial: An Update with Empirical Trial-Based Cost Data.,/pubmed/29241888,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of early intensive treatment versus routine care in individuals with type 2 diabetes detected byscreening.OBJECTIVES: To derive a trial-informed estimate of the incremental costs ofintensive treatment as delivered in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of IntensiveTreatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care-Europe(ADDITION) trial and to revisit the long-term cost-effectiveness analysis fromthe perspective of the UK National Health Service.METHODS: We analyzed the electronic primary care records of a subsample of theADDITION-Cambridge trial cohort (n = 173). Unit costs of used primary careservices were taken from the published literature. Incremental annual costs ofintensive treatment versus routine care in years 1 to 5 after diagnosis werecalculated using multilevel generalized linear models. We revisited the long-termcost-utility analyses for the ADDITION-UK trial cohort and reported results forADDITION-Cambridge using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model and thetrial-informed cost estimates according to a previously developed evaluationframework.RESULTS: Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment over years 1 to 5averaged £29.10 (standard error = £33.00) for consultations with generalpractitioners and nurses and £54.60 (standard error = £28.50) for metabolic andcardioprotective medication. For ADDITION-UK, over the 10-, 20-, and 30-year timehorizon, adjusted incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 0.014,0.043, and 0.048, and adjusted incremental costs were £1,021, £1,217, and £1,311,resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £71,232/QALY, £28,444/QALY,and £27,549/QALY, respectively. Respective incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ADDITION-Cambridge were slightly higher.CONCLUSIONS: The incremental costs of intensive treatment as delivered in theADDITION-Cambridge trial were lower than expected. Given UK willingness-to-paythresholds in patients with screen-detected diabetes, intensive treatment is ofborderline cost effectiveness over a time horizon of 20 years and more.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Surgical Versus Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization in Patients With Diabetes and AcuteÎ¾Coronary Syndromes.,/pubmed/29241487,"BACKGROUND: Randomized trial data support the superiority of coronary arterybypass grafting (CABG) surgery over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) indiabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MV-CAD). However,whether this benefit is seen in a real-world population among subjects withstable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) isunknown.OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to assess the generalizabilityof the FREEDOM (Future REvascularization Evaluation in Patients with DiabetesMellitus: Optimal Management of Multi-vessel Disease) trial in real-worldpractice among patients with diabetes mellitus and MV-CAD in residents of BritishColumbia, Canada. Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of mode ofrevascularization (CABG vs. PCI with drug-eluting stents) in diabetic patientswith ACS and MV-CAD.METHODS: In a large population-based database from British Columbia, this studyevaluated major cardiovascular outcomes in all diabetic patients who underwentcoronary revascularization between 2007 and 2014 (n¾=¾4,661, 2,947 patients with ACS). The primary endpoint (major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events[MACCE]) was a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The risk of MACCE with CABG or PCI was compared usingmultivariable adjustment and a propensity score model.RESULTS: At 30-days post-revascularization, for ACS patients the odds ratio forMACCE favored CABG 0.49 (95%¾confidence¾interval [CI]: 0.34 to 0.71), whereasamong SIHD patients MACCE was not affected by revascularization strategy (oddsratio: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.71 to 3.01; pinteraction¾<0.01). With a median follow-upof 3.3 years, the late (31-day to¾5-year) benefit of CABG over PCI no longervaried by acuity of presentation, with a hazard ratio for MACCE in ACS patientsof¾0.67 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.81) and the hazard ratio for SIHD patients of 0.55(95% CI: 0.40 to 0.74; pinteraction¾=¾0.28).CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with MV-CAD, CABG was associated with a lowerrate of long-term MACCE relative¾to PCI for both ACS and SIHD.

Flapless vs flapped implant insertion in patients with controlled type 2 diabetes subjected to delayed loading: 1-year follow-up results from a randomised controlled trial.,/pubmed/29234747,"PURPOSE: To compare the outcome of dental implants placed followingfull-thickness flap surgery with flapless surgery in controlled type 2 diabeticpatients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 92 controlled type 2 diabetic patients, whoneeded missing mandibular first molars to be replaced by implants, were selected for a single-centre, parallel group, double-blinded randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: flap (46 patients) vs flapless (46 patients) implant placement. Implants were loaded with metal-ceramic crowns, 4 months after placement in both groups.OUTCOME MEASURES: Implant and crown success, complications, post-operative painand swelling, plaque index, sulcular bleeding index, pocket depth and HbA1clevel. Follow up examinations were made after 24 h, and on the third and seventh days for soft tissue healing, pain and swelling evaluation; then at 6 months and 12 months (after loading) for dental plaque, sulcular bleeding, pocket depth, andHbA1c level evaluation.RESULTS: After 16 months of implant placement, no dropouts occurred. Fiveimplants failed, two in the flap group and three in the flapless group (4.34% vs 6.52%, McNemar test P = 1, difference = 0.4457, 95% CI of difference = 4.554 to47.234). Seven prosthesis failures occurred, three in the flap group and four in the flapless group (McNemar test P = 1; difference = 0.4239; 95% CI of difference= 29.95 to 3.86).

After 24 h, the flapped group patients showedsignificantly greater pain compared with the flapless group (24 h: P = 0.017,difference = 0.37 and 95% CI = 0.673 to -0.067).

The gene-treatment interaction of paraoxonase-1 gene polymorphism and statin therapy on insulin secretion in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: Fukuoka diabetes registry.,/pubmed/29233102,"BACKGROUND: Although statins deteriorate glucose metabolism, theirglucose-lowering effects have emerged in some situations. Here, we assessedwhether these effects are a consequence of statins' interaction with paraoxonase (PON)1 enzyme polymorphism.METHODS: Adult Japanese type 2 diabetes patients (n_=_3798) were enrolled in across-sectional study. We used Q192R polymorphism of the PON1 gene as arepresentative single-nucleotide polymorphism and focused on the effects of thewild-type Q allele, in an additive manner. For patients with and without statintherapy, the associations of this allele with fasting plasma glucose (FPG),HbA1c, C-peptide, HOMA2-%_, and HOMA2-IR were investigated separately using alinear regression model, and were compared between groups by testinginteractions. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score tofurther control the imbalance of characteristics between groups.RESULTS: Among patients with statin therapy, there were linear associations ofthe number of Q alleles with decreased FPG and HbA1c, and with increased serum C peptide and HOMA2-%_ (all P_<_0.01 for trends), while such associations were not observed among those without statin therapy. These differences were statisticallysignificant only for serum C peptide and HOMA2-%_ (P_<_0.01 for interactions).These associations remained significant after multiple explanatory variableadjustment. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score showed broad consistency of these associations.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the Q allele of the PON1 Q192R polymorphism who weretreated with statins exhibited improvement in glucose metabolism, especially ininsulin secretion, suggesting the importance of genotyping PON1 Q192R to identifythose who could benefit from statin therapy.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Prophylactic role of vitamin K supplementation on vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes by regulating the NF-Ô_B/Nrf2 pathway via activating Gla proteins.,/pubmed/29227493,"There is no previous study that has examined the relationship between circulatingvitamin K1 (VK1) and vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This studyaims to examine the hypothesis that circulating VK1 deficiency may be associated with higher inflammation and insulin resistance in T2D patients and that VK1supplementation regulates the NF-_B/Nrf2 pathway via activating VK-dependent Gla proteins and reduces vascular inflammation. The results showed that plasma VK1levels were significantly lower and MCP-1, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulinresistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher in T2D patients compared to those in the controls. The lower levels of VK1 in T2D patients were significantly andinversely correlated with MCP-1 and HOMA-IR, which suggests that VK1supplementation may reduce the vascular inflammation and insulin resistance inT2D. Using a high fat diet-fed T2D mice model this study further demonstratedthat VK1 supplementation (1, 3, 5 _g per kg BW, 8 weeks) dose-dependentlydecreased the body weight gain, glucose intolerance, fasting glucose, glycatedhemoglobin, HOMA-IR, and cytokine secretion (MCP-1 and IL-6) in T2D mice. Furthercell culture studies showed that VK1 supplementation (1, 5, or 10 nM) decreasedNF-_B phosphorylation and MCP-1 secretion and increased Nrf2 protein expressionin high glucose (HG, 25 mM)-treated monocytes. Signal silencing studies with GGCXsiRNA again depicted the role of VK-dependent Gla proteins in mediating theeffect of VK1 on vascular inflammation in HG-treated cells. In conclusion, thisstudy suggests that circulating VK1 has a positive effect in lowering vascularinflammation in T2D by regulating NF-_B/Nrf2 transcription factors via activatingVK-dependent Gla proteins.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Homocysteine as a non-classical risk factor for atherosclerosis in relation to pharmacotherapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,/pubmed/29222856,"AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate which of the pharmacotherapeuticmethods that are frequently used to treat type 2 diabetes is associated with the most beneficial profile in relation to pro-atherogenic homocysteine levels.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured the serum homocysteine level in 182 patientswith type 2 diabetes treated with metformin (89), treated with insulin incombination with metformin (31), receiving sulfonylureas (31) and treatedconventionally with insulin (31). The total homocysteine levels in the serum wereassayed. To exclude the influence of selected metabolic and anthropometricfactors on the differences between the examined groups, multivariate analysis of covariance was used (ANCOVA). In this analysis, serum homocysteine concentration was the dependent variable, while diabetes duration, waist circumference, HbA1c, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, fasting glycaemia and peptide C were used as covariates.RESULTS: The serum homocysteine levels in patients treated with insulin inmonotherapy were significantly higher than what was observed in the metformintreated subjects and in the patients receiving insulin combined with metformin.The analysis of covariance also confirmed that the differences between thetherapeutic groups were affected by waist circumference and the C-peptide levels.CONCLUSION: We conclude that conventional insulin therapy may have a negativeeffect on pro-atherogenic homocysteine levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.This study revealed that pro-atherogenic homocysteine levels may not only bemodified by pharmacotherapy of type 2 diabetes, but also by beta cell secretoryfunction and abdominal obesity.",N,,,Y,,,,,,,
Sitosterol prevents obesity-related chronic inflammation.,/pubmed/29221711,"The physiological roles of phytosterols in chronic inflammation, which arebelieved to be involved in the underlying mechanisms for metabolic diseases, haveyet to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological roles of phytosterols in both clinical studies and animalexperiments. We observed the existence of rather specific negative correlationsbetween the serum sitosterol level and the serum IL-6 and the TNF-_ levels inboth diabetic subjects (n=46) and non-diabetic subjects (n=178). Multipleregression analyses also revealed that the serum IL-6 and TNF-_ levels exhibited strong negative correlations with the serum sitosterol levels. When ABCG5/8 KOmice with markedly elevated plasma sitosterol levels and ABCG5/8 hetero mice werefed a high-fat diet, we observed that the increase in body weight, the fattyliver changes, and the expansion of perigonadal adipose tissues were suppressedin ABCG5/8 KO mice without any modulation of food intake. We also observed thatthe plasma IL-6 and TNF-_ levels, the expressions of TNF-_ and PAI-1 in the liverand the expressions of the IL-6, TNF-_, and MCP-1 levels in the adipose tissuewere lower in ABCG5/8 KO mice. These results suggest that sitosterol mightsuppress obesity-related chronic inflammation and might be applicable to thetreatment of metabolic diseases.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Primary care-led weight management for remission of type 2 diabetes (DiRECT): an open-label, cluster-randomised trial.",/pubmed/29221645,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disorder that requires lifelongtreatment. We aimed to assess whether intensive weight management within routine primary care would achieve remission of type 2 diabetes.METHODS: We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial (DiRECT) at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. Practices wererandomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated list, to provide either aweight management programme (intervention) or best-practice care by guidelines(control), with stratification for study site (Tyneside or Scotland) and practicelist size (>5700 or _5700). Participants, carers, and research assistants whocollected outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation wasconcealed from the study statistician. We recruited individuals aged 20-65 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past 6 years, had abody-mass index of 27-45 kg/m2, and were not receiving insulin. The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total dietreplacement (825-853 kcal/day formula diet for 3-5 months), stepped foodreintroduction (2-8 weeks), and structured support for long-term weight lossmaintenance. Co-primary outcomes were weight loss of 15 kg or more, and remissionof diabetes, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 6à5% (<48mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic medications, from baselineto 12 months. These outcomes were analysed hierarchically. This trial isregistered with the ISRCTN registry, number 03267836.FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 2017, we recruited 306 individualsfrom 49 intervention (n=23) and control (n=26) general practices; 149participants per group comprised the intention-to-treat population. At 12 months,we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24%) participants in theintervention group and no participants in the control group (p<0à0001). Diabetes remission was achieved in 68 (46%) participants in the intervention group and six(4%) participants in the control group (odds ratio 19à7, 95% CI 7à8-49à8;p<0à0001). Remission varied with weight loss in the whole study population, with achievement in none of 76 participants who gained weight, six (7%) of 89participants who maintained 0-5 kg weight loss, 19 (34%) of 56 participants with 5-10 kg loss, 16 (57%) of 28 participants with 10-15 kg loss, and 31 (86%) of 36 participants who lost 15 kg or more. Mean bodyweight fell by 10à0 kg (SD 8à0) in the intervention group and 1à0 kg (3à7) in the control group (adjusted difference-8à8 kg, 95% CI -10à3 to -7à3; p<0à0001). Quality of life, as measured by theEuroQol 5 Dimensions visual analogue scale, improved by 7à2 points (SD 21à3) inthe intervention group, and decreased by 2à9 points (15à5) in the control group(adjusted difference 6à4 points, 95% CI 2à5-10à3; p=0à0012). Nine serious adverseevents were reported by seven (4%) of 157 participants in the intervention group and two were reported by two (1%) participants in the control group. Two serious adverse events (biliary colic and abdominal pain), occurring in the sameparticipant, were deemed potentially related to the intervention. No seriousadverse events led to withdrawal from the study.INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that, at 12 months, almost half of participantsachieved remission to a non-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs. Remission of type 2 diabetes is a practical target for primary care.FUNDING: Diabetes UK.",RCT,,,,Weight management programme,Best practice care by guidelines,,,Type 2 diabetes,Weight loss of 15 KG or more,
"Androgens, Irregular Menses, and Risk of Diabetes and Coronary Artery Calcification in the Diabetes Prevention Program.",/pubmed/29220533,"Context: It is unclear whether relative elevations in androgens or irregularmenses (IM) are associated with greater cardiometabolic risk among women who are already overweight and glucose intolerant.Research Design and Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the DiabetesPrevention Program (DPP) and the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study(DPPOS). Participants included women with sex hormone measurements who did notuse exogenous estrogen (n = 1422). We examined whether free androgen index (FAI) or IM was associated with diabetes risk during the DPP/DPPOS or with coronaryartery calcification (CAC) at DPPOS year 10. Models were adjusted for menopausal status, age, race or ethnicity, randomization arm, body mass index (BMI), andhemoglobin A1c.Results: Women had an average age of 48.2 ± 9.9 years. Elevations in FAI and IMwere associated with greater BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure andlower adiponectin. FAI was not associated with diabetes risk during the DPP/DPPOS[hazard ratio (HR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93 to 1.02] or increasedodds of CAC [odds ratio (OR) 1.06; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.23]. IM was also notassociated with diabetes risk during the DPP/DPPOS (HR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87 to1.31) or increased odds of CAC (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.49). Women who hadboth relative elevations in FAI and IM had similar diabetes risk and odds of CAC as women without these conditions. Differences by treatment arm and menopausalstatus were not observed.Conclusions: Among midlife women who were already glucose intolerant andoverweight, androgen concentrations and IM did not additionally contribute toincreased risk for diabetes or CAC.",N,,,,,,,,,,
Intensive dietary intervention promoting the Mediterranean diet in people with high cardiometabolic risk: a non-randomized study.,/pubmed/29218417,"AIMS: Mediterranean diet (MD) is acknowledged to exert a number of beneficialhealth effects. We assessed the efficacy and the durability of a 3-monthintensive dietary intervention aimed at implementing the MD on body weight andcardiometabolic risk factors in subjects at high risk.METHODS: One hundred and sixteen subjects participated in the study (71 assigned to the intensive intervention and 45 to the conventional intervention). Theintensive intervention consisted of 12 weekly group educational meetings and afree-of-charge supply of meals prepared according to the MD model. Theconventional intervention consisted of an individual education session along withmonthly reinforcements of nutritional messages by the general practitioner. Allparticipants were followed up for 9¾months.RESULTS: The two groups had similar pre-intervention characteristics. After theintervention, mean body weight decreased significantly in both groups(p¾<¾0.001). However, the intervention group lost more weight (6.8¾±¾4.0 vs.0.7¾±¾1.3, p¾<¾0.0001) and showed a greater reduction in plasma glucose,triglycerides, blood pressure and an increase in HDL cholesterol than the controlgroup (p¾<¾0.01-p¾<¾0.002). In the subgroup of participants with type 2 diabetes,there was a significant reduction in HbA1c level following the intensive(p¾<¾0.0001) but not the conventional intervention. At follow-up, weight lossstill persisted in the intervention group (p¾<¾0.0001), while it was lost in the control group. Both interventions significantly reduced blood pressure in thelong term (p¾<¾0.001). A significant reduction in daily total energy intake wasobserved in both groups with a greater reduction in saturated fat and a higherincrease in fibre intake in the intervention than in the control group (p¾<¾0.009and p¾<¾0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: A 3-month intensive dietary intervention inspired to the traditionalMD produced greater and more durable weight loss and improvement incardiometabolic risk profile than the conventional intervention.",RCT,,,,Intensive dietary intervention promoting the Mediterranian diet,Conventional intervention,,,People with high cardiometabolic risk,Body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors,
A randomized controlled trial of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy vs. gastroduodenostomy with respect to the improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus after distal gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients.,/pubmed/29216250,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of diabetes control induced byRoux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy(RY) vs Billroth-I reconstruction(BI) after distalgastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer(EGC) and type 2 diabetes(T2DM).Forty EGC patients with T2DM, aged 20-80 years, who were expected to undergocurative distal gastrectomy were randomized 1:1 to RY(n = 20) or BI(n = 20).Diabetes medication status, biochemical and hormonal data including bloodglucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, and GIPwere evaluated for 12 months after surgery. Although pre- and postoperative12-month fasting and postprandial glucose levels did not show a significantdifference, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR levels were significantly improved at12 months after surgery in both BI and RY groups. Sixty percent of RY patientsand 20% of BI patients decreased their medication satisfying FBS<126 mg/dL andHbA1c<6.5% and 5% of BI patients stopped their medication satisfying the criteriaof FBS<126 mg/dL and HbA1c<6.0%. The improvement patterns were more sustainablewith less fluctuation in RY than in BI. On hormonal analysis, ghrelin and leptin levels were decreased and PYY and GIP levels were increased at 12 months aftersurgery in both groups without significant difference according to thereconstruction type and diabetic improvement status except ghrelin. In gastriccancer surgery, RY reconstruction showed better and more durable diabetes controlcompared to BI during the first year after surgery.

Pramlintide but Not Liraglutide Suppresses Meal-Stimulated Glucagon Responses in Type 1 Diabetes.,/pubmed/29211871,"Context: Postprandial hyperglycemia remains a challenge in type 1 diabetes (T1D) due, in part, to dysregulated increases in plasma glucagon levels after meals.Objective: This study was undertaken to examine whether 3 to 4 weeks of therapywith pramlintide or liraglutide might help to blunt postprandial hyperglycemia inT1D by suppressing plasma glucagon responses to mixed-meal feedings.Design: Two parallel studies were conducted in which participants underwentmixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) without premeal bolus insulin administrationbefore and after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with either pramlintide (8participants aged 20 ± 3 years, hemoglobin A1c 6.9 ± 0.5%) or liraglutide (10participants aged 22 ± 3 years, hemoglobin A1c 7.6 ± 0.9%).Results: Compared with pretreatment responses to the MMTT, treatment withpramlintide reduced the peak increment in glucagon from 32 ± 16 to 23 ± 12 pg/mL (P < 0.02). In addition, the incremental area under the plasma glucagon curvefrom 0 to 120 minutes dropped from 1988 ± 590 to 737 ± 577 pg/mL/min (P < 0.001),which was accompanied by a similar reduction in the meal-stimulated increase inthe plasma glucose curve from 11,963 ± 1424 mg/dL/min pretreatment vs 2493 ± 1854mg/dL/min after treatment (P < 0.01). In contrast, treatment with liraglutide hadno effect on plasma glucagon and glucose responses during the MMTT.Conclusions: Adjunctive treatment with pramlintide may provide an effective meansto blunt postmeal hyperglycemia in T1D by suppressing dysregulated plasmaglucagon responses.

Prophylactic Use of Haloperidol and Changes in Glucose Levels in Hospitalized Older Patients.,/pubmed/29210808,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with antipsychotic drugs has been associated with glucosedysregulation in older outpatients, especially in the early stage of therapy. Theunderlying mechanism is, however, unclear. The aim of this study was toinvestigate changes in glucose levels during haloperidol use compared with theuse of placebo among older hospitalized patients.METHODS: This substudy was part of a larger multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical trial among hospitalized patients aged 70years and older who had an increased risk of in-hospital delirium. Patients whowere admitted to the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in 's-Hertogenbosch between June 2014 and February 2015 were invited to participate in the study. Participatingpatients were randomized for treatment and given 1 mg of haloperidol or a placebotwice daily for a maximum of 7 consecutive days (14 doses). Exclusion criteriafor this substudy were the use of corticosteroids and changes in diabetesmedication. Random blood samples to determine glucose levels were collectedbefore day 1 and on day 6 of the study.

Teleconsultation in type 1 diabetes mellitus (TELEDIABE).,/pubmed/29209814,"AIMS: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care. Telemedicine offers anacknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasingpatient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemiccontrol of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.METHODS: A randomized open-label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conductedin two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetesmellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard ora web-based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange theirappointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses orto nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was theassessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12-month follow-up.RESULTS: Overall 74 participants were followed for 1¾year.

Using Ice Cream for Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus and Impaired Glucose Tolerance: An Alternative to the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.,/pubmed/29208255,"BACKGROUND: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a sensitive and reliable testfor diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). However, poor patienttolerance of glucose solutions is common. We aim to compare the diagnostic value of an ice cream test with a standard OGTT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 healthy adults were randomly assigned toeither 75-g OGTT or ice cream, followed by a crossover to the other test.RESULTS: Most patients were females (71%). Mean age was 37 ± 12 years, and bodymass index was 24.2 ± 3.9kg/m2. Diabetes mellitus and IGT, as diagnosed by 75-gOGTT, were 4.8% and 6.7%, respectively. The 2-hour plasma glucose levels were 110± 55.5mg/dL with 75-g glucose and 97.52 ± 40.7mg/dL with ice cream. Thecorrelation coefficient of 2-hour plasma glucose for the 2 tests was 0.82 (95%CI: 0.75-0.87; P < 0.001). Discordant diagnostic results, based on 2-hour plasma glucose levels, were 9.61%. By using a combination of fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour plasma glucose values, the ice cream test would have missed 5.76% of thoseat high risk for diabetes mellitus (impaired fasting glucose and IGT) ordiabetes.CONCLUSIONS: An ice cream test may serve as an alternative to a 75-g OGTT.

One year follow-up after a randomized controlled trial of a 130 g/day low-carbohydrate diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor glycemic control.,/pubmed/29206237,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently, we conducted a prospective randomized controlledtrial (RCT) showing that a 6-month 130g/day low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reducedHbA1c and BMI more than a calorie restricted diet (CRD). [1] To assess whetherthe benefits of the LCD persisted after the intensive intervention, we comparedHbA1c and BMI between the LCD and CRD groups at 1 year after the end of the6-month RCT.METHODS: Following the end of the 6-month RCT, patients were allowed to managetheir own diets with periodic outpatient visits. One year later, we analyzedclinical and nutrition data.RESULTS: Of the 66 participants in the original study, 27 in the CRD group and 22in the LCD group completed this trial. One year after the end of the originalRCT, the carbohydrate intake was comparable between the groups (215 [189-243]/dayin the CRD group and 214 (176-262) g/day in the LCD group). Compared with thebaseline data, HbA1c and BMI were decreased in both groups (CRD: HbA1c -0.4 [-0.9to 0.3] % and BMI -0.63 [-1.20 to 0.18] kg/m2; LCD: HbA1c -0.35 [-1.0 to 0.35] % and BMI -0.77 [-1.15 to -0.12] kg/m2). There were no significant differences inHbA1c and BMI between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: One year after the diet therapy intervention, the beneficial effect of the LCD on reduction of HbA1c and BMI did not persist in comparison with CRD. However, combining the data of both groups, significant improvements in HbA1c andBMI from baseline were observed.

Objectively-assessed physical activity and weight change in young adults: a randomized controlled trial.,/pubmed/29202850,"BACKGROUND: Reductions in physical activity (PA) are common throughout youngadulthood and low PA is associated with weight gain. The SNAP Trial previouslyreported that two self-regulation approaches to weight gain prevention reducedweight gain over a 2-year period in 18-35¾year olds. Presented here are secondaryanalyses examining changes in PA and the relationship between PA and weightchange over 2¾years.METHODS: 599 young adults (age: 27.4_±_4.4¾yrs.; BMI: 25.4_±_2.6¾kg/m2) wererandomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Small Changes (reduce calorie intake by 100 kcals/day & add 2000 steps/day), Large Changes (lose 2.3-4.5¾kg initially & increase PA to _250¾min/wk), or Self-guided (control condition). Small andLarge Changes received 10, face-to-face group sessions (months 1-4), and two4-week refresher courses each subsequent year. Body weight and PA wereobjectively-measured at baseline, 4¾months, 1 and 2¾years. Daily steps andbout-related moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA: _3 METs, _10-min bouts) wascalculated.RESULTS: Changes in bout-related MVPA and daily steps did not differ amongtreatment groups over the 2-year period (p's_>_0.16). Collapsed across groups,participants gaining >1¾lb. (n_=_187; 39.6%) had smaller changes in bout-related MVPA at 4¾months, 1 and 2¾years relative to those maintaining or losing weight(_1¾lb. weight gain; n_=_282, 60.4%, p's_<_0.05). Averaged across time points,this difference equated to 47.8¾min/week. Those gaining and not gaining >1¾lb.did not differ on daily steps (p's_>_0.10). Among participants engaging in_250¾min/wk. of MVPA at 2¾years (n_=_181), 30% gained >1¾lb. from baseline to2¾years, which was not different from those engaging in 150-250¾min/wk.

Regardless of group assignment, higher levels of MVPA wereassociated with better weight gain prevention over 2¾years. Our data suggest thatachieving >150¾min/week of MVPA is needed for weight gain prevention and thatincreasing MVPA, rather than steps, should be targeted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01183689).

Comparing the Levels of Acute-Phase Reactants Between Smoker and Nonsmoker Diabetic Patients: More Predicted Risk for Cardiovascular Diseases in Smoker Compared to Nonsmoker Diabetics.,/pubmed/29202548,"¾Due to a close link between cardiovascular disorders and increased acute phaseresponses, it is now proposed the relation of total sialic acid (TSA) and CReactive Protein (CRP) as main components of acute phase proteins andcardiovascular risk profiles such as diabetes mellitus and smoking. Wehypothesized that the elevation in the level of TSA along with other prototypeacute phase reactants such as CRP is expected more in the coexistence of diabetesand smoking than in diabetes mellitus alone. Ninety diabetic patients wererandomly selected and entered into this case-control study. Using blockrandomization method, the patients were randomly assigned into smokers (n=45) andnonsmokers (n=45). A group of ten healthy individuals was also included as thecontrol. The serum levels of TSA, CRP, iron, and hemoglobin were measured by the specific techniques. Comparing laboratory parameters across the three groupsindicated significantly higher levels of TSA and CRP in smoker diabetics ascompared to non-smoker diabetics and the healthy controls, while there was nodifference in other parameters including serum iron and hemoglobin. A significantpositive correlation was also revealed between TCA and CRP (r=0.324, P=0.030),but no significant association was found between other parameters. In thebackground of smoking, increasing the level of both TSA and CRP is predicted morethan the existence of diabetes mellitus alone. In fact, the increase in thesebiomarkers is more predictable in smoker than in nonsmoker diabetics. Thisfinding emphasizes the increased risk for cardiovascular disorders in smokercompared to non-smoker diabetics.",N,,,,,,,,,,

Blood lactose after dairy product intake in healthy men.,/pubmed/29198188,"The absence of a dedicated transport for disaccharides in the intestineimplicates that the metabolic use of dietary lactose relies on its priorhydrolysis at the intestinal brush border. Consequently, lactose in blood orurine has mostly been associated with specific cases in which thegastrointestinal barrier is damaged. On the other hand, lactose appears in theblood of lactating women and has been detected in the blood and urine of healthy men, indicating that the presence of lactose in the circulation of healthysubjects is not incompatible with normal physiology. In this cross-over study we have characterised the postprandial kinetics of lactose, and its majorconstituent, galactose, in the serum of fourteen healthy men who consumed aunique dose of 800 g milk or yogurt. Genetic testing for lactase persistence and microbiota profiling of the subjects were also performed. Data revealed thatlactose does appear in serum after dairy intake, although with delayed kineticscompared with galactose. Median serum concentrations of approximately 0à02 mmol/llactose and approximately 0à2 mmol/l galactose were observed after the ingestion of milk and yogurt respectively. The serum concentrations of lactose wereinversely correlated with the concentrations of galactose, and the variabilityobserved between the subjects' responses could not be explained by the presenceof the lactase persistence allele.

Abdominal Obesity Is Associated WithÎ¾anÎ¾Increased Risk of All-Cause Mortality in Patients With HFpEF.,/pubmed/29191321,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies that evaluate the association betweenabdominal obesity and subsequent outcomes in patients with heart failure withpreserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the association between abdominalobesity and risk of all-cause mortality in patients with HFpEF.METHODS: The present study used data from the TOPCAT (Treatment of PreservedCardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial. The primaryoutcome was all-cause mortality. We analyzed and compared the hazard ratios (HRs)in patients with abdominal obesity and those without abdominal obesity usingmultivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of¾_102¾cm in men and¾_88¾cm in women.RESULTS: The present study included 3,310 patients with HFpEF: 2,413 patientswith abdominal obesity and 897 without abdominal obesity. The mean follow-up was 3.4 ± 1.7 years. During follow-up, 500 patients died. All-cause mortality ratesin patients with and without abdominal obesity were 46.1 and 40.7 events per1,000 person-years, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, the risk ofall-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with abdominal obesitythan in those without abdominal obesity (adjusted HR: 1.52; 95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 1.16 to 1.99; p¾=¾0.002). The risk of cardiovascular andnoncardiovascular mortality was also significantly higher in patients withabdominal obesity than in those without abdominal obesity (adjusted HR: 1.50; 95%CI: 1.08 to 2.08; p¾=¾0.01 and adjusted HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.00 to 2.51; p¾=¾0.04,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patientswith HFpEF with abdominal obesity than in those without abdominal obesity.",N,,,,,,,,,,
"Acute glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes of three strategies for interrupting prolonged sitting time in postmenopausal women: A pilot, laboratory-based, randomized, controlled, 4-condition, 4-period crossover trial.",/pubmed/29190761,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting is associated with cardiometabolic and vasculardisease. Despite emerging evidence regarding the acute health benefits ofinterrupting prolonged sitting time, the effectiveness of different modalities inolder adults (who sit the most) is unclear.METHODS: In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 10 sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women (mean age 66 years ±9; mean body mass index 30.6 kg/m2 ±4.2) in a 4-condition, 4-period crossover feasibilitypilot study in San Diego to test 3 different sitting interruption modalitiesdesigned to improve glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes compared to a prolongedsitting control condition. The interruption modalities included: a) 2 minutesstanding every 20 minutes; b) 2 minutes walking every hour; and c) 10 minutesstanding every hour. During each 5-hr condition, participants consumed twoidentical, standardized meals. Blood samples, blood pressure, and heart rate werecollected every 30 minutes. Endothelial function of the superficial femoralartery was measured at baseline and end of each 5-hr condition usingflow-mediated dilation (FMD). Participants completed each condition on separatedays, in randomized order. This feasibility pilot study was not powered to detectstatistically significant differences in the various outcomes, however, analytic methods (mixed models) were used to test statistical significance within thesmall sample size.RESULTS: Nine participants completed all 4 study visits, one participantcompleted 3 study visits and then was lost to follow up. Net incremental areaunder the curve (iAUC) values for postprandial plasma glucose and insulin during the 5-hr sitting interruption conditions were not significantly differentcompared to the control condition. Exploratory analyses revealed that the2-minute standing every 20 minutes and the 2-minute walking every hour conditionswere associated with a significantly lower glycemic response to the second mealcompared to the first meal (i.e., condition-matched 2-hour post-lunch glucoseiAUC was lower than 2-hour post-breakfast glucose iAUC) that withstood Bonferronicorrection (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0084, respectively). Using allometrically scaleddata, the 10-minute standing every hour condition resulted in an improved FMDresponse, which was significantly greater than the control condition afterBonferroni correction (p = 0.0033).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that brief interruptions in prolonged sittingtime have modality-specific glucoregulatory and vascular benefits and arefeasible in an older adult population. Larger laboratory and real-worldintervention studies of pragmatic and effective methods to change sitting habits are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02743286.",RCT,,,,2 minutes standing every 20 minutes,2 minutes walking every hour,10 minutes standing every hour,,Postmenopausal women,Net incremental area under the curve (iAUC) values for postprandial plasma glucose and insulin during the 5-hr sitting interruption conditions,
Development of a Novel Six-Month Nutrition Intervention for a Randomized Trial in Older Men with Mobility Limitations.,/pubmed/29188864,"OBJECTIVES: Nutrition impacts the development of sarcopenia and protein intake isan important modulator of skeletal muscle mass loss in older people. TheOptimizing Protein Intake in Older Men with Mobility Limitation (OPTIMEN) Trialwas designed to assess the independent and combined effects of higher proteinintake and a promyogenic agent, testosterone, on lean body mass, muscle strength and physical function in older men with mobility disability. The purpose of this paper is to describe the experimental design and nutrition intervention,including techniques used by research dietitians to develop and deliver energyand protein-specific meals to the homes of community-dwelling participants.Strategies to enhance long-term dietary compliance are detailed.DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month interventiontrial.SETTING: Participants were recruited from Boston MA USA and surroundingcommunities.PARTICIPANTS: Older men who were mobility-limited (Short Physical PerformanceBattery (SPPB) 3-10) and consuming less protein (<0.83 g/kg/day) were recruitedfor this study.INTERVENTION: Here we report the successful implementation of a double-blind,placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomized controlled trial with a 6-monthintervention period among community-living men, age 65 years and older with amobility limitation. A controlled feeding plan was used to deliver requiredenergy intakes and prescribed protein quantities of 0.8 or 1.3 grams/kilogram/day(g/kg/d) in three meals plus snacks and supplements. A 2x2 factorial design wasused to assess the effects of protein level alone and in combination withtestosterone (vs. placebo) on changes in lean body mass (primary outcome), musclestrength, and physical function.RESULTS: A total of 154 men met the eligibility criteria; 112 completed a 2-week run-in period designed to evaluate compliance with the nutrition intervention. Ofthese, 92 subjects met compliance eligibility criteria and agreed to berandomized; 85% completed the full trial. The study successfully delivered three meals per day to subjects, with a high degree of compliance and subjectsatisfaction. Overall self-reported compliance rates were 80% and 93% for themeals and supplements, respectively. Details of compliance strategies arediscussed.CONCLUSION: This community-based study design may serve as a model forlonger-term nutritional interventions requiring monitoring of dietary compliance in a home-based feeding and supplementation trial.",N,,Y,,,,,,,,
The Effect of Telemedicine Follow-up Care on Diabetes-Related Foot Ulcers: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial.,/pubmed/29187423,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether telemedicine (TM) follow-up of patients withdiabetes-related foot ulcers (DFUs) in primary health care in collaboration with specialist health care was noninferior to standard outpatient care (SOC) forulcer healing time. Further, we sought to evaluate whether the proportion ofamputations, deaths, number of consultations per month, and patient satisfaction differed between the two groups.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with DFUs were recruited from threeclinical sites in western Norway (2012-2016). The cluster-randomized controllednoninferiority trial included 182 adults (94/88 in the TM/SOC groups) in 42municipalities/districts. The intervention group received TM follow-up care inthe community; the control group received SOC. The primary end point was healing time. Secondary end points were amputation, death, number of consultations permonth, and patient satisfaction.RESULTS: Using mixed-effects regression analysis, we found that TM wasnoninferior to SOC regarding healing time (mean difference -0.43 months, 95% CI-1.50, 0.65). When competing risk from death and amputation were taken intoaccount, there was no significant difference in healing time between the groups(subhazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.85, 1.59). The TM group had a significantly lowerproportion of amputations (mean difference -8.3%, 95% CI -16.3%, -0.5%), andthere were no significant differences in the proportion of deaths, number ofconsultations, or patient satisfaction between groups, although the direction of the effect estimates for these clinical outcomes favored the TM group.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that use of TM technology can be a relevantalternative and supplement to usual care, at least for patients with moresuperficial ulcers.",RCT,,,,Telemedicine,Standard outpatient care,,,Patients with diabetes related foot ulcers,Ulcer healing time,
Glycemic control and adipokines after periodontal therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.,/pubmed/29185604,"The mechanism by which chronic periodontitis (CP) affects type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects ofperiodontal therapy (PT) on the glycemic control and adipokines of patients with T2DM and CP with the purpose of elucidating the possible mechanisms by which CPinfluences T2DM. Forty-four patients with T2DM and CP were randomly divided into two groups according to whether they underwent PT. Periodontal status, bloodglucose, and the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor _ (TNF-_), interleukin-6(IL-6), adiponectin (APN), and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) were measuredat baseline and after 3 months. The results revealed that the probing depth (PD) and attachment loss (AL) were significantly improved, the serum levels of TNF-_and IL-6 were significantly decreased, and APN and FGF-21 exhibited substantialincreases in the intervention group after 3 months (p < 0.05), whereas nosignificant changes were observed in the control group. The glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c) levels in both groups decreased significantly after 3 months comparedwith baseline (p < 0.05), but the intervention group exhibited a significantlygreater change (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PT may relieve periodontalinflammation, which causes a reduction of insulin-antagonizing adipokines and an increase in insulin-sensitizing adipokines, thereby eliciting an improvement inglycemic control.",RCT,,,,Periodontal therapy,Control group,,,Patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis,Glycemic control and adipokines,
Effect of Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS) on Endothelial Cell Count.,/pubmed/29185403,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the change in endothelial cell count after femtosecondlaser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) versus conventional phacoemulsification.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi,Pakistan from January 2016 to August 2017.METHODOLOGY: Patients with senile cataract and age ranging from 40 to 80 yearswere included in the study. Patients with any other cause of endothelial cellloss, history of trauma, documented diabetes millitis, hypertention and glaucoma were excluded. Preoperative detailed ocular examination, including both anterior and posterior examination, was carried out. Patients were distributed into twogroups. Group GP were planned for conventional phacoemulsification, while groupGF underwent FLACS. All the surgeries were performed under local anesthesia bysame ophthalmic surgeon. Specular microscope (Topcon specular microscopesp-3000p) was utilized to measure the endothelial cell count (ECC) before and 4weeks after the surgery.RESULTS: Fifty eyes (25 in each group) of 48 patients underwent cataract surgery by phacoemulsification or FLACS. Twenty-five (52.08%) out of the total werefemales while 23 (47.91%) were males.

Laser photobiomodulation in pressure ulcer healing of human diabetic patients: gene expression analysis of inflammatory biochemical markers.,/pubmed/29181642,"Pressure ulcers (PU) are wounds located mainly on bone surfaces where the tissue under pressure suffers ischemia leading to cellular lesion and necrosis , itscauses and the healing process depend on several factors. The aim of this studywas evaluating the gene expression of inflammatory/reparative factors: IL6, TNF, VEGF, and TGF, which take part in the tissue healing process under effects oflow-level laser therapy (LLLT). In order to perform lesion area analysis, PUswere photographed and computer analyzed. Biochemical analysis was performedsa.mpling ulcer border tissue obtained through biopsy before and after lasertherapy and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The study comprisedeight individuals, mean age sixty-two years old, and sacroiliac and calcaneousPU, classified as degree III and IV according to the National Pressure UlcerAdvisory Panel (NPUAP). PUs were irradiated with low-level laser (InGaAIP,100¾mW, 660¾nm), energy density 2¾J/cm2, once a day, with intervals of 24¾h,totaling 12 applications. The lesion area analysis revealed averaged improvement of the granulation tissue size up to 50% from pre- to post-treatment. qRT-PCRanalysis revealed that IL6 values were not significantly different before andafter treatment, TNF gene expression was reduced, and VEFG and TGF-_ geneexpression increased after treatment. After LLLT, wounds presented improvement ingross appearance, with increase in factors VEFG and TGF-_, and reduction of TNF; despite our promising results, they have to be analyzed carefully as this studydid not have a control group.",N,,,,,,,,,,
